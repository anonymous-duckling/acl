The woman on the left is pointing at a tablet that the man on the right is holding. Both are wearing black jackets and hats. The cockpit is filled with various screens and controls.\n\n### **Training in India**\n\nThe Dassault Skill Academy program is designed to support the growth of our manufacturing operations in India. Our engineering center in Pune is fully operational. We have established the Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter diploma program in the state of Maharashtra, and we are in the process of expanding it to the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n### **Profit‑sharing**\n\nOur compensation policy is designed to attract, reward and foster employee loyalty, while remaining attuned to evolving economic circumstances. Our incentives policy is extremely competitive: in 2023, the average amount of profit-sharing and incentive payments made to Dassault Aviation parent company employees in respect of the 2022 fiscal year, was equivalent to four months' salary.\n\nPromoting diversity and training\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Environmental footprint management**\n\n**We are implementing an energy efficiency plan focusing on four key priorities to cut emissions generated by business aviation: SAF sustainable fuels, flight operations optimization, research & technology and CO2 storage.**\n\n### **Business aviation and carbon emissions**\n\nWe are committed to reducing emissions to achieve the worldwide target of carbon neutrality in the aviation sector by 2050.\n\nIn one year, the 2,100 Falcon jets in operation emit the equivalent of a day's worth of global video streaming, 5 hours' worth of global truck traffic, or 2.5 days' worth of German fossil fuel power production. Business aviation accounts for 0.04% of global CO2 emissions.\n\n### **EU taxonomy**\n\nWe have filed an action for annulment with the General Court of the European Union against the regulation excluding business aviation from the European taxonomy of sustainable economic activities. This action is based primarily on a breach of the principle of equality with respect to the other categories of aircraft included in the taxonomy. It also highlights a manifest misunderstanding, as business aviation is a key driver in the decarbonization of the aviation sector.\n\n### **Sustainable fuels plan**\n\nIn 2023, Dassault Aviation operated 413 Falcon flights using 30% SAF blends, compared with 179 in 2022. These flights resulted in CO2 savings of 681 tonnes over the course of the year.\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Dassault Aviation and the ADP Group announced a five-year agreement to step up their efforts to reduce carbon emissions at Paris-Le Bourget airport: supply and use of SAF, electrification of ground operations, geothermal energy to power buildings and hangars.\n\n### **Research and technology**\n\nWe are actively involved in the European Clean Aviation initiative, as well as in France's civil aviation research council (Corac). Our work is focused particularly on cutting fuel consumption by reducing aircraft drag, as well as by the use of SAF.\n\n### **Optimizing flight operations**\n\nDassault Aviation has developed FalconWays, an innovative tool for optimizing flight plans, which was awarded the *Aviation Week Laureate Award* in November 2023. The proven reductions in fuel consumption achieved are up to 7%.\n\nOur other contributions to optimizing air traffic operations include advances in flexibility, avionics, flight controls and the FalconEye Combined Vision System (CVS).\n\n### **CO2 storage**\n\nIn addition, Dassault Aviation is a major corporate sponsor of the Maubuisson forest in the Val-d'Oise department of France. Thanks to the planting of a million trees of thirty different species on an unused lowland plain, this 3,300-acre forest will benefit the 100,000 inhabitants of the seven neighboring towns as well as twelve million people living in the Greater Paris region.\n\n### **Energy efficiency plan**\n\nOur energy efficiency plan, launched at the end of 2022, began to produce significant results in 2023. Our consumption of energy (electricity, gas, fuel oil) fell by 13.5% compared with 2019 levels.\n\nWe are one of the European companies that have achieved the greatest reductions according to the *Financial Times*'s Europe's Climate Leaders 2023 ranking.\n\n### **The circular economy**\n\nOur careful approach to waste management means that we have achieved a recovery rate of 86%, and our efforts are ongoing. For instance, we are pioneers when it comes to the recycling of composite waste materials.\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuels, energy efficiency\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nFlight Card Trajectory\n\n410 Update Weather\n\nNEW TRAJECTORY\nComputation success!\nTIME (min) -3 FUEL -1635\nCO₂ (t) -2.34\nCancel Apply Details\n\nLFPS\n\n08:00\n500\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n\nVASB\n\n4116 NM\neDispatch FalconPert eWB EPM Store\n\n33\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Mirage 2000\n\nThe highlight for 2023 was the acceptance by the United Arab Emirates of the SAD95 standard for the M2000-9.\n\n#### Future Combat Air System (FCAS)\n\nThe FCAS consists of creating a combat system built around a New Generation Fighter (NGF) combining piloted platforms (current and future generation fighters, tankers, AWACS) and drones. France has been designated lead nation on the project and Dassault Aviation lead contractor on the NGF.\n\nDassault Aviation is lead architect of pillar 1, the NGF, and is involved (as co-contractor or subcontractor) in pillars 3, 4, 5 and 7, as well as in item 0 (continuation of joint concept studies with the military and preparation of the operating system).\n\nDetailed specification for the development of the demonstrator, corresponding to Phase 1B of the contract awarded at the end of 2022, began in March 2023. A physical workspace was created in Saint-Cloud to welcome industrial teams from the three partner countries.\n\nFor the New Generation Fighter, the decision to move to phase 2 should be taken in line with a contracting in 2026 for a 1st flight of the demonstrator in 2029.\n\n### Eurodrone (Medium Altitude Long-Endurance drone)\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Airbus and the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) signed the Eurodrone contract relative to the development, the production and the 5-year maintenance of 20 systems.\n\nAirbus Defence and Space GmbH signed the contract as prime contractor, on behalf of the three main contractors, Airbus Defence and Space SAU in Spain, Dassault Aviation in France and Leonardo SpA in Italy.\n\nOCCAR represents the first four countries to order: Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nDassault Aviation is specifically in charge of flight control and mission communication systems. Work is continuing.\n\n### Multi-mission aircraft\n\nFor the multi-mission aircraft, the following key events took place in 2023.\n\n- Albatros: continued development of the \"AVSIMAR\" (maritime surveillance and response aircraft) on a Falcon 2000LXS platform (for the record: 7 aircraft ordered, with an option for a further 5),\n- Archange: continued development of the strategic intelligence aircraft based on a Falcon 8X platform (for the record: 2 aircraft ordered, with an option for 1 more),\n- ATL2: the 7th modernized aircraft has been delivered to the French Defense Procurement Agency (the last aircraft modernized by Dassault Aviation),\n- Future maritime patrol aircraft (PATMAR): launch of the architectural design based on the Falcon 10X (in competition with Airbus).\n\nIn Export, the highlight for 2023 was the delivery of 2 of the 4 \"green\" Falcon 2000 ordered by South Korea in 2022.\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, 23 orders were recorded and 26 Falcon delivered, compared with a guidance of 35, versus 64 orders and 32 deliveries in 2022.\n\nAfter being certified on August 22, 2023, the Falcon 6X including the application of post-certification improvements approved by the EASA entered into service on November 30, 2023.\n\nAn inflationary context, fears of a recession and banking crises weighed on demand for business jets.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness aviation traffic in the high-end segment remained stable in 2023 compared with 2022. The market for pre-owned aircraft was strong, although pre-owned aircraft inventories for sale increased to the same level as 2020.\n\nWe are continuing to enhance the Falcon range with the entry into service in November 2023 of the Falcon 6X and the continued development of the Falcon 10X. The Group is also improving its aircraft in service with the new EASy IV avionics proposed for the Falcon 7X/8X (13 upgrades made in 2023) and the Falcon Privacy Suite module proposed for the Falcon 8X (and for the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X).\n\n#### Falcon 6X\n\nThe Falcon 6X program was certified on August 22, 2023 and the aircraft entered into service on November 30, 2023. The first customer delivery was on February 2024. Moreover:\n\n- The industrial ramp-up comes at a time of supply chain difficulties,\n- Customer feedback confirm a very high level of passenger comfort (acoustics, lighting, stability in flight and during descent),\n- Performances at low speeds (take-off and landing distances) are better than expected,\n- The cabin has received several awards for its design (including the Red Dot Award and the International Yacht and Aviation Award for Interior Design).\n\n### Falcon 10X\n\nDevelopment continues and we have now entered the industrialization and production phase.\n\n- The definition of the detailed technical specifications has been completed and production of the first development aircraft is underway.\n- This brand new aircraft is characterized by its long range (7,500 nm, for example New York to Shanghai, Los Angeles to Sydney, or Paris to Santiago de Chile) and the size of its cabin, which is the most spacious on the market, while maintaining the operational capabilities of the Falcon family. It will offer unequaled cabin modularity in its category,\n- It is fitted with two Rolls Royce Pearl 10X 100% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)-compatible engines, will have a top speed of 0.925 Mach and will be able to land and take off on short runways, such as London City Airport,\n- It features innovations and technologies, some of which are borrowed from our military aircraft (smart throttle controlling the two engines, recovery mode, composite wingbox, dual head-up display for primary flight data, etc.) and a state-of-the-art cockpit,\n- The program timeline has been adjusted,\n- The first deliveries are scheduled for 2027.\n\n### Business aviation and European Taxonomy for Transport\n\nBusiness aviation has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050; the segment currently generates 2% of global aviation CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, i.e. 0.04% of global CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. As a reminder, one year of global 2,100 Falcon fleet utilization is equivalent to 24 hours of global video streaming, 5 hours of worldwide truck traffic or 2.5 days of the German thermal power plants.\n\nBusiness aviation is excluded from \"green\" taxonomy, unlike commercial aviation. This exclusion is regrettable at a time when business aviation is a pioneer in decarbonization, notably thanks to its use of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and the optimization of missions. Supply chain SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises will be the first to suffer as this exclusion means that their access to financing will be more limited while they are already facing several difficulties.\n\nConsidering this exclusion being unjustified and not in accordance with European Union law, Dassault Aviation lodged on February 14th, 2024 an action for annulment with the General Court of the\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nEuropean Union, calling for the annulment of this provision and for the European commission to define criteria for the inclusion of business aviation in the taxonomy.\n\nAt the same time, the United States has launched an investment plan of more than USD 390 billion for clean energy and notably for SAF. Europe has a different approach, putting less funding on the table and imposing standards. The European approach continues to favor taxation and exclusion over incentives.\n\n### Four cornerstones to decarbonize business aviation\n\nDassault Aviation is active in the four main areas which will facilitate the decarbonization of the business aviation sector:\n\n- SAF: all Falcon models are certified to fly with SAF/kerosene blends of up to 50%. Current alternative fuels (SAF) reduce carbon emissions by between 80 and 90% compared to kerosene. All Dassault Aviation flights, including in the United States, operate using 30% SAF mixes, the only ones currently available on the market. In 2023, Dassault Aviation operated 413 flights using 30% SAF mixes (vs. 179 in 2022). Aircraft in production will be 100% SAF compatible in 2030 (natively for the Falcon 10X).\n- Research and Technology:\n\t- o the developments of the new programs (Falcon 6X, Falcon 10X) and those added to the existing Falcon family aim to improve the aerodynamics of these aircraft, optimize mass and increase engine performance,\n\t- o Dassault Aviation takes part in research programs in France (CORAC) and internationally (Clean Aviation) in order to reduce fuel consumption by optimizing the aircraft design,\n- Optimization of air operations:\n\t- o existing Falcon tools and properties (flexibility, avionics and flight controls, FalconEye*,* etc.) are major assets for the future of air traffic management,\n\t- o Dassault Aviation has developed an innovative flight plan optimization tool, called \"FalconWays\" to reduce fuel consumption and CO<sup>2</sup> emissions and received the Aviation Week Laureate Award in November 2023,\n- CO<sup>2</sup> emission storage: the Group provides philanthropic support for forest renewal and biodiversity conservation. Dassault Aviation is a \"Major Patron\" of Maubuisson forest (Val d'Oise, Ile-de-France region) where a planting campaign was launched in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Groupe ADP and Dassault Aviation signed a five-year agreement to strengthen their decarbonization actions at Paris-Le Bourget airport (distribution and use of SAF, use of electric equipment for ground operations, use of geothermal power for airport buildings and hangars).\n\n### Make in India\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to step up activities transferred to India via Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) which, among others, produces sections T12 and T4 of the Falcon 2000.\n\nThe Group is also continuing to develop the Indian supply chain (primary parts, tools, pylons, tanks, etc.), by expanding its base of local partners and appointing new major sub-contractors. Major contracts were signed at the beginning of 2024:\n\n- DYNAMATIC for the T5 tank of the Falcon 6X and for the supply of primary parts,\n- AEROLLOY, a subsidiary of the PTC Group, for the development of a titanium foundry division.\n\nMoreover, Dassault Aviation is investing in the development of the Indian supply chain's human capital. In this regard, the \"Dassault Skill Academy\" (a vocational training program for aeronautical fitters and a prestigious higher education pathway) offers the \"Aeronautics Vocational Baccalaureate\" training program in the State of Mahārāshtra with a secondary program in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The engineering center in Pune is fully operational.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.5.2. Military support and Falcon support**\n\n### **Military support**\n\nThe dedication and organization of our teams throughout 2023 enabled us to meet the fleet availability commitments required by military customers in France and for Export.\n\nFor France and vertically integrated operational maintenance contracts for Rafale (RAVEL), ATL2 (OCEAN) and Mirage 2000 (Balzac), highlights included:\n\n- responses to the various government requests in relation to the war in Ukraine,\n- active participation with expected availability for High Intensity warfare exercises carried out by French forces involving the Rafale, Mirage 2000 and ATL2,\n- delivery of the first airframe inspection drones for the Rafale,\n- notification at the end of 2023 of additional means to equip the Rafale squadron at the Orange air base (France), including in particular the new version of the Mermoz test bench for electronic equipment testing,\n- the opening of one-stop logistic centers at the Luxeuil and Nancy Mirage 2000 air bases and the gradual reopening of electronic workshops in Nancy,\n- the presentation of the first \"EMAR certificates\" to French technicians and managers from the French Air and Space Force following their training at the Conversion Training Center in Mérignac (France), and monitoring of training resources made available within the French Air and Space Force (CFR-NG).\n\nMoreover, for the French Alpha Jet, negotiation of the Alpha Jet vertically integrated support contract resulted at the end of 2023 in the award of the Alpha Care contract for a period of five years.\n\nFor support for the use of fleets in service for Export customers, the main highlights included:\n\n- for Egypt, passing the milestone of 10,000 flying hours for the Rafale, logged by the Egyptian Air Force on February 28 in Berigat, and support work carried out for the execution of the contract for the additional Rafale,\n- for Qatar, renewal of our support contract for 2023 and preparation for 2024,\n- for India, renewal of the contracts of our Technical Assistant teams at the Ambala and Hasimara air bases,\n- for Greece, steadily increasing aviation activity following the delivery of aircraft throughout the year with a fleet of 6 new and 12 pre-owned Rafale at the end of 2023,\n- for Croatia, the deliveries of parts and customer support systems, the customer's first aircraft have been made available in Mérignac, the arrival of Croatian pilots and technicians during the second half of 2023 and the beginning of Rafale training at our Conversion Training Center,\n- for the United Arab Emirates, we launched our support products and services and held regular meetings with our customer to prepare installations in the country,\n- for Indonesia, launch of support products and services corresponding to the notification of batch 1 and 2 of the contract.\n\n### **Falcon support**\n\nIn terms of Falcon support, 2023 saw:\n\n the growth of the Group's network of maintenance centers, now made up of more than 60 sites across the world: including the opening in 2023 of a new ExecuJet maintenance center in Dubai (to replace the old center),\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Corporate Social Responsibility performance indicator\n\nThis indicator covers the Parent Company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions excluding kerosene, expressed as a function of worked hours and reference meteorological conditions. In 2022, carbon emissions within this scope were 15,144 T. In 2023, these emissions were 14,055 T representing a decrease of 7.2%.\n\n### **Scope 3 indirect emissions**\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Dassault Aviation carried out studies in collaboration with a firm of experts to identify decarbonization opportunities for its indirect emissions that could contribute to its low-carbon strategy. In 2023, work continued with all Executive Management teams to build the foundations of the climate transition plan.\n\n#### Purchases of products and services\n\nThis category was quantified using the methodology developed by the IAEG (International Aerospace Environmental Group) as part of the low-carbon plan.\n\nInitiatives have also been launched to raise the awareness of the supply chain to climate and environmental issues, including through specific contractual clauses and a supplier approval process incorporating environmental aspects.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to a commitment charter on relations between customers and suppliers in the aviation industry. As such, the company contributes to the work led by GIFAS (French Aerospace Industries Group) to rally the industry behind the shared goals of reducing the carbon footprint of aviation.\n\nDassault Aviation is involved in IAEG Working Group 11 (WG11), which is tasked with rolling out ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards within the aviation supply chain. One of the missions of this group was to select a platform capable of assessing and sharing information on supplier practices and which includes a carbon component. The EcoVadis platform is thus currently being rolled out within the aviation sector. Dassault System is studying the possibility of integrating this platform into its current assessment process.\n\n### Upstream and downstream freight transport\n\nLogistics platforms contribute to the optimization of transport flows and the associated CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. Environmental criteria, mainly relating to greenhouse gas emissions and the climate transition, were tightened in the Parent Company's invitation to tender for transport services when it was last revised at the end of 2023.\n\nMoreover, discussions took place in 2023 with innovative companies to consider groundbreaking transport solutions, notably transatlantic freight transit by sail.\n\n#### Business travel\n\nTravel remains below 2019 levels. The intensive use of collaborative tools and videoconferencing is contributing to this decline.\n\nThe Parent Company's travel policy encourages the use of trains for journeys of less than three hours. Under the terms of vehicle rental agreements for business trips, electric vehicles must be provided\n\nwherever possible, which at the Parent Company level resulted in an increase from less than 1% of journeys using electric vehicles in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023.\n\n#### Use of Falcon products sold\n\nThe reduction in fuel consumption and the corresponding carbon footprint is a historic concern of Dassault Aviation. Falcon aircraft are recognized as being among the least-emitting aircraft on the market with an equivalent range. To go further, many actions are being taken both in the technical and operational fields and in alternative fuels (see Section 4.7.1).\n\nModeling studies of emissions from Falcon aircraft delivered during the year are ongoing, according to the \"GHG Protocol\" method, taking into account the ramp-up of the SAF. Indeed, given the significant potential for reducing the carbon emissions of these fuels, the progressive use of the different\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\ngenerations of SAF in the air activity of business aviation makes it possible to consider a significant reduction of the carbon footprint over the aircraft lifetime.\n\n#### Travel to and from work\n\nThe employee mobility survey conducted during the first quarter of 2022 provided input for the Quality of Life and Working Conditions agreement signed on February 14, 2023 and which now includes a sustainable mobility component.\n\nSeveral measures implemented under this agreement help mitigate carbon emissions. For example, the formalization of remote working, on a regular basis or exceptionally when necessary, as well as the promotion of three virtuous modes of transport: bicycle, carpooling and low-emission vehicles, while continuing to encourage the use of public transport.\n\n### Impacts of climate change\n\nWork to identify physical risks related to climate change adaptation was undertaken by the Group. The aim of this work is to identify whether the sites of the Dassault Aviation Group, its subsidiaries and its supply chain are exposed to climate risk either currently or in the medium and long term using climate modeling scenarios.\n\nActions to reduce the environmental footprint of the Group's products and activities help mitigate the transition risks linked to climate change described in Chapter 2 \"Risk factors\", particularly market risks.\n\nThese elements are the input data for our transition plan.\n\n### **4.7.5. European Green Taxonomy**\n\n### **Regulatory context**\n\nTo promote transparency and a long-term vision of economic activities and to direct capital flows toward sustainable investments, the European Union has created a common classification system for business activities to identify economic activities considered sustainable. This system is defined in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the \"Taxonomy Regulation\") and is applicable since publication on the 2021 financial statements.\n\nTo determine whether an activity can be considered sustainable (aligned), it must:\n\n- Contribute substantially to one or more of the following environmental objectives:\n\t- climate change mitigation,\n\t- climate change adaptation,\n\t- the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\n\t- the transition to a circular economy,\n\t- pollution prevention and control,\n\t- the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- Comply with technical screening criteria established by the Commission,\n- Not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives,\n- Be carried out in compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights (minimum social safeguards).\n\nCompanies must disclose the share of their net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure associated with \"eligible\" (i.e. classified in the European Taxonomy) and \"aligned\" or \"sustainable\" economic activities (according to the rules listed above).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe publication of new Delegated Regulations 2023/2485 and 2023/2486 in November 2023 make new economic activities, including aviation activities, eligible for the six environmental objectives. These activities are set out in Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 and only meet the objective of mitigating climate change. For the 2023 fiscal year (2024 publication), only eligibility must be published for these new activities which were added in 2023.\n\n#### **Scope of analysis**\n\nThe net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure considered cover all the activities of the Dassault Aviation Group and correspond to the scope of consolidation of the financial statements defined in Note 2 of the 2023 consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs a result, the ratio calculations presented below do not take into account the entities over which the Dassault Aviation Group has joint control or significant influence, in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021.\n\n#### **Eligible and aligned activities under the taxonomy**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has reviewed its activities in all sectors defined:\n\n- in Annexes I and II of the supplementary Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, including its amended version following the publication of Delegated Regulation 2023/2485\n- in Annexes I to IV of Delegated Regulation 2023/2486 relating to the four environmental objectives.\n\nThe addition of aviation in Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 classes Dassault Aviation Group's main activity as eligible for the objective of mitigating climate change.\n\nThe analysis of the eligibility and alignment of CapEx and OpEx also focused on \"individual measures\" (i.e., other than those related to aviation), enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to achieve greenhouse gas reductions, as defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. Nevertheless, the share of expenses related to these activities is deemed non material.\n\nAs a result, all net sales, CapEx and OpEx are attributed to the aircraft manufacturing activity and are therefore 100% eligible.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturing activity will be included in the acts published in 2023 and is not subject to alignment criteria for the current fiscal year.\n\n### **Procedures for determining eligibility and alignment ratios**\n\nThe financial ratios were defined in accordance with the definitions given in Annex I to the Delegated Act of July 6, 2021.\n\nWith regard to net sales:\n\n as the aviation Delegated Act has been published, all net sales are declared as eligible under the \"3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft\" activity (cf. Note 15 to the Consolidated company financial statements).\n\nWith regard to capital expenditure (CapEx):\n\n- The denominator is taken directly from the Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements (after elimination of intra-group transactions). The scope covered corresponds to the entire scope of the consolidated financial statements, excluding associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. Capital expenditure includes inflows of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the fiscal year under review, before depreciation, amortization and revaluation, and inflows of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from business combinations.\n- The numerator is equal to total capital expenditure included in the denominator as related to assets associated with the eligible activity.\n\nIn total, eligible CapEx is valued at EUR 440 million and represents 100% of Group CapEx (see Note 4 to the consolidated company financial statements).\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to operating expenditure (OpEx):\n\n- The denominator is taken directly from the Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements (after elimination of intra-group transactions). The scope covered corresponds to the entire scope of the consolidated financial statements, excluding associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The denominator covers direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n- in terms of the numerator, it is equal to the total expenditure listed in the denominator as related to the eligible activity. However, this expenditure is insignificant (10%) in relation to the Group's overall operating expenditure (see consolidated income statement). Consequently, the Group considers that the eligible OpEx is not material for its business model and its business sector<sup>1</sup>.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Pursuant to Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 of July 6, 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Financial<br>year N                                                                                                                  | Economic<br>Activities<br>(1) | Code<br>(2) | Turn-<br>over<br>(3) | Propor-<br>tion of<br>Turn-<br>over<br>(4) | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (5) | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (6)     | Water (7) | Pollution (8) | Circular Economy<br>(9) | Biodiversity (10) | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (11)                | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (12) | Water (13) | Pollution (14) | Circular Economy<br>(15) | Biodiversity (16) | Minimum Safeguards<br>(17) | Proportion<br>of<br>Taxonomy<br>aligned<br>(A.1.) or<br>eligible<br>(A.2.)<br>Turnover,<br>year N-1<br>(18) | Category<br>enabling<br>activity<br>(19) | Category<br>transitional<br>activity<br>(20) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                      |                               | 2023        |                      |                                            |                                  | Substantial Contribution<br>Criteria |           |               |                         |                   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not<br>Significantly Harm') |                                   |            |                |                          |                   |                            |                                                                                                             |                                          |                                              |\n| A.

Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n### **Responsibility of the Company**\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for:\n\n- selecting or determining the appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented with respect to these risks as well as the outcomes of these policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by applying the company's Guidelines as referred to above.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Independent Third Party**\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fairness of the historical information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks.\n\nWe conducted our work in order to provide a reasoned opinion expressing a moderate level of assurance on the historical, observed and extrapolated information.\n\nAs it is our responsibility to issue an independent conclusion on the Information prepared by management, we are not authorized to participate in the preparation of the Information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to provide a conclusion on:\n\n- the company's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the duty of vigilance and the fight against corruption and tax evasion);\n- the accuracy of information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance**\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and acting as the verification program and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\nThis report has been drawn up in accordance with the CSR\\_SQ\\_Verification program\\_NFPD\n\n### **Independence and quality control**\n\nOur independence is defined by Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie). In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n### **Means and resources**\n\nOur work engaged the skills of five people between November 2023 and February 2024 and took a total of four weeks.\n\nWe conducted some ten interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular the environment health and safety, human resources, ethics and anticorruption departments.\n\n### **Nature and scope of procedures**\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures conducted in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- we familiarized ourselves with all the activities of the companies in the consolidation scope and the description of the principal risks;\n- we assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector;\n- we verified that the Statement covers each category of information stipulated in section III of Article L. 225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the principal risks associated with the activities of all the consolidated entities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n\n",

Every aspect of human activity is being viewed through this lens. The aviation industry is no exception, and rightly so, even though its CO2 emissions account for only around 2% of total human emissions. Our industry is committed to achieving \"net zero\" emissions by 2050, and is focusing on technological innovation to meet this target, in keeping with its long history of achievement in this regard. However, the assessment criteria need to be scientific and not ideological, as is sometimes the case when it comes to business aviation. In this respect, the EU taxonomy of economic activities that are environmentally sustainable is misguided, which is why we have called for it to be amended. The European Union is too often in the business of imposing restrictions and taxes, whereas the United States tends to favor incentives and greater streamlining.\n\nA host of questions are being raised. And many of these questions are going to be answered in 2024, with major elections scheduled in Europe and the United States, as well as in India.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Against this backdrop, how should the tremendous success of the Rafale in export markets be viewed?**\n\nThe Rafale began to make inroads in the export market in 2015, well before the invasion of Ukraine. So far, this attack has not prompted or boosted any of our commercial deals – quite the opposite, in fact. Responsible countries arm themselves in peacetime, in order to protect the peace. In times of conflict, however, everything becomes more challenging, as can be seen from the debate currently taking place in France in relation to the \"war economy.\" Producing complex weapons systems takes time. Given the length of manufacturing cycles, we need to be proactive when it comes to planning or stepping up production.\n\nThe Rafale's success stems from a combination of factors: the outstanding combat-tested qualities of the aircraft, the loyalty of our customers (all of whom were already using Mirage 2000, with the exception of Croatia and Indonesia), the changing geopolitical landscape (a multipolar world, with American power increasingly focused on Asia), and superb teamwork across the board in France (between political, military and industrial partners). To date, a total of 495 Rafale fighters have been ordered (519 if we include pre-owned aircraft, i.e., an export rate of 55%). And the momentum is showing no signs of slowing: we're continuing to step up our pace of production; we're in commercial negotiations with a number of countries; we're developing the F4 standard, featuring advanced connectivity capabilities; and we're preparing the F5 standard, which will include a combat drone.\n\n#### **Can you tell us about the outlook for the Falcon business?**\n\nIn the short term, we have a number of supply chain problems to deal with. Supplier failures combined with a lack of industrial capacity, mainly with regard to aerostructures, have resulted in delays to production launches. We have made adjustments to existing organizational arrangements and put in place a centralized management system to implement corrective action plans, provide the necessary support to some of our subcontractors and expand our operations in India. We are also aiming to grow our sales. In 2023, the delay in the certification and entry into service of the Falcon 6X meant that we were unable to start\n\nusing a demonstrator to showcase the aircraft until December; since the launch of this promotional campaign, the 6X's exceptional levels of performance have met with an enthusiastic response from current and prospective customers.\n\nIn the longer term, our focus is on completing development work on the Falcon 10X. We have recalibrated the project to allow for the backlogs that built up during and after the Covid crisis. Initial deliveries of this aircraft are now scheduled for 2027. Lastly, we are pursuing our efforts in the area of decarbonization, focusing on four key priorities: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, R&T, flight operations optimization and CO2 storage.\n\nIn light of these efforts as well as of our exceptionally healthy order book, we will need to maintain high levels of hiring: in 2023, we hired some 2,000 new employees, and we have set ourselves the same target for 2024. Dassault Aviation rates highly in all \"respected employer\" rankings. Our Group is an excellent place to work, whether you are an engineer, a technician or a skilled worker, whether your background is in design, production or support functions, whether you wish to work in France or overseas, or whether you are interested in the civil or military sector: we offer skilled men and women the opportunity to pursue varied and exciting careers, working together in the service of France and its aviation sector.\n\n> The company's top priority continues to be delivering Falcon and Rafale aircraft on time, thus ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>**Executive Committee**\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/4 description: A group of 17 people are standing in a room.

Ultimately, the 26 Rafale Marine fighters to be delivered to the Indian Navy would join the 36 Rafales already in service with the Indian Air Force. India is the first country outside France to have decided to field both versions of the Rafale.\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/5 description: A gray Rafale fighter jet is parked inside a large aircraft hangar.

This industrial sovereignty underpins the superiority of our air force.

Indonesia is a first-time military customer and our second Rafale customer in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/3 description: The image shows a gray fighter jet against a blue background.

The jet in the background has the number \"61\" written on the tail.\n\n### **Falcon 6X's entry into service**\n\nThe Falcon 6X entered service in November 2023, after its joint certification in August by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Its spacious cabin sets a new standard of comfort for aircraft capable of flying non-stop for more than 12 hours.\n\nThis success was a fitting climax to a year in which the Falcon family celebrated a milestone anniversary: sixty years since the Mystère 20's first flight in May 1963. Since then, we have launched 25 Falcon models and delivered more than 2,700 aircraft.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Expansion of Falcon MRO**\n\nOur global business jet support network has expanded to include over 60 maintenance centers. In 2023, our latest center opened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Three further facilities are scheduled to open in 2024 and 2025: Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, São Paulo in Brazil and Melbourne in Florida. One of the company's major maintenance facilities, Melbourne will have the capacity to handle up to 18 Falcon jets simultaneously.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/3 description: The image contains two separate photographs.

In early 2024, contracts were signed with Indian companies Dynamatic (for the manufacture of the Falcon 6X T5 section fuel tank and the supply of primary parts) and Aerolloy, a subsidiary of the PTC Group (for development of a titanium foundry).\n\nMeanwhile, we are pursuing our training and local skills development initiatives: the engineering center in Pune is fully operational, and the Dassault Skill Academy, which introduced the Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter diploma program in the state of Maharashtra, is in the process of expanding it to the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nLastly, Dassault Reliance Aviation Limited (DRAL) is continuing its operations, in particular the production of T12 and T4 sections of the Falcon 2000.\n\n### **New facilities**\n\nIn 2023, Dassault Aviation successfully completed a number of projects, specifically in preparation for the introduction of the Falcon 10X: a building to house the 10X simulator, in Istres; a building devoted to wing box systems, in Martignas; and refitting of the buildings where final assembly and special projects will take place, in Mérignac. We are also continuing construction work on our new Cergy plant, which is slated for completion in 2024.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/8 description: This is an aerial shot of a large industrial complex.

In the Universum 2023 ranking of the 130 most attractive employers among engineering school students in all fields, we came in among the top five; in addition, we were ranked in the top three most popular manufacturing companies among engineering students and graduates, according to an Epoka survey, based on a sample of 15,000 students and graduates.\n\n### **Reduced environmental footprint**\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Dassault Aviation and the ADP Group announced a five-year agreement to step up their efforts to reduce carbon emissions at Paris-Le Bourget airport.\n\nDassault Aviation was included in the *Financial Times*' Europe's Climate Leaders 2023 rankings of the top 300 European companies. This list features the companies that have made the greatest efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFalconWays, an innovative tool for optimizing flight plans to reduce kerosene consumption and CO2 emissions, was awarded the Aviation Week Laureate Award in November 2023.\n\nIn addition, Dassault Aviation has become a major corporate sponsor of the Maubuisson forest in the Val-d'Oise department of France.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Dynamic **Shaping the future**\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic 2023 Annual Report Dassault Aviation 17\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: A man walks past an aircraft in a hangar. The text \"18 Dassault Aviation 2023 Annual Report Dynamic\" is visible in the upper left corner of the image.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Proud of our model**\n\n**Operating in an unpredictable environment in which taking a very long‑term view is key, our fundamentals are solid. Our strength lies in a unique development model and very loyal customers. We owe our longevity to our ability to envision the future and adapt to new challenges.**\n\n### **Strategic mission**\n\nWe play a key part in France's national defense by supplying military aircraft, as well as by providing associated support. We have acquired strategic expertise in the design and management of a high-performance and reliable air combat system. Fighter aircraft and their accompanying operational systems constitute the cornerstones of security and deterrence in the face of significant threats.\n\nDassault Aviation manufactures conventional combat systems. The export of military hardware is the exclusive prerogative of the French government, and is subject to a stringent system of regulatory controls.\n\n### **Dual expertise: civil and military**\n\nOur dual civil-military expertise means that we can count on markets with different business cycles, thus reducing our exposure to fluctuating economic conditions. Our civil and military jet aircraft are designed in the same department and manufactured in the same plants. The state-of-the-art technology developed for military use also benefits our civil aviation business, which in turn generates innovations in terms of production and certification.\n\n### **Governance and family values**\n\nDassault Aviation is the only aerospace group in the world that is still owned by the family of its founder, Marcel Dassault. This unwavering backing from our main shareholder ensures the stability of our management team: Eric Trappier is only the fifth CEO in a century. This enables us to take a long-term view, which is a major asset in aviation where cycles stretch over decades: an aircraft may well stay in production for 25 years and remain in service for 40 years or more.\n\nOur stability allows us to uphold the values that have driven Dassault Aviation's success: technical excellence and innovation; a passion for aeronautics; quick strategic decisions; adaptability in the face of change; the determination to meet objectives; efficient management and competitiveness; and a human resources policy designed to attract and retain top talent.\n\n### **Profit‑sharing**\n\nDassault Aviation takes a unique approach to sharing profits with its French employees, based on fair distribution: under special agreements, €170 million in profit-sharing and incentive payments were redistributed based on 2023 financial results. €266 million in dividends were proposed to our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024. Dassault Aviation pays the bulk of its taxes in France: 83% in 2023, which represented a contribution of some €539 million to the public purse.\n\nCivil and military aircraft, all produced by the same design office and in the same plants\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Shaping technological innovation**\n\n**As an industrial architect and systems integrator, it is vital to be able to develop and implement cutting‑edge technologies, and to harness data. Dassault Aviation possesses this rare ability, making it a pivotal player in aerospace R&D in France and Europe, in both civil and military aviation.**\n\n### **Substantial investments**\n\nOur commitment to innovation is evidenced by our R&D budget: €539 million in financed R&D and €483 million in self-financed R&D. Our current development projects include the Rafale F4 and Export standards, the FCAS, Falcon 10X, Falcon 8X Archange, Falcon 2000 Albatros and drones.\n\nDassault Aviation is the only major French aerospace company to make the prestigious *Leaders de l'innovation en France* list. Published in 2023 by *Les Echos* newspaper and Statista, this ranking recognizes innovation in products and processes, as well as companies' overall corporate commitment to innovation.\n\n### **Meeting environmental challenges**\n\nWe are determined that business aviation continue to be a key driver in the decarbonization of the aviation sector. Our aircraft are ideally suited to the incorporation of innovations that help reduce CO2 emissions. Our customers, most of whom are companies, are fully behind us in this approach. We are exploring a number of technological solutions, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which we regard as highly promising: over its life cycle, SAF emits 80% to 90% less CO2 than fossil kerosene. Our Falcons are already equipped to fly with SAF containing 50% non-fossil fuel.\n\n### **Civil aviation research in France**\n\nRight from the design stage and throughout their life cycle, we are actively reducing the environmental footprint of our aircraft. As part of France's civil aviation research council (Corac), we are actively involved in a series of technology maturation projects aimed at achieving sustainability in aviation.\n\n### **European cooperation**\n\nSince 2008, the Clean Sky 1 and 2 programs have enabled us to collaborate with some twenty major partners in seven European countries. We are continuing with our efforts in this area by heading up the Clean Aviation program's Concerto project.\n\nSesar, a European joint-undertaking devoted to improving air traffic management, has contributed to the development of our FalconEye system, which provides safe access to all airports in poor weather conditions, including those with limited technical resources.\n\n### **Artificial intelligence (AI)**\n\nWe are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to enhance the operational performance of aviation, with a view to harnessing the full potential of the concept of collaborative combat. Our teams are involved in proof-of-concept research with academics and leading companies in the field.\n\n€483 million in self‑financed R&D expenditures\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nPULL AND TURN\n\nZAM\n\nCOCKPIT LIGHTS\n\n30\n\nVINXS-20UN-TTSL-HTC?\n\n1000 3000\n\nso\n\nEMERG GEAR-\n\n21\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/1 description: This image shows two fighter jets in a simulated environment.

We add value through our ability to manage, coordinate and guarantee the ultimate efficacy of the systems delivered by the projects we lead.\n\nGuarantor of the system's underlying fundamentals and its development, we are responsible for assessing the technological challenges as well as the scope and sharing of tasks between partners.\n\n### **Design architect**\n\nOur approach to product design is focused on harnessing data. Deployed as part of combat bubbles, our future weapons systems need to enable humans to maintain their position at the helm of the decision-making process, while ensuring operational performance in the midst of high-intensity operations and in situations involving contested network conditions. This will be achieved by means of collaborative combat, automated systems based partly on AI, as well as adaptive and resilient system architectures.\n\n### **Rafale road map**\n\nThe Rafale continues to surge ahead thanks to a combination of technological advances and user feedback. Its F3-R standard, launched in 2014, entered service in December 2019. The F4 standard, with its focus on connectivity and enhanced payloads, will be validated in 2027. The launch of the planned F5 standard, designed for collaborative combat, is currently underway.\n\n### **New Falcons**\n\nThe Falcon 6X, launched in 2018, received joint certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in August 2023.\n\nThe Falcon 10X was unveiled in May 2021. Delivery of the first aircraft will begin in 2027, following revision of the timetable.\n\n### **Special‑mission Falcons**\n\nThe Falcon 10X is one of the two aircraft selected by the French defense procurement agency (DGA) in December 2022 for inclusion in a system design project aimed at developing a future maritime patrol aircraft to replace the ATL2.\n\nThe contract for the maritime surveillance Falcon Albatros (AVSIMAR) was officially announced in December 2020.\n\nThe Archange airborne strategic intelligence program was launched in December 2019. It will be based on the Falcon 8X jet, equipped with electronic warfare systems designed by Thales.\n\n### **Cooperation on demonstrators**\n\nThe nEUROn is the first stealth combat drone (UCAV) to date to be developed as part of a joint European program. Dassault Aviation is the lead partner in this program and the Rafale F5's combat drone will be developed on the basis of this demonstrator.\n\nThe Future Combat Air System (FCAS) Phase 1B contract for R&T and overall flying demonstrator design commenced in March 2023. As prime contractor and architect of the New Generation Fighter NGF (Pillar 1), Dassault Aviation has brought together the manufacturing teams from all three partner countries at its facility in Saint-Cloud.\n\nForesight from experience, leadership through expertise\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Digital technology driving innovation and our development strategy**\n\n**Our capabilities as a system architect draw on major digital technologies, ranging from 3D creation to big data. For more than forty years, we have been among the pioneers in this industrial revolution.**\n\n### **Digital DNA**\n\nEver since the revolutionary advent of 3D modeling, we have been investing in digital innovations. This was the crucible that forged Dassault Systèmes, our long-standing partner. Our links with the world leader in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions provide us with the expertise and methods needed to adapt these powerful technologies to our industrial activities. The new tools we are deploying also enhance our ability to look ahead and take a comprehensive view – from design through production, and right down to support and the user experience.\n\n### **3DExperience platform**\n\nIn 2018, the decision was made to transition to 3DExperience, Dassault Systèmes' unified platform, which has replaced all existing PLM solutions used in our civil and military aircraft programs. The development of the new Falcon and future combat aircraft is taking place using this platform.\n\n### **Data sovereignty**\n\nWe are currently using the 3DExperience platform on Dassault Systèmes' sovereign cloud as part of the European FCAS program, as well as to support the operational readiness of aircraft operated by the French armed forces. Our partnership with Dassault Systèmes is the first collaborative engineering solution designed specifically to meet the cyber requirements of defense programs. This represents a significant step towards the creation of a sovereign European cloud.\n\n### **Collaborative system engineering**\n\nThis approach involves using a shared digital model to coordinate everybody involved in the development of large airborne systems. Implemented as part of the ATL2 modernization project, this framework is currently being applied as part of the FCAS/NGF collaborative project and is being used for our new programs. The system digital model allows security and data sovereignty considerations to be incorporated very early in the process.\n\n### **Analysis, decision‑making and big data**\n\nBig data is used to optimize support for our civil and military customers. It enables the deployment of management, analysis and decision-making tools, based on strictly controlled and sovereign shared data. The digital twin of each aircraft replicates the various phases of its life cycle. This enables us to engage in predictive maintenance to improve the effectiveness of the support we provide and to maximize fleet availability.\n\nDesign, manufacture, support: towards a comprehensive digital vision\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nX\n\nROOT\n\n55528BE080055\n\nT\n\nen iup zepéig zonishe\n\n226T\n\n2000\n\nbadbee\n\nnoitexit 6119tqanl\n\n19 12 555288E0800JS\n\nel abst2 90 6 299tnom\n\n6j9b troz\n\n10 6 כוסqq61 169\n\nto atelit 2.1 = inim)\n\n(atelit 2. = xsm\n\n129 ziv al sup 19ítireν\n\nimbo 1956 19\n\nziv eb ståt sl\n\n96 2GLL906 9\n\n66\n\n• Aşe dine je conbje\n\nebis'l é supilqqs\n\nE9l91922691x3upitixi\n\n٢٢٣٥+S=29912 T\n\nSSS28BE08001ST\n\n55528BE080045Г\n\n5552808001\n\n28000\n\nMS10080388488\n\n25\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Dassault Aviation** 2023 Annual ReportDynamic\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Gearing up for the future**\n\n**Our ongoing efforts to enhance both our manufacturing processes and our production ecosystem are key to achieving the high levels of quality and competitiveness demanded by the global market.

The digital twin approach, which compares the actual aircraft's performance to its digital model, further increases our forecasting capabilities, thus improving aircraft availability.\n\n### **Custom‑tailored military support**\n\nOur optimized support solutions for military aircraft guarantee fleet availability over the long term. In France, most of our aircraft are covered by vertically-integrated maintenance contracts, with minimum terms of ten years. Under these agreements, we are responsible for providing equipment and systems to the French Air and Space Force; similar arrangements are in place for our export customers. Examples in France include the Ravel contract for the Rafale (signed in 2019), the Océan contract for the ATL2 (2020), the Balzac contract for the Mirage 2000 (2021) and the Alpha Care contract for the Alpha Jet (2023).\n\nWe provide our customers with top-quality training for pilots and maintenance technicians, most of which takes place at our Conversion Training Center (CTC) in Mérignac.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Supporting the Falcon Family**\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that our customers are able to conduct their missions safely and with peace of mind.\n\nWe provide services that are tailored to each customer' specific needs.

It stands at EUR 38.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 (295 aircraft - 141 Rafale Export, 70 Rafale France and 84 Falcon). Post-closing of the 2023 financial statements, the backlog increased with the entry into force in January 2024 of the third batch of 18 Rafale of the Indonesian contract. A total of 495 Rafale have thus been ordered since the beginning of the program.** \n\n**Certification of the Falcon 6X by EASA and FAA (type certificate) has been approved on August 22nd, 2023, the entry into service of the aircraft including the application of post certification upgrades happened on November 30th 2023. The first delivery took place in February 2024.** \n\n**13 Rafale and 26 Falcon were delivered, versus a guidance of 15 and 35, due to supply chain issues and the delayed entry into service of Falcon 6X.**\n\n**Group's Revenues for this year stood at EUR 4.8 billion, leading to an adjusted EBIT of EUR 349 million and a record breaking adjusted net result of EUR 886 million, representing 18.5% of net sales.**\n\nIn 2023, the international context deteriorated, marked by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. France adopted an ambitious Military Procurement Law (Loi de Programmation Militaire - LPM), which allocates a budget of EUR 413 billion for the 2024-2030 period (representing an increase of 40% compared to the previous LPM). For Dassault Aviation, the LPM provides for the ongoing deliveries of the Rafale program fourth batch, the coming into force of the 42 aircraft of the fifth batch (20 of which are to be delivered from 2027 to 2030), the completion by 2027 of the Rafale Standard F4, the negotiation and beginning of Rafale Standard F5 which should come along with the development of a combat drone.\n\nSupply chain issues that arose during the Covid crisis continue to have a severe impact on subcontractors in the aviation industry, which are not always able to deliver the required quality or meet deadlines. Certain supplier weaknesses, coupled with capacity shortages, mainly in aerostructure, resulted for the Group in delays in production start-ups. While these risks will continue to weigh on the Group's business in 2024, Dassault Aviation has implemented a centralized steering plan to introduce corrective measures, provide the necessary support to certain sub-contractors and develop \"Make in India.\"\n\nThe Paris Le Bourget Air Show was held in June 2023. This trade show allowed Dassault Aviation to once again showcase the efforts it has undertaken to decarbonize its processes and products, and those that it will continue to pursue in the years to come. The Group is committed to its decarbonization: the Falcon aircraft are certified to fly with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends with kerosene up to 50%. Today's available alternative fuels (SAF) offer a carbon emission reduction's rate in the range of 80% to 90% compared to conventional kerosene. All Dassault Aviation flights, including those in the United States, are using 30% SAF blends which are the only ones available on the market today. 413 flights have been operated in 2023 by Dassault Aviation with 30% SAF blends (vs. 179 in 2022). Aircraft models currently under production will be compatible with 100% SAF blends by 2030 (Falcon 10X natively).\n\nIn the military sector, 2023 saw:\n\n- the order by France for 42 Rafale placed in December 2023 under the country's new Military Procurement Law which was adopted in July 2023,\n- the addition to the backlog of the second batch of 18 Rafale under the Indonesian contract (followed on January 8, 2024 by the entry into force of a third batch of 18 aircraft),\n- the delivery of 11 Rafale to France,\n- the delivery of 2 new Rafale to Greece, as well as 6 pre-owned Rafale,\n- the continuation of development work on the Rafale F4 standard and the FCAS, for which Dassault Aviation is leader for the NGF demonstrator,\n- the continuation of work on the Eurodrone contract. Dassault Aviation is responsible in particular for flight controls and mission communications as a sub-contractor,\n- in the field of military support, the Group has met the availability commitments of its operational maintenance contracts (Ravel for the Rafale, Ocean for the ATL2 and Balzac for the Mirage 2000),\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nand participated in \"High Intensity\" warfare exercises with the French forces. At the end of December, a new verticalized maintenance contract was notified: \"Alphacare\" for the Alpha Jet. Moreover, support for fleets in service for Export customers continued as close as possible to operations.\n\nIn the civil aviation segment, 23 Falcon were ordered and 26 Falcon were delivered in 2023, compared with a guidance of 35.\n\nThe year also saw:\n\n- the continuation of development efforts on the Falcon 6X and 10X:\n\t- o The Falcon 6X was certified on August 22, 2023 and entered into service on November 30, 2023. Prospection has been stepped up, notably thanks to a demonstration aircraft. The flights operated allowed the first customers to confirm the cabin's very high level of comfort. The ramp up of production also continued, in a challenging supply chain context,\n\t- o the first Falcon 10X (development aircraft) is currently being built. The program schedule has been adjusted and the first deliveries are scheduled for 2027.\n- the expansion of the network of service centers, notably with the opening of the service center in Dubai (to replace the previous center).\n\nSocial and environmental responsibility was reflected in 2023 through:\n\n- the Company's commitment to the environment and to the decarbonization of its Falcon aircraft, in particular with:\n\t- o significant results for the Parent Company's energy saving plan which was launched at the end of 2022: -10.4% of energy consumption per hour worked,\n\t- o the ramp-up of the \"SAF plan\" which set an ambitious target for the use of SAF for its internal flights (413 flights operated with \"30% SAF\" blends in 2023 compared with 179 in 2022),\n\t- o the entry into service of the flight plan optimization tool FalconWays.\n- a major recruitment drive and an attractive employment model in which true to the ideals of Serge and Marcel Dassault – value sharing is a core part of its DNA with notably:\n\t- o almost 2,000 new hires, including 200 apprentices, in a tight labor market,\n\t- o based on the 2023 profits, profit-sharing and incentives reached EUR 170 million (for employees of the Group's French companies , including the corresponding employer's tax) compared with the minimum legal profit-sharing of EUR 8 million.\n\nThe Board of Directors would like to congratulate all the Group's employees for the past year's success and express its confidence in achieving the objectives for the coming year\"\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.

Definition of alternative performance indicators**\n\nTo reflect the Group's actual economic performance, and for monitoring and comparability reasons, the Group presents an income statement adjusted with the following elements:\n\n- gains and losses resulting from the exercise of hedging instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS standards. This income, presented as financial income in the consolidated financial statements, is reclassified as net sales and thus as operating income in the adjusted income statement,\n- the valuation of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting, by neutralizing the change in fair value of these instruments (the Group considering that gains or losses on hedging should only impact income as commercial flows occur), with the exception of derivatives allocated to hedge balance sheet positions whose change in fair value is presented as operating income,\n- amortization of assets valued as part of the purchase price allocation (business combinations), known as \"PPA\",\n- adjustments made by Thales in its financial reporting.\n\nThe Group also presents the \"available cash\" indicator, which reflects the amount of the Group's total liquidities, net of financial debt. It covers the following balance sheet items:\n\n- cash and cash equivalents,\n- other current financial assets,\n- financial debt, excluding lease liabilities.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 9).\n\nOnly consolidated financial statements are audited by statutory auditors.\n\nAdjusted financial data are subject to the verification procedures applicable to all information provided in the annual report.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.3.

Order intake**\n\n**2023 order intake** was **EUR 8,253 million** versus EUR 20,954 million in 2022. **Export** order intake represented **64%**.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|                    | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Defense            | 6,524 | 17,510 | 9,165  |\n| Defense Export     | 3,583 | 15,657 | 6,173  |\n| Defense France     | 2,941 | 1,853  | 2,992  |\n| Falcon             | 1,729 | 3,444  | 2,915  |\n| Total order intake | 8,253 | 20,954 | 12,080 |\n| % Export           | 64%   | 90%    | 74%    |\n\nThe order intake is composed entirely of firm orders.\n\n### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **Defense order intake** totaled **EUR 6,524 million**, compared with EUR 17,510 million in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense Export** share amounted **EUR 3,583 million** in 2023, versus EUR 15,657 million in 2022. In 2022, 92 Rafale were ordered (80 by the United Arab Emirates, 6 by Greece and 6 by Indonesia) compared to 18 Rafale ordered by Indonesia in 2023.\n\nThe **Defense France** share amounted to **EUR 2,941 million** in 2023, compared with EUR 1,853 million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the order for Batch 5 of 42 Rafale (in 2022, the order relating to Phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator was recorded).\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, **23 Falcon orders** were recorded, compared with 64 in 2022. Order intake totaled **EUR 1,729 million** versus EUR 3,444 million in 2022. This decrease is mainly due to the decline in the number of Falcon ordered (23 vs. 64 in 2022).\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.5. Adjusted net sales**\n\nNet sales for 2023 were **EUR 4,801 million** versus EUR 6,929 million in 2022. **Export** represented **68%**.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|                             | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Defense                     | 2,980 | 4,825 | 5,281 |\n| Defense Export              | 1,512 | 3,616 | 4,549 |\n| Defense France              | 1,468 | 1,209 | 732   |\n| Falcon                      | 1,821 | 2,104 | 1,952 |\n| Total adjusted net<br>sales | 4,801 | 6,929 | 7,233 |\n| % Export                    | 68%   | 82%   | 89%   |\n\n#### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **13 Rafale (11 France and 2 Export)** were delivered, compared with the guidance of 15. 14 Rafale (13 Export and 1 France) were delivered in 2022.\n\n**Defense net sales** in 2023 were **EUR 2,980 million** versus EUR 4,825 million in 2022. The **Defense Export share** was **EUR 1,512 million** versus EUR 3,616 million in 2022. This decrease is largely due to the delivery of 2 Export Rafale, whereas 13 Export Rafale were delivered in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense France** share was **EUR 1,468 million** versus EUR 1,209 million in 2022. Defense France 2023 net sales notably included the delivery of 11 Rafale versus 1 Rafale in 2022.\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\n**26 Falcon were delivered in 2023**, compared with the guidance of 35, versus 32 deliveries in 2022.\n\n**Falcon net sales** for 2023 were **EUR 1,821 million** versus EUR 2,104 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the number of Falcon aircraft delivered (26 vs. 32).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe book-to-bill ratio of the Group (order intake/net sales) is 1.72 for 2023.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.6. Backlog**\n\nThe consolidated backlog as of December 31, 2023 (determined in accordance with IFRS 15) was **EUR 38,508 million**, versus EUR 35,008 million as of December 31, 2022. Change in the backlog is as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n| As of December 31 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Defense           | 33,862 | 30,318 | 17,633 |\n| Defense Export    | 23,986 | 21,915 | 9,874  |\n| Defense France    | 9,876  | 8,403  | 7,759  |\n| Falcon            | 4,646  | 4,690  | 3,129  |\n| Total backlog     | 38,508 | 35,008 | 20,762 |\n| % Export          | 71%    | 72%    | 58%    |\n\nThe backlog as of December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\n\n- **Defense Export**: **EUR 23,986 million** versus EUR 21,915 million as of December 31, 2022. This figure notably includes 141 new Rafale in 2023, compared with 125 new Rafale and 6 pre-owned Rafale in the Defense Export backlog as of December 31, 2022,\n- **Defense France**: **EUR 9,876 million** versus EUR 8,403 million as of December 31, 2022. This figure mainly comprises 70 Rafale (vs. 39 at the end of December 2022), the support contracts for the Rafale (Ravel), Mirage 2000 (Balzac), ATL2 (Ocean) and the Alpha Jet (Alphacare), the Rafale F4 standard and the order for phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator.\n- **Falcon** (including the Albatros and Archange mission aircraft): **EUR 4,646 million** versus EUR 4,690 million as of December 31, 2022. It includes notably 84 Falcon, compared with 87 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAdditional information on the backlog can be found in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **1.1.7. Adjusted results**\n\n### **Adjusted operating income**\n\n**Adjusted operating income** for 2023 was **EUR 349 million**, compared with EUR 572 million in 2022.\n\nResearch and development costs totaled EUR 483 million in 2023 and accounted for 10.1% of net sales, compared with EUR 572 million and 8.3% of net sales in 2022. These amounts reflect the self-funded R&D effort focused on the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X programs.\n\nThe **adjusted operating margin** stood at **7.3%** compared to 8.3% in 2022, representing a 1.0 point decrease, notably due to the 1.8 point increase in the weight of research and development expenditure.\n\nThe foreign exchange hedging rate was USD 1.20/EUR in 2023, vs. USD 1.19/EUR in 2022.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Adjusted financial income**\n\n**2023 adjusted financial income** was EUR 210 million compared to EUR 11 million in 2022. This strong increase was due to financial income generated by the Group's cash position in a context of favorable interest rates.\n\n#### **Adjusted net income**\n\n**Adjusted net income** for 2023 was EUR **886 million** vs. EUR 830 million in 2022, increasing by 6.7 %. Thales' contribution to the Group's net income was EUR 453 million, versus EUR 386 million in 2022.\n\nAs a result, **adjusted net margin** was **18.5%** in 2023, versus 12.0% in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the higher net financial income and contribution from Thales.\n\nAdjusted net income per share in 2023 was **EUR 10.95** vs. EUR 9.99 in 2022.\n\n#### **1.1.8. Consolidated key figures under IFRS**\n\n**Consolidated operating income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated operating income** for 2023 was **EUR 349 million** vs. EUR 591 million in 2022.\n\nR&D costs totaled EUR 483 million in 2023 and accounted for 10.1% of consolidated net sales (EUR 4,805 million), compared to EUR 572 million and 8.2% of consolidated net sales in 2022. These amounts reflect the self-funded R&D effort focused on the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X programs.\n\nThe **consolidated operating margin** was **7.3%** compared to 8.5% in 2022.\n\n#### **Consolidated financial income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated net financial income** for 2023 was **EUR 212 million** vs. EUR -12 million in 2022. This strong increase was due to financial income generated by the Group's cash position in a context of favorable interest rates.\n\n#### **Consolidated net income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated net income** for 2023 was **EUR 693 million,** compared with EUR 716 million in 2022. Thales' contribution to the Group's net income was EUR 259 million, versus EUR 275 million in 2022.\n\nAs a result, **consolidated net margin** was **14.4%** in 2023, as against 10.3% in 2022.\n\n**Consolidated net income per share** for 2023 was **EUR 8.57** compared with EUR 8.62 in 2022.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.9. Value Sharing**\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend distribution, in 2024, of EUR 3.37 per share, **EUR 266 million in aggregate**, representing a payout of 30%. The Board of Directors of March 5th, 2024, has decided to cancel 1,850,554 shares. The dividend per share is calculated based on the number of shares as of December 31, 2023, netted of the number of those shares canceled.\n\nFor 2023, the Group will pay **EUR 170 million** in employee profit-sharing and incentives, including 20% employer's corresponding tax, whereas the application of the legal formula would have resulted in a EUR 8 million payment (including the employer's corresponding tax).\n\nDividends per share over the five last years are provided in Note 32 to the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\n### **1.1.10. Financial reporting**\n\nIFRS 8 \"Operating Segments\" requires the presentation of information per segment according to internal management criteria.\n\nThe entire activity of the Dassault Aviation Group relates to the aerospace domain. Internal reporting to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and to the Chief Operating Officer, used for strategy and decision-making, does not include a performance analysis under IFRS 8 at a lower level then this sector.\n\n### **1.2. Financial structure**\n\n### **1.2.1. Available cash**\n\nThe Group uses a specific indicator called \"Available cash\", which reflects the amount of total cash available to the Group, net of financial debts. It includes the following balance sheet items: cash and cash equivalents, current financial assets and financial debt, excluding lease liabilities. The calculation of this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 9 of the December 31, 2023, consolidated financial statements).\n\n**The Group's available cash** stands at **EUR 7,294 million**, versus EUR 9,529 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in available cash in 2023 was mainly due to the increase in work-in-progress (execution of military contracts, ramp-up of the Falcon 6X), share buybacks and acquisition of the additional stake in Thales.\n\n#### **1.2.2. Consolidated balance sheet**\n\nTotal equity stood at EUR 5,742 million as of December 31, 2023 compared with EUR 6,006 million as of December 31, 2022. This amount has been impacted by the share buyback.\n\nBorrowings and financial debt stood at EUR 262 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR 234 million as of December 31, 2022. Borrowings and financial debt include locked-in employees' profitsharing funds, for EUR 78 million, and lease liabilities, for EUR 184 million.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nInventories and work-in-progress rose to EUR 5,258 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR 3,922 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase was due to the execution of military contracts and the ramp-up of the Falcon 6X.\n\nAdvances and progress payments received on orders, net of advances and progress payments paid decreased by EUR 137 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease relating to the retrocession of Rafale Export downpayments received at the end of 2022 to our co-contractors was almost entirely offset by advances received, notably for the Rafale contracts in Indonesia and Egypt.\n\nDerivative financial instruments had a market value of EUR 29 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR -88 million as of December 31, 2022, reflecting an improvement in the hedging portfolio rate.\n\n### **1.3.

Moreover, post-closing of the 2023 financial statements, an additional 18 Rafale entered into force on January 8, 2024 (they are therefore not included in the 2023 order intake, nor in the backlog as of December 31, 2023), taking the total ordered by Indonesia to 42 Rafale,\n- the choice of the Rafale Marine by the Indian government, which announced in July 2023 that it had selected the aircraft to equip the Indian Navy with 26 Rafale,\n- continuing prospection.\n\nMoreover, the Group continued to fulfill its export contract, with notably:\n\n- the delivery to Greece of 2 new Rafale and 6 pre-owned Rafale,\n- support for the delivery by France to Croatia of the first 4 pre-owned Rafale.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n- the preparation for the entry into service of the Falcon 6X: adaptation of the global network of maintenance centers, supply of spare parts and tools, theory training for mechanics and crew with CAE and practical training at Dassault Aviation in Mérignac,\n- stabilization of the WorldWideSpares solution,\n- two 6C-checks (36 years) on the Falcon 900B from the ET 60 under the maintenance contract for the French government's Falcon fleet, notified in September 2022 for seven years; the Group was congratulated by the government on its first year of operations at the Villacoublay air base,\n- renewal of the Hellenic Air Force's Falcon 7X support contract.\n\n### **1.5.3. Research and development**\n\nIn 2023, most of our research and development was focused on the development of the Falcon 10X, the finalization of the development and certification of the Falcon 6X, as well as the development of the Rafale, particularly its future standards, and the NGF demonstrator.\n\nThe Group is also keen to improve existing products and pave the way for future products, continually striving to reduce environmental impacts while offering its customers increasing levels of service and efficiency with unparalleled safety.\n\nSince 2008, Dassault Aviation has been a member of CORAC (COnseil pour la Recherche Aéronautique Civile – the French Civil Aviation Research Council), under the aegis of which leading manufacturers have drafted plans as part of the \"France 2030\" investment plan, which replaces the \"France Relance\" recovery plan and are preparing the national road map for 2024-2029.\n\nDassault Aviation is also involved in the last years of the European \"Clean Sky 2\" project and now the \"Clean Aviation\" program. Dassault Aviation is coordinating a project on the technical principles of requirements and how to comply with the future regulations needed to certify disruptive aircraft with a view to decarbonizing air transport.\n\nWithin these European and national frameworks, teams are actively working on developing technologies to improve environmental performance. In addition, Dassault Aviation is committed to working with regional ecosystems.\n\nMore specifically, this research and innovation work includes technological development projects and concepts such as:\n\n- reducing the weight of primary structures with new materials and processes (new metal alloys, composites),\n- reducing the weight of certain equipment and additional components (metal additive manufacturing, thermoplastics),\n- maturing electric de-icing technologies,\n- exploring how the flight controls can control a wing which is more elongated and therefore more efficient, but also more flexible and more prone to flutter,\n- the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), which must be compatible with fuel systems and engines when blended with conventional kerosene at high percentage levels, with a view to achieving 100% SAF operation in the medium term by the middle of the decade,\n- optimized flight planning and management to reduce fuel consumption, and therefore CO<sup>2</sup> (an initial flight app has been launched under the commercial name FalconWays) and optimized take-off and landing trajectories to reduce external noise,\n- research into concepts and technologies for the reduction of noise at source, which must not increase aircraft mass and/or aerodynamic drag,\n- reduction of pilot workload as part of this optimization process, and development of protective features for piloting systems,\n- extension of the capacity of the synthetic vision system to increase the operational capacity of the Falcon in severe weather conditions,\n- optimization of the cabin air system to maximize passenger comfort and reduce health risks.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n Research into alternative solutions following the publication by Europe of its hazardous substances list (REACH)\n\nIn addition, the Group continues to make significant efforts to increase the efficiency, from the design stage, of its production processes and maintenance services by using the tools offered by digital technology:\n\n- co-engineering methods are tested and implemented to ensure the best trade-offs between design, production and support,\n- optimization of the entire testing process (new types of instrumentation, processing and data analysis) and hybridization of simulation models and test data reduce the number of development flight tests and the processing cycle for any adjustments,\n- advances in digital technology help demonstrate why the aircraft meets the certification criteria,\n- optimizing the production cycle involves research into eco-design, new materials, additive manufacturing and waste recycling, and finding alternative solutions for treating and protecting parts from corrosion, such as the removal of chromates and baths in the processes,\n- the development of algorithms for automated fleet data processing should increase predictive maintenance capabilities.\n\nThe Group has stepped up scientific and industrial collaboration on methods and tools for the development, validation, verification and qualification of reliable artificial intelligence (AI) functions, with the aim of improving system efficiency and productivity via adapted and secure AI processes that use sensitive information. In particular, the Group is exploring its contribution to improving the efficiency of future flight operations to take full advantage of the collaborative combat concept. The teams are working on proofs of concept with academics and innovative companies in the field.\n\nTo strike a balance between short-cycle innovations and technological developments over the long term, work is focused on architectures that can effectively integrate changes and disruptions, while meeting the highest safety requirements.\n\nWith the InnovLab process we are continuing our rapid-application proof of concept (feasibility) demonstrations. Several of them have been launched as part of the network-based innovation process that networks creative laboratory initiatives to foster their collaborative work. Particular attention is paid to relationships with a dynamic start-up ecosystem.\n\nWork is continuing at the MOLIERE joint research laboratory with two universities on innovative functional materials for aviation. Initial results are promising and additional support has been received from the AID (Agence d'Innovation de Défense – French Defense Innovation Agency) since early 2022.\n\n### **1.5.4. \"Leading Our Future\"**\n\n\"Leading Our Future\" is focused on preparing the Group's future in an increasingly unpredictable and competitive environment. The main objective is improving competitiveness and flexibility.\n\nTo do so, four areas for action have been introduced since 2017:\n\n- Human capital, organization, methods,\n- Production facilities and innovation,\n- Digital solutions to drive operational performance,\n- Program coordination.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Employee recruitment, training and guidance\n- The consolidation of our digital platforms:\n\t- o Widespread use of the 3DExpérienceTM platform for program coordination, extension of the design office, completion, technical collaboration with our suppliers and aggregation of technical data (for the industrial definition and operation of our aircraft),\n\t- o Single database for planning and managing purchasing, production and support flows through SAP,\n\t- o Big data: data processing to provide better support to our military and civil customers,\n\t- o Sovereign Cloud with the 3DExperienceTM Cloud solution as part of our aircraft maintenance programs and the European FCAS program,\n\t- o Data Act: protection of our intellectual property and securing cyber risks with the European Commission.\n- Modernisation of industrial infrastructure\n\t- o Istres: delivery of the building designed to house the Falcon 10X simulator,\n\t- o Mérignac: adaptation of building G for special projects and of building K to house the Falcon 10X,\n\t- o Martignas: delivery of the building for assembly of the Falcon 10X wingbox,\n\t- o Cergy: delivery of the building postponed to 2024.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue to work on the following catalysts for action:\n\n- Human capital, organization, methods, training and guidance,\n- Digital solutions to drive operational performance,\n- Programs and innovation,\n- Make in India.\n\n### **1.5.5. Total quality**\n\nThe objective of the Dassault Aviation's total quality is to ensure right from the start that the quality of our products and services fully meets the expectations of our customers.\n\nDelivering quality products and services also contributes to the safety and airworthiness of our aircraft.\n\nThe management of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and supervision of the Company's operations are also part of the total quality department's role.\n\nObjectives are shared with all Dassault Aviation employees. Achieving them is possible because people at the company embody the culture of quality, and because our efficient management and quality assurance system is universally applied.\n\nThanks to its integrated management system, Dassault Aviation holds the following certification:\n\n- ISO 9001, EN 9100 and AQAP 2110, for the development, production and maintenance of our products and services,\n- ISO 14001, for the environment.\n\nThe Group's organization has also allowed it to hold design, production and maintenance airworthiness certifications for its civil and military aircraft. These certifications, which were issued by the main airworthiness authorities, are a recognition of Dassault Aviation's ability to design, produce and maintain civil and military aircraft in compliance with the strictest airworthiness requirements.\n\nWeaknesses at some of our suppliers will continue to remain a focus in 2024. For this reason, we will continue our major efforts to monitor and support them. With particular attention paid to maintaining skills and mastering manufacturing processes.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main themes for the Total Quality policy in 2024 remain:\n\n- Maintaining Falcon and military customer satisfaction at the top of industry rankings to guarantee sustainable long-term sales,\n- Drawing on human capital to reinforce our expertise and our commitment to serving industrial performance,\n- Continuing to use data to be efficient in our quality assurance and continuous improvement plans,\n- Developing quality assurance at our suppliers to reinforce our \"right first time\" approach.\n\nThe main themes of the CSR policy in 2024 are:\n\n- Decarbonization, with the use of alternative fuel (SAF),\n- Application of our environmental sobriety plan to all our industrial and tertiary sites,\n- The new talent recruitment and support plan (same level of recruitment than in 2023).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2. RISK FACTORS**\n\nThis chapter describes the main risks to which the Dassault Aviation Group is exposed. Some of the risks listed are covered in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration (\"NFPD\") in Chapter 4 of this report.\n\nThe Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties which may affect its activities, reputation or ability to achieve its objectives.\n\nThese various factors are taken into account using a comprehensive risk management system in order to:\n\n- continually identify the sources of risk at the earliest possible opportunity so that the consequences can be better managed,\n- map the risks each year across all of the Group's functions, under the aegis of the Corporate Risk Committee.\n\nThe risks described are the most significant net risks, categorized by residual importance (high/medium/low) following measures to mitigate them. For each risk, its impact is combined with its probability of occurrence or its short/medium/long-term nature.\n\n| Exposure to risk | Identified Risk                                                   | Risk Category                            |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| High             | o Dependence on the supply chain                                  | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Program management                                              | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Cyber risks for IT systems                                      | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Security risks                                                  | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Global economic and geopolitical environment                    | Economic and Market risks                |\n| Medium           | o Markets                                                         | Economic and Market risks                |\n|                  | o Risks related to personnel                                      | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Environmental risks                                             | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Corporate social responsibility                                 | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Protection of intellectual property                             | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Market (exchange rate risk)                                     | Financial and market risks               |\n| Low              | o Implementation of Make In India                                 | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Compliance                                                      | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Financial (liquidity and treasury; loans and<br>counterparties) | Financial and market risks               |\n|                  | o Inadequate coverage                                             | Insurance                                |\n\n### **Summary of material risks**\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2.1. Economic and market risks**\n\n### **2.1.1. Market risks**\n\nOn the civil market, the slowdown seen at the end of 2022 was confirmed in 2023, exacerbated by increased energy and credit costs, as well as by an international context marked by a combination of uncertainties.\n\nIn addition, some entities in the maintenance network in Europe were faced with the loss of Russian customers since 2022 and a stagnating fleet in this region. In the United States, the Group continued to develop its current operations against an extremely competitive backdrop.\n\nCompetitors continue to benefit from favorable economic factors and flexibility due to their location in the dollar zone.\n\nTo address this, Dassault Aviation is pursuing its efforts to innovate and expand its Falcon range, as well as streamline production and reduce costs.\n\nFurthermore, mindful of its customers' carbon footprint, the Group is fully engaged with the industry's commitments to the environmental transition, following the Paris Agreement on carbon neutrality by 2050. Dassault Aviation's strategy includes the use of sustainable alternative fuels, for which production and the distribution network are expanding. In the short term, it continues studies to optimize aircraft already in operation and to seek innovation solutions for its projects. For the medium term, Dassault Aviation takes into account the tightening of French and European environmental regulations relating to climate change (the measures taken are detailed in Section 4.7). This complex regulatory environment could potentially lead to risks of competitiveness and distortion of competition.\n\nIn the defense sector, the export situation is benefiting from the geopolitical context. The search for Rafale contracts remains an ongoing challenge and the launch of demonstrators remains essential for future programs.\n\n### **2.1.2. Risks related to the global economic and geopolitical environment**\n\nThe nature of the Group's business exposes it to risks related to the uncertainties and volatility of the global economy, as well as political instability.\n\nThe international context was once again shaped by war in Ukraine and more recently by the conflict in the Middle-East, as well as the accompanying geopolitical instability. Should this conflict spread to the Gulf, it could have significant consequences for political equilibrium in the Middle East, as well as for global growth and energy prices.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, supplies in the aviation sector remain under significant pressure.\n\nThe Group generates a significant part of its business from government customers, and particularly from defense contracts. Public spending on these types of contracts depends on political and economic factors, which are likely to influence opportunities.\n\nIn the field of business aviation, customers are sensitive to the global economic situation and their financing capacity may depend on it.\n\n### **2.2. Operational risks**\n\n### **2.2.1. Risks of dependence on the Supply Chain**\n\nThe contribution of suppliers makes up a significant part of Dassault Aviation's products. As a result, supplier performance (price, quality and lead time) contributes to the Group's performance, and the failure of a supplier could jeopardize its programs and deliveries.\n\nAs production depends on an adequate supply for the production lines, any instability or supplier default could lead to significant disruption, delays, or even production line shutdowns.\n\nIn 2023, the structural and financial consequences of the various crises were acutely felt by suppliers faced with the recovery of the sector and capacity saturation, leading to severe pressure on supplies. As this situation has an impact on the development and production of its aircraft, the Group strives to limit these negative impacts by monitoring its suppliers' production more closely.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeliveries in 2023 were adversely affected by supply chain disruptions. Supplier defaults, coupled with capacity shortages, mainly in aerostructure, resulted in delays in production start-ups.\n\nAdded to this were efforts to decarbonize and the increasing risk of cyber attacks. These factors notably weaken the supply chain.\n\nThere are different kinds of supplier risks:\n\n- structural risks (financial soundness or changes in equity ownership),\n- operational risks (technical failures, quality issues, supply disruptions, delivery delays, cyberattacks, etc.),\n- compliance risks (legal, regulatory, etc.) and export bans,\n- global risks (geopolitical, natural disasters, pandemics, etc.).\n\nFaced with these risks, the Group has set up a \"Watch Tower\" for its suppliers to improve monitoring and Supplier Risk Committees to assess appropriate preventative and corrective measures, to meet the needs of the production chains.\n\nThe risk to our supplies and production management is still present in 2024. We have adapted our organization and implemented a centralized steering plan to introduce corrective measures, provide the necessary support to certain sub-contractors and develop \"Make in India.*\"*\n\n### **2.2.2. Risks related to program management**\n\nThe timescales required for the development and production of the Group's products, the complexity of aviation technology, flight safety requirements and the existence of long-term contractual obligations expose the programs to risks that it is essential to manage in order to meet schedules and customer commitments and thus protect net sales.\n\nAs an industrial architect and integrator, Dassault Aviation must manage a multitude of partners and suppliers while observing technical, legal and financial constraints, particularly in relation to contracts involving transfers of technology.\n\nR&D investments, technical and technological choices, and program innovations must satisfy customers' long-term operational needs and expectations, while integrating the requirements of increasingly stringent environmental emission standards for civil aircraft (noise, NOx, CO2, etc.).\n\nTo adapt to the market environment, Dassault Aviation needs to have flexible and responsive production lines, including within its supply chain, to ensure that the potential is in line with production commitments and be able to cater to customer demand.\n\n### **2.2.3. Cyber risks for IT systems**\n\nSince 2020, the cyber exposure of companies has increased and the risk of attacks has become much greater for the Group and its supply chain in particular.\n\nSince any IT system failure can result in data loss and business disruption, the Group has procedures in place and has taken steps to protect itself against the risk of its IT systems being attacked.\n\nBecause the human factor is a major issue in cybersecurity, regular efforts are made to raise awareness and remind employees and partners of the need for vigilance.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe surveillance and protection systems are continually being adapted at Group level in response to the changing threat. Communications infrastructure and systems have evolved in view of the need to work and interact online within a secure environment. The safeguards put in place and the architecture adopted by the Group have protected it from the main threats.\n\nThe recovery plan in the event of system shutdown is tested annually to ensure the continuity of operations.\n\nEffective IT protection also requires all sub-contractors in the supply chain to have robust systems as well as the implementation of an appropriate standard*.* In addition, an agreement was signed at the end of 2019 between the French Ministry of Armed Forces and the defense industry, calling on the latter to supply the armed forces with equipment that is more resistant to cyberattack.\n\nThe Group has also factored in the changing threat to onboard systems, the services offered to our customers, and our production facilities.\n\n### **2.2.4. Security risks**\n\nThe international context has led to an increase in the alert level both in France and abroad. At the end of 2023, the Company increased its level of vigilance with regard the threat of destabilization from various sources following the resurgence of tensions in the Middle East. This level of vigilance will remain the same in 2024 as, in the current geostrategic context, damage to the Group's reputation, industrial operations and the use of its fighter jets could seek to undermine national military sovereignty.\n\nThe Group's personnel and its industrial, technical and scientific assets are safeguarded by systematic site access control procedures, physical protection systems, operational assessment of suppliers and a \"security\" step in the recruitment process. The blurring of private and work lives caused by the organizational changes put in place since 2020 has prompted greater awareness about the importance of protective measures.\n\nThe security risk is also addressed by protecting the IT systems. The gradual introduction of remote working has significantly increased exposure to the risk of industrial espionage, particularly through attempts to steal data by phishing or other Trojan horses.\n\nEmployees are made aware of the cyber risk and radicalization in the workplace, as well as procedures to remind \"travelers\" of the precautions necessary for a safe trip.\n\n### **2.2.5. Risks related to personnel**\n\n#### **Risks related to the Group's attractiveness and the development and retention of talent (see NFPD)**\n\nThe Group's performance is highly dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and grow the talent necessary to manage and develop programs. The loss of technical skills is a risk as they are the Group's main asset and guarantee the quality expected by its customers.\n\nThe competitive environment requires the adaptation and continuous improvement of the organizational structure.\n\nDassault Aviation significantly increased the number of recruitments in 2022 to ramp-up production and renew its skill sets. To promote talent integration, retention and development, the Group introduced several support and training measures aimed at its employees.\n\nIn terms of occupational health and safety (see. NFPD), the Group's activities can give rise to various situations in which the health and safety of its staff could be at risk. A systematic policy of reducing occupational risks and improving working conditions has been in place for several years. The measures taken are described in Section 4.6.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2.2.6. Environmental risks**\n\nThe Group complies with the national and international regulations applicable in the countries in which it operates, as well as standards relating to the environmental performance of its products and activities.\n\n### **Risks of pollution or damage to the environment**\n\nIn terms of environmental risk control, the Environmental Management System (EMS) includes a risk analysis deployed in the Company's facilities and in its major subsidiaries.\n\nNo court has ever found the Group guilty of pollution or ordered it to pay compensation to repair damage caused to the environment. In 2023, the Group did not have to recognize any environmental liabilities.\n\nThe preventive measures taken are described in §4.7.\n\nRegarding the environmental risk of classified installations, the Company is only required to provide financial security for one of its facilities (Decree No. 2012-633 of May 3, 2012).\n\n#### **Risks related to the consequences of climate change (see NFPD)**\n\nDue to its geographical location, the Group has low exposure to the physical consequences of climate change, whether for its industrial sites or supply chain, which are mainly European and North American. The Group's only facility exposed to the risk of tornadoes, in Little Rock, Arkansas, has put in place a business continuity plan.\n\nThe fight against climate change is one of the European and national strategic ambitions, with a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and ambitious intermediate targets in 2030 and 2040. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted those targets in environmental standards incorporated into our product design requirements. This allows the Group to mitigate the transition risk associated with climate change.\n\nThe measures taken are described in Section 4.7.\n\n#### **2.2.7. Risks related to the implementation of Make In India**\n\nThe Group launched Make in India in view of the offset obligations linked to India's contract for the purchase of 36 Rafale. The Nagpur plant delivers fuselage sections for the Falcon 2000 and Rafale parts.\n\nThe growth of the business also depends on the local supply chain being extended to new suppliers.\n\n### **2.3. Reputational, regulatory and legal risks**\n\n#### **2.3.1. Corporate social responsibility**\n\nThe Group may be exposed to potential risks resulting from its products, activities or practices. To protect itself from risks that could have a lasting impact on its image, the Group has put in place organizational measures and CSR governance, as well as tools consistent with the risks identified. It has also established various operating procedures and issued guidance on best practice. These provisions underline Dassault Aviation's commitment to environmental, social, societal and governance issues.\n\nMost of these risks are regulated, and some are included in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration (\"NFPD\") in Chapter 4 of this report.\n\n#### **2.3.2. Compliance**\n\nThe nature of the Group's business means that it is subject to an extremely diverse and continually changing legal and regulatory framework with increasingly stringent requirements:\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n- in terms of product airworthiness, with aircraft program developments being regulated at the national, European and international level,\n- in terms of employees (see §4.5) and the protection of personal data,\n- in terms of the environment and occupational health and safety (see §4.6) and the Duty of Care,\n- In terms of the application of the anti-corruption mechanism (Loi Sapin 2, FCPA, etc.),\n- in terms of customs, economic, ethics, tax and financial regulations.\n\nThese regulations, at times extra-territorial in nature (particularly from the United States), create additional constraints and uncertainties (embargoes, restrictive financial and/or commercial measures, ITAR, ethics, etc.).\n\nThis complex regulatory environment has the potential to cause compliance risks and risks of obsolescence (particularly among certain suppliers and sub-contractors, with the associated costs and lead times), competitiveness or distortion of competition.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Group has established a compliance program to ensure strict compliance with laws and regulations, as well as a dedicated department - the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\n#### **2.3.3. Protection of intellectual property**\n\nInnovation has become an essential tool to guarantee the success of the Company's products.\n\nThe protection of the Company's intellectual property and know-how, principally via secrecy, patents, copyright and trademarks, is a major challenge in the protection of its assets. In particular, the Company uses intellectual property rights to protect its technology, to prevent competitors from using that protected technology, and to remain competitive. Regarding the FCAS/NGF contract, the Company has sought to guard against the risk of technology leakage.\n\nThe Company has always focused on protecting its innovations and its know-how through confidentiality. Employees are encouraged to take the necessary measures to avoid any inadvertent disclosure. Some of our innovations remain secret and evidence of their creation is produced, if necessary. Other innovations are patented, particularly in the context of the Company's civil and military programs.\n\nThe Company's portfolio of patents continues to grow. It comprises French or foreign patents filed in strategic countries. Trademarks are also filed regularly to protect the names of the Company's leading products and services in the countries where it operates. Awareness-raising sessions focusing on intellectual property and confidentiality are organized for the employees concerned to ensure they are able to actively protect technological assets.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to create inventions through a pay policy that has been tailored accordingly. An \"Intellectual Property Committee\" meets regularly to decide on the necessary protections for the Company's strategic inventions.\n\n### **2.4. Financial and market risks**\n\n### **2.4.1. Financial risks**\n\n#### **Cash and liquidity risks**\n\nThe Group investment portfolio is primarily composed of time deposit, debt securities and others securities with no significant risk of impairment.\n\nTreasury and investment portfolio allow the Group to face its commitments without liquidity risk.\n\n#### **Credit and counterparty risks**\n\nThe Group performs its cash and foreign exchange transactions with recognized financial institutions. It divides its investments and bank accounts among the various selected institutions.\n\nThe Group limits counterparty risk by conducting most of its sales in cash and ensuring that the loans granted to a limited number of customers are secured by export insurance guarantees (Bpifrance \n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nAssurance Export) or collateral. The manufacturing risk is also guaranteed with Bpifrance Assurance Export for major military export contracts.\n\nAdditional information is available in Notes 8 \"Trade and other receivables\" and 23.2 \"Management of credit and counterparty risks\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **2.4.2. Market risks**\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risks**\n\nThe Group is exposed to a foreign exchange risk through the Parent Company's Falcon sales, which are virtually all denominated in US dollars. The Parent Company's foreign exchange risk is partly hedged by its purchases in dollars, and partly by the use of forward exchange contracts and options(1). This risk is permanent, taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. This is a significant risk for the Group, since the measures put in place to limit this risk are not sufficient to make the net risk zero (periods not covered by hedges, possible financial impact of hedges already taken in the event of reversal of market assumptions).\n\n(1) A sensitivity analysis of the hedge portfolio can be found in Note 23.3 \"Management of market risks.\" For the sale of Dassault Aviation's military aircraft, movements in the dollar exchange rate can affect its competitiveness, as comparisons with competitors are made in this currency.\n\n### **2.5. Insurance**\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department implements the risk transfer policy of Dassault Aviation defined by the Executive Management.\n\nCoverage of all the risks generated by the aeronautical activities of Dassault Aviation and its subsidiaries (work-in-progress, changing aircraft, civil liability after delivery, maintenance and logistical support, etc.) constitutes the largest item of the insurance budget.\n\nCoverage is obtained from a broad panel of insurers and reinsurers that specialize in the aviation industry and offer high solvency margins to ensure they are able to handle any long-term claims.\n\nThe Group's sites, as well as its industrial facilities, are insured for fire and other risks.\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department oversees a regular audit program of the Group's sites. It disseminates the risk prevention and industrial facilities protection policy to reduce the frequency and intensity of accidental risks. To do this, it relies on the specialized engineers of the property damage insurer.\n\nOther programs are purchased in order to reduce risks not related to aviation activity: general civil liability, environmental damage, the fleet of vehicles, construction sites including assembly and testing and the civil liability of corporate officers and directors.\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department ensures that the Group's insurance coverage constantly adapts to changes in its structure and business.\n\nDassault Assurances Courtage and Agence Aéronautique d'Assurances are involved in the placement of risks. Dassault-Réassurance handles the subscription of reinsurance portions for the Group's aviation and fire risks.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3. INTERNAL AUDITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES**\n\n### **3.1. Internal auditing objectives**\n\nThe purpose of the internal auditing procedures set up in our Company is to:\n\n- ensure that the conducting of operations and management actions, and the behavior of staff fall within the framework defined by Executive Management, applicable laws and regulations, and our Company's internal values and rules,\n- verify that the information provided and communications addressed to the Board of Directors and to the General Meetings are reliable and give a true and fair view of the Company's activity.\n\nOne of the main purposes of the internal auditing system is to anticipate and control the risks resulting from the Company's activity and risks of error or fraud, particularly with respect to finance and accounting. However, as with any control system, it cannot provide absolute assurance that these risks have been totally eliminated.\n\n### **3.2. Environment and general organization of internal auditing**\n\n### **3.2.1. Internal auditing reference documents**\n\nThe Company's internal auditing is guided by the following reference documents:\n\n- the Quality Manual, which describes the Company processes,\n- the Organization Manual, which describes the tasks and organization of each department,\n- the economic and financial data management procedure described in the Quality Manual for accounting and financial activities,\n- an Anticorruption Code and an Internal Alert Procedure complete the processes that already exist,\n- a Supplier Vigilance Plan.\n\nDassault Aviation also draws on the AMF reference framework of July 22, 2010. Internal control activities are performed by each and every department.\n\n### **3.2.2. Control of subsidiaries**\n\nThe Parent Company maintains an effective presence on the Boards of Directors and management bodies of its subsidiaries.\n\nPeriodic directors' reports are prepared by each subsidiary for the Parent Company.\n\n### **3.2.3. Internal auditing**\n\nAttached to the Total Quality Management Department, the Internal Audit and Risk Department is tasked with assessing risk management and internal auditing processes.\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risk Director reports to Executive Management on the results of the audits and the recommendations implemented. The Internal Audit Director also presents the Internal Audit plan to Executive Management for approval prior to its implementation.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the Internal Audit and Risk Director and examines the Group's major risks, the audit plan and the findings of the audits.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.2.4. External auditing factors**\n\nThe Company operates in a particular external auditing environment due to its French government contracts and aviation activity:\n\n- the calculation of our cost price components (hourly rates, procurement and non-production expenses) as well as the cost prices of our activities related to French government contracts are examined by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA),\n- in the field of military aviation, product monitoring, our acknowledgment of design skills and our acknowledgment of skill in the production of Rafale for Export is overseen by the DGA,\n- the Company, in the field of civil aviation, possesses design, production and maintenance certifications. These certifications are subject to ongoing monitoring by the airworthiness authorities that have issued them:\n\t- o the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC),\n\t- o the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA),\n\t- o the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),\n\t- o Other foreign authorities depending on the market.\n\nThe Parent Company and its subsidiaries DFJ and DFS are EN 9100-, ISO 9001- and ISO 14001 certified. Audits conducted in 2023 by outside organizations confirmed the compliance of our management systems with the requirements of the standards.\n\n### **3.3. Risk management procedures**\n\nThe risk management organization detailed in Chapter 2 of this report is based on a risk mapping updated by each of the Company's major departments and primary subsidiaries of the Group for the activities that concern them.\n\nEach of the risks identified in this mapping, whatever its nature, has been assessed according to its seriousness and its frequency of occurrence. The procedures for handling risks are also recorded in this mapping.\n\nThe risk management procedures are defined and applied by the departments of the Company.\n\nIn particular, Program risk control at Dassault Aviation is performed through regular risk reviews organized by the Program Departments with the Operational Departments.\n\nRisks are monitored at the various stages in a product's life cycle for various reviews. The purpose of these reviews is to identify new risks and monitor and reduce existing risks.\n\nThe Total Quality Management Department, through the Internal Audit and Risk Department, notifies Executive Management of risks by transmitting the list of most critical risks identified.\n\nFinally, the Risk Committee's mission, based on risk mapping and a campaign of interviews with all Departments, is to:\n\n- validate the identified risks, their classification and the risk reduction actions carried out,\n- ensure that new risks are identified, taken into account and their financial impacts measured.\n\nTo this end, the Committee conducts interviews with senior directors of the Company who are responsible for updating the risk map.\n\nThe Committee also ensures that the risk management system is taken into account in its subsidiaries. It is chaired by the Senior Executive Vice President, Total Quality, assisted by the Director of Internal Audit and Risks, secretary of the Committee, and reports to the Executive Management.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.4. Internal auditing procedures for financial and accounting purposes**\n\n### **3.4.1. Organization of the financial and accounting function**\n\nThis function, described in the Quality Manual, is managed by the Finance Department for both the Parent Company and Group consolidation. This aforesaid function consists of:\n\n- validating and auditing the Company's financial and accounting information system, implemented by Information Systems General Management,\n- updating the consolidation software configuration used by the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n### **3.4.2. General references**\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with:\n\n- the accounting standards applicable to French companies:\n\t- o Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) Regulation 2014-03,\n\t- o subsequent opinions and recommendations of the ANC.\n- the international standards for the measurement and presentation of IFRS financial information in force as of December 31, 2023, as adopted by the European Union, which must be applied for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, for the consolidated financial statements,\n- the operating and control procedures described in the economic and financial data management procedure, supplemented by the special procedures for the preparation of company and half-yearly financial statements of the Parent Company and the Consolidated Group. These procedures and the IT applications used by the finance and accounting department are regularly reviewed by the Statutory Auditors in connection with their annual certification of the financial statements.\n\n### **3.4.3. Financial and accounting information process**\n\nIn 2023, the Finance Department centralized the accounting data and produced the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group.\n\nIt distributed a schedule of the tasks and controls to be performed at each period-end to the relevant persons in the Parent Company and subsidiaries. This schedule indicated the start date for the Statutory Auditors' certification procedures at approximately six weeks prior to the Board meeting at which the financial statements are submitted for approval.\n\nIn parallel, the reports and financial statements are checked by a review committee, independent of the teams participating in the drafting of these documents.\n\n### **3.5. 2023 actions**\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risks Department and the Total Quality Management Department continued to monitor the internal audit procedures for all parties involved by using the risk mapping that was updated during the year.\n\nThey performed the audits in order to verify the proper application of the internal auditing procedures.\n\n### **3.6. 2024 action plan**\n\nFor 2024, the Total Quality Management Department and the Internal Audit Department are tasked with continuing the audits that ensure oversight of internal controls and risk management, and the proper application of procedures.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4. NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION (\"NFPD\")**\n\n### **4.1. General Policy and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**\n\nSince joining the United Nations Global Compact in 2003, Dassault Aviation has committed itself to an active Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy. This policy, which has been enhanced over time, demonstrates the Group's commitment to its employees, environment and suppliers.\n\nBuilt on current CSR issues and backed by industry standards and rules, Dassault Aviation's CSR policy is built on five pillars.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/7 description: The image is a circular diagram divided into five colored sections, each representing a different aspect of corporate responsibility. In the center of the circle is the acronym \"RSE\". The sections are as follows: Green: \"Improve environmental performance of our activities and products\" with bullet points including reinforcing the low carbon Company plan, integrating eco-design, and reducing environmental footprint. Yellow: \"Be part of a responsible approach\" with bullet points including preventing corruption risks, reinforcing responsible purchasing, and keeping industrial risks to the lowest level. Blue: \"Propose an attractive and motivating social model\" with bullet points including attracting and retaining talent, promoting diversity and equal opportunity, and proposing attractive compensation and benefits. Red: \"Guarantee a high quality, healthy and secure workplace\" with bullet points including bringing the Company up to an effective prevention culture, continuing to reduce occupational risk, and developing the quality of life at work. Orange: \"Meet regulatory requirements and compliance obligations\" with bullet points including complying with international, national and local regulations, acting in accordance with commitments and charters, and listening to Company's stakeholders.\n\nWith this approach, Dassault Aviation is putting the social, environmental, and societal aspects of its business first.\n\nThe commitments thus made at the Group level reflect the sustainable development challenges adopted by the UN in 2015. The actions taken in this respect mostly contribute to 8 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Contribution of the Dassault Aviation Group to the Sustainable Development Goals**\n\nImage /page/91/Figure/3 description: The image is a circular diagram outlining Dassault Aviation's commitment to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The diagram is divided into 17 sections, each representing a different SDG. The SDGs are arranged in a circle around the Dassault Aviation logo. Each SDG is represented by its corresponding icon and a brief description. The SDGs are as follows: 1. No Poverty, 2. Zero Hunger, 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 5. Gender Equality, 6. Clean Water and Sanitation, 7. Affordable and Clean Energy, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production, 13. Climate Action, 14. Life Below Water, 15. Life on Land, 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, 17. Partnerships for the Goals. The image also includes text descriptions of Dassault Aviation's commitment to each SDG. The text descriptions are located around the outside of the circle.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.2. CSR organization**\n\nA Group CSR manager, appointed by Dassault Aviation's CEO, is responsible for defining a CSR policy based on the main issues and risks identified and for overseeing its application.\n\nThis manager and his or her team within the Total Quality Management Department relies on a network of CSR officers assigned to each department of the Parent Company and each Group subsidiary.\n\n### **4.3. Listening to the Company's stakeholders and meeting their expectations**\n\nListening to external and internal stakeholders and meeting their expectations is of fundamental importance for Dassault Aviation.\n\nOne of our chief concerns is listening to our customers; trade shows and customer days are an opportunity to do precisely that.\n\nEvents are also held regularly with our shareholders and suppliers.\n\nWe are actively involved in aviation industry bodies both in France (GIFAS, UIMM, AFEP, AFNOR, etc.) and internationally (ICAO, GAMA, EBAA, ASD, IAEG, IAQG, etc.).\n\nWe also maintain close ties with the academic community and with students in aeronautical disciplines through the various initiatives carried out (see Section 4.5.1 \"Attracting and retaining talent\").\n\nListening to our internal stakeholders is equally important. It is facilitated by meetings of the central or local Economic and Social Committee (CSE), of the central or local Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CSSCT), commissions and thematic committees (economic, training, employment/gender equality surveys, disability, etc.), or at various annual events.\n\nThe special relationships we forge with our stakeholders enable us to identify their expectations and factor them into our products, services and CSR policy.\n\n### **4.4. Identification of non-financial risks**\n\nTo identify and prioritize non-financial issues and risks, which are the building blocks of the CSR policy, the Parent Company performs a materiality assessment assisted by the network of CSR officers. The assessment includes:\n\n- mapping of the main Company risks (see Section 2 Risk factors),\n- CSR issues identified for aerospace companies by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB),\n- a summary of CSR issues identified in a panel of comparable national and international companies in terms of activity,\n- a non-financial risk assessment that takes into account the impact of issues for both Dassault Aviation and its stakeholders.\n\nThe materiality assessment was updated in 2023 based on new requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This updated version will be used to draft the next version of the CSR policy and its implementation through new action plans.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing this identification, the following issues and risks were selected in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration:\n\n| Challenges                                                     | Risk factors<br>(risk exposure)                                   | Policies                                                 | 2023 key performance<br>indicators<br>(reference 2019)                                                                                                                                                                                           | Sustainable<br>Development<br>Goals (SDGs)<br>affected |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attractiveness,<br>employment and<br>skills                    | Section<br>2.2 Risks<br>related to personnel<br>(moderate)        | Section<br>4.5                                           | % of staff trained: 75.8%                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Image: SDG 5 and SDG 10                                |\n| Health, safety<br>and working<br>conditions                    | Section<br>2.2 Risks<br>related to personnel<br>(moderate)        | Section<br>4.6                                           | Frequency rate of work-<br>related accidents: 7.14<br>(target: 7.50)<br>Severity rate of work-<br>related accidents: 0.29<br>(target: 0.33)                                                                                                      | Image: SDG 3 and SDG 8                                 |\n| Climate change                                                 | Section 2.2<br>Environmental risks<br>(moderate)                  | Section<br>4.7.1<br>Section<br>4.7.2<br>Section<br>4.7.4 | Energy consumption by<br>source:<br>- Gas: -21.5%<br>(target in 2024: -8.0%)<br>- Electricity: -8.0%<br>(target in 2024: -8.0%)<br>Greenhouse gas<br>emissions (scope 1<br>excluding kerosene and<br>scope 2): -20.8% (target in<br>2024: -8.0%) | Image: SDG 9 and SDG 13                                |\n| Traceability and<br>obsolescence of<br>hazardous<br>substances | Section 2.3.2<br>Compliance<br>(low)                              | Section<br>4.7.2                                         | Number of substituted<br>hazardous products: 494                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Image: SDG 3 and SDG 12                                |\n| supply chain:<br>customer duty                                 | Section 2.3.1<br>Corporate social<br>responsibility<br>(moderate) | Section<br>4.8.3<br>Section<br>4.8.6                     | % of new suppliers<br>processed: 100%<br>(target: 100%)<br>% of suppliers with a<br>negative opinion: 0.8%                                                                                                                                       | Image: SDG 8 and SDG 12                                |\n| Business ethics                                                | Section 2.3.1<br>Corporate social<br>responsibility<br>(moderate) | Section<br>4.8.7<br>Section<br>4.8.8                     | Number of acts of<br>corruption: 0<br>(target: 0)<br>Number of people trained:<br>755<br>(2393 since 2018)                                                                                                                                       | Image: SDG 16                                          |\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5. Offering an attractive and motivating employment model**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/5 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Each icon features a number and a title above a symbolic image, all set against a colored square background. SDG 5 is on a red background and shows the gender equality symbol. SDG 8 is on a maroon background and shows an upward trending line graph. SDG 10 is on a pink background and shows an equals sign inside a circle.\n\nThe development of the Dassault Aviation Group is based on the quality and commitment of its people. They are its main source of wealth. This principle is enshrined in the Code of Ethics.\n\n| Changes in registered headcount  | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2023 | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Dassault Aviation Parent Company | 9,778                            | 9,201                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Jet              | 2,052                            | 1,878                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Service          | 571                              | 556                              |\n| Sogitec                          | 288                              | 272                              |\n| DABS FBO/DABS                    | 373                              | 434                              |\n| ExecuJet                         | 471                              | 427                              |\n| Total                            | 13,533                           | 12,768                           |\n\n| Changes in active headcounts     | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2023 | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Dassault Aviation Parent Company | 9,347                            | 8,825                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Jet              | 2,046                            | 1,862                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Service          | 508                              | 500                              |\n| Sogitec                          | 279                              | 262                              |\n| DABS FBO/DABS                    | 359                              | 416                              |\n| ExecuJet                         | 461                              | 419                              |\n| Total                            | 13,000                           | 12,284                           |\n\nMore than 96% of the Group's employees are on open-ended contracts. The geographical distribution of the Group's headcount is as follows:\n\n| France            | 79% |\n|-------------------|-----|\n| Americas          | 15% |\n| Rest of the world | 6%  |\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5.1. Attracting and retaining talent**\n\nThe Group's Companies invest in preparing the talents who will join us after completing their studies or retraining.\n\nThe Group thus works in cooperation with the academic and research community.\n\nIn this context, the Group's companies:\n\n- support students during their studies through internships, work-study programs and France's international business volunteer program (VIE – Volontariat International en Entreprise). In 2023, the Group's companies took on 489 interns (35 VIE participants) and 344 work-study students, thus demonstrating the willingness to support the training of young people in our businesses and facilitate their entry into professional life. More than 45% of French subsidiary apprentices were hired at the end of their apprenticeships.\n- participate in consultations on how to adapt curricula to the medium and long-term needs of the aviation industry. These consultations are carried out within professional bodies such as GIFAS, and with educational institutions and organizations (engineering colleges, universities, vocational high schools),\n- encourage their staff to take part in vocational or multidisciplinary courses and examination boards and to supervise technical projects,\n- make their recruiters available to educational institutions several times a year to prepare future graduates for recruitment interviews,\n- promote an awareness of our business lines by organizing meetings (forums, Group presentations, etc.) and visits to our sites for pupils, students and their advisors (teachers, career counselors, principals, etc.). Targeted actions for middle school and high school students have been carried out to foster diversity within technical and scientific professions.\n\nWe also contribute to the general skills development of future technicians, engineers and researchers by creating or participating in teaching and research chairs. This takes the form of financial support, which we supplement with the participation of our experts in the development of educational and research projects for the benefit of the academic and scientific community.\n\nDue to the major recruitment demand for manufacturing staff for the Dassault Aviation Parent Company, around ten training programs have been set up with external bodies to \"build skills\" and support people undergoing retraining with professional certification in metallurgy at the end of the course (CQPM - Certificat de Qualification Paritaire de la Métallurgie). A school of mechanics was created in April 2023 at Dassault Aviation's Argonay site. This specific and made-to-measure training course was designed by our teams and is taught by in-house trainers and partner organizations: AFPI-Etudoc and IMAA.\n\n### *Measures undertaken in India*\n\nThe Indian government-approved Dassault Skill Academy was created in 2018 to develop new training courses in India for the aviation industry. It was designed to be a two-year training course equivalent to the French professional aviation diploma (Baccalauréat professionnel aéronautique). Since the start of the 2019/2020 school year, the training has been based in a public high school in Nagpur (Maharashtra State). The high school teachers were trained by French teachers and are now qualified to take over. Building on this success, the project was then rolled out in two new professional high schools in the state of Maharashtra. Since then, all graduates have been recruited by various aviation companies in Maharashtra and Telangana.\n\nIn 2023, the Indian government signed a partnership agreement with our subsidiary in India for the creation of the \"Dassault Aviation Center of Excellence for Aeronautical Vocational Training\" within the National Skill Training Institute in Kanpur (state of Uttar Pradesh). This center of excellence will help prepare future Indian teachers for the widespread roll-out of this training.\n\nWith regard to higher education, a network of excellence bringing together Nagpur's VNIT (Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology - the city's largest engineering school), CESI (the Nanterre school of engineering in France) and Dassault Aviation, was founded in 2023 through the signing of partnerships. These partnerships will allow both schools to set up academic and research exchanges and also bring Indian students selected by Dassault Reliance Aviation Limited (DRAL) to France to complete the final year of their studies. An academic semester at CESI followed by an internship at Dassault Aviation\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nprepares students for recruitment at DRAL, giving them a taste of the products, tools, processes and the Dassault culture in general.\n\n#### *Paris Le Bourget Air Show*\n\nDuring the International Paris Le Bourget Air Show, the Group's companies took part in the fifth edition of the \"Careers Plane.\" Almost 50 Group employees presented their professions - fitters, layout fitters, system architects, structural mechanics and maintenance engineers - to inspire young people to enter the trade.\n\nDuring the Paris Le Bourget Air Show, the Group also took part in the Paris Air Lab, an exhibition dedicated to innovation, where our specialists presented the \"FalconWays\" project, a flight optimization tool which allows pilots to select the most efficient route to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions.\n\nDuring the \"L'Aéro Recrute\" recruitment event, organized by GIFAS, more than 80 Group employees welcomed a great number of visitors, providing them with information and advice to guide them in their career choices.\n\n#### *Communication initiatives*\n\nTo enhance its employer brand image, the Group has bolstered its presence on social media and become more vocal about its recruitment needs, increasing the number of actions to be more visible at a national and local level.\n\nIn 2023, the Parent Company once again featured in the TOP 5 of the Universum France ranking of the 130 best places to work, across all sectors, according to engineering students. It was also ranked number one in the \"Aerospace, rail, naval\" sector of the Statista rankings for the economics magazine CAPITAL (out of 39 companies ranked in the sector).\n\nDespite the pressures on the job market in 2023, the Group continued recruiting by seeking the best possible match between costs, headcount and skills requirements.\n\nAs a result of this policy, 1,947 employees were recruited in 2023.\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/13 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing data from 2023 and 2022. The bar for 2023 is blue and has a value of 1947. The bar for 2022 is gray and has a value of 1564.\n\nTo facilitate the integration of their new hires, the Group's companies have put in place programs that explain their business, set-up and operation.\n\nDassault Aviation has significantly improved its employee onboarding process with the launch of two new schemes:\n\n- \"Les Journées Envol\" (Take-off Days) allow new hires to discover Dassault Aviation's history and business alongside Directors and pilots,\n- The Dassault Defense Academy presents the geopolitical context, France's defense policy, the structure of the national army corps and the role of the military in Dassault Aviation's DNA.\n\nDFJ invites all new employees and interns to take part in the \"Welcome to Dassault Falcon Jet Passport\" program. This scheme provides access to a LinkedIn Learning platform where employees can access more than 16,000 courses taught by industry experts covering sales, innovation and technology subjects.\n\nRecruitment and onboarding initiatives are essential. They help prepare for the future and facilitate the intergenerational transfer of skills.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Employees leaving the Group**\n\nImage /page/97/Figure/3 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing values for 2023 and 2022. The bar for 2023 is blue and has a value of 1182. The bar for 2022 is gray and has a value of 1167.\n\nAmong employees leaving the Group, the resignation rate is around 3% of the workforce.\n\n### **4.5.2. Development and transfer of skills**\n\nIndividual development of each employee is an essential condition of collective success. With 75,8% of employees trained in 2023, the Group has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining and developing its employees' skills.\n\n### **Vocational training**\n\nGroup companies continue to develop distance learning in the skills development plan. These measures also address the constraints of geographical dispersion and optimize future skills development for employees. The initiatives took into account the operational needs of the Group's companies, the development of the roles and technologies, and individual development preferences. Professional training represents 293,275 hours of training.\n\nDassault Falcon Jet also relies on a tuition assistance plan to enable its employees to join a higher education program that will develop their skills. This program, directly related to the position held by the employee, reflects his or her career development prospects. A total of 337 employees have benefited from this scheme since it was set up.\n\n### **Skills Conservatory and support for digital tools**\n\nAs part of its skills conservatory, Dassault Aviation launched a pipe fitter training course in 2023 that had been tested at the end of 2022. This course rounds out the range of training courses for professions such as process planners and assemblers. Moreover, the functional business lines also have targeted courses covering business-specific issues, such as the Purchasing Passport and the Supply Chain Academy. The latter focuses on synergies between all vocations that work in the supply chain.\n\n### **Strengthening the Group's management**\n\nStrengthening its management is a priority for the Dassault Aviation Group, which guides the development of its managers throughout their career. The Dassault Institute has continued to hold training courses for the Group's French subsidiaries. In 2023, 492 managers or future managers of the Group's French companies were trained.\n\nMore specifically, Dassault Aviation launched a support plan for its managers to help them communicate and inform their teams about the impact of the new collective bargaining agreement for the metallurgy industry that has been in force in France since January 1, 2024. A total of 1,128 managers were thus trained under this plan.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, DABS continued with its \"Shaping our Future\" program which was launched in 2022. A total of 90% of managers therefore started the Managerial Training Cycle covering the first two themes: the role of manager and the manager coach. Five other themes will be covered during 2024.\n\n### **4.5.3. Promoting diversity and equal opportunities**\n\nThe Group promotes diversity in the workplace and is highly committed to the principles of nondiscrimination. Firmly believing that diversity is a major issue and a performance factor for the company, the Group restates its commitment to preventing discrimination and is committed to promoting equal opportunities and treatment in compliance with national regulations.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the signing of company-level agreements in the following areas:\n\n- professional equality between women and men,\n- employment and retention in employment of persons with disabilities,\n- careers of staff representatives.\n\n### **Gender equality at work**\n\nThe Group pursues its policy of developing gender balance in the company by implementing specific measures, particularly in the technical, industrial, management and aircraft maintenance professions.\n\nThe Group is facing the issue of fewer women enrolling in initial technical and industrial training courses. The development of scientific and technical careers among women is therefore an important issue.\n\nVarious initiatives are aimed at girls in middle school and high school to encourage them to take vocational courses relevant to the aviation sector; Dassault Aviation is a founding member of the association \"Elles bougent\" (\"Girls on the Move\").\n\nOn March 8, 2022, Dassault Aviation signed the charter \"Féminisons les métiers de l'aéronautique et du spatial\" (\"Women in the aeronautics and space industry\"). Signatories to the charter can share best practices and take part in initiatives organized by Airemploi to showcase career opportunities in the aviation industry and debunk stereotypes and prejudices. By signing the charter, Dassault Aviation has underlined its commitment to gender diversity within the industry.\n\nDFS and Dassault Aviation also took part in the \"Women in the Aeronautics Industry\" drive launched for the Paris Le Bourget Air Show.\n\nWomen account for 18.9% of the Group's workforce, a slight increase from 2022. As a result of the Group's proactive policy, women made up 22.2% of all recruits in 2023 (excluding apprentices).\n\nConcerning the French companies of the Group, this percentage is 23.7%, and 24.2% for Dassault Aviation Parent Company.\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/18 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing data from 2023 and 2022. In 2023, the total is 13,533, with women representing 18.9% and men representing 81.1%. In 2022, the total is 12,768, with women representing 18.6% and men representing 81.4%. The chart includes a legend indicating that the lighter blue color represents women and the darker blue color represents men.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this regard, the recent appointment of a woman at the head of Technical Management Department could serve as a fresh source of inspiration for a great many women within the Group or interested in joining it.\n\nThe Group also pays particular attention to the training and development of women's careers, helping to promote them to positions of responsibility, particularly in management and senior management.\n\nThe Group is also mindful of gender equality in its compensation and promotion policies. The French companies have a compiled gender equality score of 87 out of 100. This is well above the regulatory threshold of 75.\n\nThe Group's French Companies all have an agreement on gender equality and equal pay. Priority is given to initiatives to recruit women in all professional categories and to support their career development so that they can go on to hold positions of responsibility.\n\n### **Employment and retention in employment of persons with disabilities**\n\nThe Group continues its policy of recruitment and retention of persons with disabilities. The Group's French Companies all have an agreement on hiring and retaining people with disabilities.\n\nRegular communication initiatives are carried out, particularly with the academic community, local organizations for the employment of disabled people and disability-friendly companies. The Group's companies participate in specialized forums and organize awareness-raising actions with employees and recruiters.\n\nDassault Aviation is a member of the association Hanvol, which offers a unique training scheme for the return to work of disabled people with diverse backgrounds and skills but a shared goal: to work in the aerospace sector.\n\nConcrete measures are being taken to modify workstations and to facilitate and encourage formal recognition of the status of employees with disabilities and renewal of that recognition. The Group relies on cooperation between its HR teams, medical professionals from occupational health services, EHS staff and ergonomists to institute the necessary initiatives and arrangements to retain employees with disabilities. The Parent Company has earmarked an annual budget of EUR 400,000 for the period 2021- 2023.\n\nAn awareness campaign focused on disability in sports was launched in November 2023 during European Disabled Workers Week across all nine of the Parent Company's facilities. The campaign featured role plays, quizzes, and demonstrations of adaptation solutions to raise awareness surrounding disability.\n\nThe Group is also committed to ensuring that employees with disabilities benefit from the same opportunities for pay increases and career advancement as other employees.\n\nIn late 2023, the Dassault Aviation Group employed 607 disabled workers, compared to 578 in 2022. The Group has a disabled employment rate of more than 6% across the three entities, in compliance with French employment law.\n\n#### **Careers of staff representatives**\n\nDassault Aviation and Dassault Falcon Service are implementing agreements signed in 2019 on social dialog to facilitate the functioning of union organizations and staff representative institutions. More specifically, those agreements provide a career monitoring mechanism for the careers of staff representatives to ensure equal treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the French Companies of the Group give employee representative institutions many additional resources compared to those provided for by law.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5.4. Offering attractive compensation and benefits**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group is committed to attracting talent and keeping its employees highly motivated by offering them stimulating projects along with an attractive compensation policy.\n\nThis compensation policy rewards and inspires loyalty among its employees, while adapting to the economic situation and the economic environment to maintain the Group's competitiveness in a highly competitive market. Employee retention is illustrated by the average length of service of 13.3 years.\n\nThe average annual pay of Group employees in 2023 was EUR 62,480.\n\nThe average annual gross salary for a non-managerial employee was EUR 39,644 in 2023, which is 1.9 times the French minimum wage (SMIC). To this is added any team bonuses and overtime (or other) which represent on average nearly 10% of the salary.\n\nDassault Aviation has a redistribution policy that is fully in keeping with its value-sharing philosophy. Dassault Aviation has chosen not to have a share award policy; instead it has opted for a direct contribution to the company's performance through an attractive redistribution policy based on profitsharing and incentive schemes. The Group's French companies have signed profit-sharing opt-out agreements and particularly advantageous incentive agreements, enabling employees to have a share in the profits. In all, 78.6% of the Group's employees benefit from these schemes. The amounts awarded over the last five years have represented on average 3.1 months of salary for the employees of Dassault Aviation Parent Company.\n\nThe average annual pay of the Group's French Companies, including profit-sharing and incentives, was EUR 77,875. For Dassault Aviation, the lowest salary was EUR 37,465, including the profit-sharing paid in 2023 relative to 2022, and EUR 35,215, including the average profit-sharing paid for the last 5 years.\n\nThese companies also promote employee savings by offering company savings plans with a wide choice of investments, as well as a group pension plan.\n\nThe Group offers all its employees medical cover.\n\nThe Group's French companies paid more than EUR 30 million (i.e. more than 5% of the payroll) to the social and economic committees at their facilities, enabling employees to enjoy numerous social and cultural activities. The budget will also fund various sports associations for the benefit of all employees who want to play sports or do physical exercise.\n\n#### **4.5.5. Constructive employee relations**\n\nThe Group has an employee relations policy which is built on trust, compromise, and mutual respect.\n\nTrade unions representing the professional interests of employees are present in all French subsidiaries and DFJ Do Brasil. They cover more than 78% of the Group's workforce.\n\nIn Group entities with employee representative bodies, regular negotiations give rise to constructive social dialog based on the search for collective agreement.\n\nIn 2023, 24 agreements and amendments were signed. These notably covered subjects including pay, pensions, gender equality, hiring and retaining people with disabilities, the roll-out of the new branch collective bargaining agreement and the organization of professional elections.\n\nRegular constructive discussions with social partners mean that any changes which the Group is going through can be taken into account accordingly. For the Group's French companies, 2023 saw the continuation of discussions with social partners regarding the challenges and roll out of the new branch collective bargaining agreement which was signed in February 2022.\n\nThis social dialog within the Group helps to maintain a climate conducive to the proper functioning of the companies. For the French companies, more than 130 meetings were held between the Management and members of the social and economic committees and more than 46 meetings between the Management and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committees. Social dialog is also expressed at joint committee meetings during which plans for the organization of the Group's companies, questions of employment and gender equality, and issues around health, safety and working conditions, among others, are discussed. This social agenda provides a framework for employee relations and allows staff representatives to stay up to date on the issues facing the Group.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, some Group entities that do not have staff representatives have set up direct communication channels with senior management.\n\n### **4.6. Ensuring a high-quality, safe and healthy work environment**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/5 description: The image contains two icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first icon, on the left, is green and represents SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. It features a white heartbeat symbol. The second icon, on the right, is maroon and represents SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features a white upward-trending line graph.\n\n### **4.6.1. Fostering an effective culture of prevention throughout the company**\n\nThe Group continued developing a safety culture in 2023, in line with the CSR policy defined in 2020. This involves the sustainability of practices and tools that promote proactive management of occupational health and safety and the training and awareness-raising of those involved in prevention.\n\nSince 2022, the Parent Company has had a fully operational environment, health and safety (EHS) training course for new managers, consisting of four modules. Moreover, EHS aspects are being gradually incorporated into vocational training courses so that they can be applied in practice.\n\nAt the end of 2023, a managerial roadshow including EHS aspects was launched to improve daily good practices.\n\nIn this respect, Dassault Aviation has designed an EHS management framework built around four levels of maturity, in line with the ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 standards, with level one corresponding to basic proficiency and level four to operational excellence. At the end of 2023, six Parent Company facilities, representing 81% of staff, had achieved, or were very close to achieving level three status. Actions plans remain underway at the other facilities.\n\n### **4.6.2. Continuing to reduce occupational risks and improve working conditions**\n\nControlling the risk of workplace accidents and occupational diseases means reducing physical and chemical risks.\n\nActions to manage chemical risk are ongoing. In 2023, the Company continued with efforts to provide additional collective protection, such as the installation of new bonding booths for canopies and windshields, the installation of extractor hoods and equipment for paint touch-ups, and the improvement of local extraction systems.\n\nEfforts continued to make working at height safer, ensuring that this work is carried out safely on the Falcon production line or on the roofs of buildings.\n\nGroup-wide, absenteeism in 2023 was 96,866 days from all causes, compared with 112,843 in 2022, excluding maternity and parental leave.\n\nThe number of work-related accidents with lost time was 149 in 2023. The corresponding number of days lost was 6,005 days.\n\nThe Group frequency rate (FR) has decreased over the past ten years, from 10.97 in 2013 to 7.14 in 2023.\n\nThe severity rate (SR) dropped from 0.39 to 0.29.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/3 description: This line graph compares the values of FR and SR from 2012 to 2023. The FR line starts at 10.21 in 2012, peaks at 10.97 in 2013, then decreases to 8.38 in 2014 and 8.44 in 2015. It rises to 9.57 in 2016 and 8.77 in 2017, then slightly decreases to 8.68 in 2018 before rising to 9.13 in 2019. The line then drops to 6.24 in 2020, rises to 7.67 in 2021, and plateaus at 7.13 in 2022 and 7.14 in 2023. The SR line starts at 0.42 in 2012, decreases to 0.33 in 2013 and 0.32 in 2014, then drops to 0.28 in 2015. It rises to 0.39 in 2016 and remains at 0.39 in 2017, then decreases to 0.31 in 2018 and 0.30 in 2019. The line then rises to 0.33 in 2020, 0.38 in 2021, and 0.39 in 2022 before dropping to 0.29 in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, 28 occupational illnesses were identified by the various competent authorities, compared with 15 in 2022. These were primarily musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n#### **4.6.3. Developing quality of life at work and fostering employee well-being**\n\n### **Ergonomics and working conditions**\n\nTo promote a culture of ergonomics and ensure that ergonomic considerations are factored into new projects and programs, training courses are held. Moreover, more than 80 ergonomics officers have been trained across all sites.\n\nErgonomics are taken into account in the industrialization phase via a specific \"EHS/ergonomics\" training module delivered by the Dassault Aviation conservatory; this is an integral part of the vocational course for process planners and toolmakers. A total of 56 employees have been trained since it was set up in 2021.\n\nLastly, a network of 15 trainers specializing in risk prevention during physical activities and in body posture and movement provide training at the Parent Company's facilities. In 2023, 220 employees attended these training courses, learning about what actions they can take to prevent musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nAt the same time, the workplace transformation to take better account of ergonomics continued in 2023, focusing on:\n\n- reducing the risk of accidents linked to manual load handling by purchasing suitable equipment (trolleys, stacker trucks, lifting platforms, hoists, etc.), reorganizing storage facilities, and redesigning tools to make them more lightweight,\n- addressing the causes of musculoskeletal disorders (setting up and equipping workstations, workbenches and desks so that they can be raised, lowered and/or reclined, using pivotable tripods and testing exoskeletons for the thumb, neck, back and arms/shoulders),\n- The reduction of noise pollution in shared offices: provision of active noise-reduction headphones (6,000 employees to be equipped over three years – 2023/2025),\n- accommodating disabilities; adapting workstations, purchasing suitable equipment, etc.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Preventing psychosocial risks**\n\nA renewed focus has been placed on psychosocial risks. In 2021, the Parent Company introduced a system for assessing collective psychosocial risks in the workplace in order to gauge the risk and take the necessary corrective measures.\n\nWhen the Quality of Life and Working Conditions agreement was renegotiated and signed on February 14, 2023, the Parent Company undertook to introduce a new mechanism in 2024 to assess psychosocial risks for each company employee. Specific support will be offered to managers to analyze the results of this assessment and launch any necessary action plans.\n\nThe system will supplement the detection and monitoring of individual psychosocial risks carried out by internal or inter-company occupational health services.\n\nDassault Aviation has an agreement in place with the Psychological Support and Resources Institute (IAPR), which offers a listening and support system for employees who are victims of workplace stress and psychological trauma.\n\nTo prevent harassment, sexist behavior, sexual assault and discrimination at work, the Group's companies have introduced internal mechanisms for identifying and dealing with problematic situations. Formalized procedures have been published, notably at Dassault Aviation and ExecuJet, covering more than 75% of employees.\n\nIn 2023, the Parent Company also continued the practice launched in 2022 of arranging meetings enabling employees to discuss with their manager what actions could be taken to work together better. Nearly 900 meetings were held in 2023. This long-term approach is part of the agreement relating to quality of life and conditions at work.\n\n#### **Quality of life at work**\n\nThe Group has long encouraged a work/life balance, particularly through schemes to help parents.\n\nSome Group companies provide access to an inter-company crèche.\n\nSince 2021, Dassault Aviation has implemented a digital and physical corporate concierge scheme, offering employees local services that are readily accessible and that help them manage personal tasks. The services available are regularly updated to meet employees' needs. The digital concierges will now be offering one-off physical onsite services (such as bike repair, etc.).\n\nWorking hours also contribute to quality of life at work. Tailoring working hours to accommodate the personal needs of individual employees leads to a more flexible organization and improves shift management within the Group's French Companies. All Group companies offer part-time hours, subject to the manager's approval. More than 78% of the Group's workforce has a \"working time account\" to help employees manage their annual leave.\n\nThe Group's French Companies have signed company-level agreements on remote working, balancing personal and professional life while maintaining collective efficiency.\n\nIn terms of societal challenges, mobility is also a matter of concern for employees. The Parent Company has introduced a sustainable mobility scheme, through which the company contributes up to EUR 200 toward the purchase of a manual or electric bicycle. In 2023, 328 bonuses were paid through this scheme. The Parent Company's facilities are improving their infrastructure to accommodate bicycles and ensure their safe use.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Medical monitoring of employees**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has autonomous occupational health services or assistance programs at all of its sites.\n\nEmployees in high-risk positions or who are expatriates or on mission receive specific monitoring and specialized additional support. This includes more regular medical check-ups and additional examinations paid for by the Group.\n\nPrevention and awareness campaigns, local or Group-wide, are organized, periodically or occasionally, on a variety of themes, professional or public-health related:\n\n- influenza (awareness campaign and free vaccinations),\n- heat wave-related risks,\n- low back pain and injuries from carrying heavy loads,\n- help with addiction (tobacco, alcohol, psychotropic products, games, cyberdependency),\n- food hygiene,\n- psychosocial risks,\n- cardiovascular diseases,\n- organ donation,\n- sleep disorders.\n\n### **4.7. Improving the environmental performance of our activities and products**\n\n#### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/104/Figure/18 description: The image shows four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) which is green and features a white heartbeat symbol; SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) which is orange and features a white cube structure; SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) which is brown and features a white infinity symbol with arrows; and SDG 13 (Climate Action) which is green and features a white eye looking at the earth.\n\nThe environment is the core focus of Dassault Aviation's CSR policy. The aim is to reduce the footprint of the Group's products and activities, while mitigating the risks of pollution and environmental damage. The policy takes the form of an environmental methodology (\"Eco-démarche\") consisting of projects and actions to improve environmental performance throughout the life cycle of our products.\n\nReducing our environmental footprint means factoring EHS requirements into aircraft development programs, into contracts with suppliers and partners, into the search for new processes and materials, into plans for new infrastructure or production facilities, and into the operational support given to our customers.\n\nThe Group has been committed to this proactive environmental approach for more than 15 years, relying to that end on the ISO 14001 management standard. The Group's research offices and production facilities are certified. This includes all Dassault Aviation sites, the Dassault Falcon Jet facility in Little Rock and the Dassault Falcon Service locations in Le Bourget and Mérignac. Together the certified sites represent almost 90% of the Company's total workforce.\n\n#### **4.7.1. Factoring eco-design into the search for innovative technical solutions**\n\nOver the past 40 years, technological progress with regard to engine efficiency, aerodynamics and weight saving has reduced fuel consumption, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions and noise levels from our aircraft. The Group is continuing on this path, both in the search for technological innovations and in the optimization of the aircraft in operation.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo support this strategy, the Group has long embraced the goals set in 2000 by the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) and participates in European studies that contribute to them, such as the CleanSky program and its successor, Clean Aviation.\n\nIn France, Dassault Aviation, as a member of the Civil Aviation Research Guidance Council (CORAC), is involved in the studies conducted in that framework. Dassault Aviation is also on the steering committee for the air transport value chain (Article 301 of the French Climate and Resilience Act) and contributed to the publication of the road map for decarbonizing air transport presented to the French government on February 14, 2023.\n\nDassault Aviation reiterated its commitment in June 2023 during the International Paris Le Bourget Air Show by signing a statement with six other major aviation players (Airbus, Boeing, GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce and Safran), acknowledging their shared objective of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and underlining the importance of the production and availability of sustainable aviation fuel to achieve this objective. In October 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) invited Member States to achieve the same target for international civil aviation. In September 2023, the ICCAIA (International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Association) set out the commitment of manufacturers to supply products that are 100% SAF compatible by 2030.\n\n### **Environmental footprint of aircraft**\n\nThe environmental footprint is modeled using a life-cycle analysis (LCA) approach, in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, for the Falcon 8X, Falcon 7X and Falcon 2000. The modeling identifies the impact of each stage in the aircraft's life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its end-of-life solution. Various indicators are used: the potential for global warming, the depletion of natural resources, the depletion of the ozone layer, the potential for acidification and the eutrophication of water.\n\nThese studies show that aircraft use accounts for more than 95% of greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life cycle, while highlighting the significant contribution of the kerosene production phase. On that basis, Dassault Aviation has directed most of its efforts toward improving energy efficiency during the operational phase and promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), while also maintaining projects to improve other environmental aspects, such as the choice of bio-sourced materials in the fittings of Falcon cabins.\n\nThe long service life of aircraft (potentially more than 30 years) means that life cycle constraints must be anticipated in the design phase. To achieve this, Dassault Aviation takes an innovative approach, supported by efficient digital industrial processes such as Product Lifecycle Management.\n\nThe aircraft sold by Dassault Aviation are repairable throughout their operation and offer significant endof-life recyclability potential (85%, according to the ISO 22 628 standard defining the calculation methodology for road vehicles, in the absence of a similar standard for aircraft). This is due to the reusable equipment and the materials used (such as aluminum in particular).\n\n### **Technological aircraft innovation**\n\nDassault Aviation is engaged in European and national initiatives (Clean Sky and Clean Aviation) and leads or participates in concept and development studies in conjunction with the entire aviation sector. These studies relate to:\n\n- reducing the weight of primary structures with new materials and processes (new metal alloys, composites),\n- reducing the weight of some complete equipment and components and lowering the \"buy to fly ratio,\" i.e., the ratio between the quantity of materials of a part and the quantity of materials purchased and transported to make it (metal additive manufacturing, thermoplastics),\n- consolidating the principles of design and manufacture of surfaces with increased laminar flow and performance, achievable due to the drag reduction thus obtained,\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n- using sustainable aviation fuels, which must be compatible with fuel systems and engines when blended with conventional kerosene at high percentage levels, with the aim of achieving 100% SAF operation,\n- optimizing flight planning and management to reduce fuel consumption, launched under the commercial name FalconWays,\n- optimizing take-off and landing trajectories to reduce ground noise,\n- researching concepts and technologies for noise reduction at source, without adversely affecting aircraft mass and/or aerodynamic drag.\n\nIn addition, work on the \"certifiability\" of disruptive technologies, with specific demonstrations and associated numerical modeling, is being done as part of Clean Aviation's Concerto project, coordinated by Dassault Aviation in partnership with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\n#### **Methods and processes**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group is pursuing its efforts to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of its design methods, production processes and maintenance services by harnessing the tools offered by digital technology:\n\n- co-engineering methods are tested and implemented to ensure the best trade-offs between design, production and support,\n- the optimization of the entire testing process (new types of instrumentation, processing and data analysis) and hybridization of simulation models and test data reduces the number of development flight tests and the processing cycle for any adjustments,\n- advances in digital technology help demonstrate why the aircraft meets the certification criteria,\n- efforts to optimize the production cycle are taking the form of research into eco-design, new materials, additive manufacturing and waste recycling,\n- alternative solutions are being sought for the treatment and protection of parts against corrosion, such as the removal of chromates from the processes,\n- the development of algorithms for automated fleet data processing aims to increase predictive maintenance capabilities.\n\n### **Optimization of aircraft in operation**\n\nThanks to its longstanding contribution to French (CORAC) and European (SESAR, CleanSky/CleanAviation) research programs, as well as through its own self-funded research, Dassault Aviation is capable of developing and integrating the most advanced technologies in its aircraft to minimize the environmental footprint of the Falcon fleet and in particular its CO<sup>2</sup> emissions: preparation and optimization of flight planning, flight assistance systems such as FalconEye cameras/head up displays, navigation and communication systems.\n\nWe share best practices and flight optimization recommendations with Falcon fleet operators. The aim is to maximize the environmental efficiency of flight operations. This includes optimizing loads on board, the flight profile in terms of speed and altitude and flight paths. These practices are supported by onboard digital tools made available to pilots, such as the new FalconWays solution. This software takes into account real-time weather data to allow pilots the option of adjusting flight plans to optimize the use of winds at different altitudes and thus reduce fuel consumption and therefore the associated emissions.\n\nFor optimal flight efficiency, it is also important that aircraft maintenance is carried out according to a set schedule. Our teams work actively on a daily basis at our maintenance centers around the world to carry out operations which keep Falcon aircraft operating at peak operational and environmental efficiency. Our maintenance centers, as Group subsidiaries, are also committed to reducing their carbon footprint in line with the CSR policy. This is achieved through the implementation of energy saving plans targeting the heating and electricity supply of the centers, but also through the gradual introduction of carbon-free maintenance resources, such as electric runway generators and airfield tractors.\n\nPilots working for our Falcon customers are made aware of these best practices and environmental issues at special meetings or at events during international trade shows and forums.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)**\n\nFalcon models are already SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) compatible and certified for a blend limit of 50%.\n\nDassault Aviation is working with the engine and equipment manufacturers of its aircraft currently in development to validate the feasibility of 100% SAF in its new models for the entry into service of the Falcon 10X. The same goal is shared by the VOLCAN project, in which Dassault Aviation is involved in partnership with Airbus, ONERA, Safran and the DGAC (Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile – the French Civil Aviation Authority). We are preparing all of our models currently in production for the use of SAF above the current blend limit of 50%, in line with the industry-wide objective of achieving compatibility with a 100% blend of sustainable fuel by 2030.\n\nThe SAF plan, which was launched in 2022, continued in 2023 and will continue in 2024. As a result, we are using SAF for our operations out of French airports Le Bourget and Bordeaux-Mérignac, as well as from our Little Rock facility (United States). Levels of SAF uplifted currently varies between 25% and 35% depending on our suppliers' capacities, with this percentage substantially ahead of the ReFuelEU European Directive which is targeting 2% SAF in 2025 and 6% in 2030. This demonstrates the commitment of the business aviation industry to decarbonize as quickly as possible.\n\nA total of 413 flights were operated with SAF in 2023, representing a reduction of 681 TCO2eq.\n\nThe overall reduction in CO<sup>2</sup> emissions over the life cycle of SAF (production followed by use in flight) is close to 80-90%, according to international benchmarks. During their combustion, SAF also release fewer pollutants into the atmosphere, such as sulfur, and could help to limit the production of condensation trails.\n\nSAF supply chains are taking shape. Dassault Aviation is committed to promoting the use of SAF in its own operations and in those of its customers, working closely with GAMA, NBAA and EBAA.\n\nDassault Aviation has been a member of the RLCF (Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance) since its creation in 2022. The alliance, launched by the European Commission, is the industrial pillar of the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which aims to phase in progressively SAF by 2050.\n\n### **4.7.2. Reducing our environmental footprint according to the principles of the circular economy**\n\nAs part of its CSR policy, Dassault Aviation has set three-year targets for reducing its environmental footprint. The desired performance improvement targets energy consumption, water consumption, air emissions and waste recovery.\n\nThe targets initially set for 2021-2023 based on the available performance analysis were revised in 2022 to reflect guidance on energy saving from the French government. The year 2020, disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis, is not representative of the Company's activities. The year 2019 was therefore chosen as the reference year.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Themes                                                        |                                             | 2024 targets<br>(Ref. 2019) | 2023             | 2022             | Group performance<br>Like-for-like change since 2019* |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                               | Electricity (GJ)                            | -8%                         | 499,936          | 500,596          | -8.0%                                                 |\n|                                                               | Self-produced renewable electricity (GJ)    | 40,000                      | 1,006            | Not available**  | NA                                                    |\n|                                                               | Gas (GJ)                                    | -8%                         | 281,471          | 312,634          | -21.5%                                                |\n| Optimize consumption of resources                             | Other sources – heating oil and diesel (GJ) | Stability                   | 7,297            | 7,804            | -56.7%                                                |\n|                                                               | TOTAL                                       | -8%                         | 789,710          | 821,034          | -13.5%                                                |\n|                                                               | Kerosene (GJ)                               | NA                          | 411,770          | 506,992          | -26.0%                                                |\n|                                                               | SAF 30% (m3)                                | 2,900                       | 1,016            | 369              | N/A                                                   |\n|                                                               | Water (m3)                                  | Stability                   | 215,654          | 230,401          | -11.4%                                                |\n| Minimize the use of hazardous chemicals                       | Hazardous products removed or substituted   | NA                          | 494 (since 2013) | 405 (since 2013) | 138.00                                                |\n|                                                               | VOC (T)                                     | Stability                   | 97               | 110              | -41.3%                                                |\n| Reduce waste generation and discharges into the water and air | Non-hazardous waste (T)                     | Stability                   | 7,207            | 6,187            | 0.9%                                                  |\n|                                                               | Hazardous waste (T)                         | Stability                   | 1,788            | 1,425            | -34.1%                                                |\n|                                                               | Total waste (T)                             | Stability                   | 8,995            | 7,629            | -8.3%                                                 |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\n\\*\\*Production began in 2022 and is currently in the test phase; consolidated data as of 2023.\n\n### **Energy consumption**\n\nThe energy management system is integrated with the ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. There is no plan for ISO 50001 certification.\n\nA network of energy experts, trained in 2022, was set up at the Parent Company level to improve energy performance management and the rollout of improvements, particularly those resulting from the energy audits carried out at Dassault Aviation facilities in late 2019. Regulatory energy audits were carried out in 2023 and will contribute to improving action plans.\n\nEnergy is mostly consumed within the framework of the industrial activity of the production sites (electricity and gas), and the aviation activity (kerosene).\n\nElectricity consumption remains stable compared to 2022 despite an increase in the number of hours worked, as a result of the energy-saving efforts made by all of the Group's entities, including behavioral change, reducing equipment operating ranges, optimizing temperatures in server rooms, installing LED lighting and optimizing consumption management.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nDirector's report\n\nGas consumption decreased significantly owing to the beneficial impact of temperature reduction recommendations, the improvement in technical building management, and recovering of heat from server rooms undertaken under the energy saving plan.\n\nIn response to the appeal from the French government, a large-scale energy saving plan was launched in September 2022. The aim is to reach the target of 10% less consumption by 2024 relative to the base year (2019). Coordinated by an energy saving manager appointed at Group level and by energy saving advisors at each French facility, the plan focuses on several areas:\n\n- reducing electricity and gas consumption by following government guidance on heating and air conditioning,\n- optimizing the energy efficiency of systems and equipment such as technical aeration plants, compressors, datacenters and computer workstations,\n- switching from conventional lighting to LED lighting,\n- introducing technical energy management and technical building management as standard at all facilities,\n- producing renewable energy by installing photovoltaic panels at all facilities where this is technically feasible.\n\nCommunication was ramped up to facilitate buy-in and rally all employees behind these goals, both within the company and outside it.\n\nThe first results from this energy saving plan were noted in the consumption readings as of the end of 2022, as a result of the immediate implementation of organizational and behavioral measures. The first technical measures, including the widespread use of LED lighting and the introduction of technical energy management at certain facilities, were implemented in 2023, confirming the positive effects of this plan. The plan will reach its full potential by 2025 once photovoltaic panels and technical energy management is rolled out at all facilities.\n\n66% of other combustion energies are consumed by a single site following its relocation in 2022 to new premises, resulting in the use of heating oil. The remaining consumption is related to the use of diesel during operational testing of the sprinkler system motor pump units and during the operation of emergency generators.\n\nIn the context of new construction and renovation of buildings, energy and environmental performances are systematically sought in the interests of economic balance. New building designs factor in the requirements of the applicable French thermal regulations.\n\nSeveral of the Dassault Aviation Group's activities require aircraft fuel consumption, in both the civil and military sectors (ground and flight tests as part of new programs, end of production tests, ferry flights, demonstrations, pilot training, commercial flights). Consumptions varied depending on these activities in 2023 but they all contributed to an overall reduction in kerosene consumption. Conversely, SAF consumption increased, underlining the Group's commitment to working to decarbonize the sector of activity.\n\n### **Water consumption**\n\nTo date, all of the Dassault Aviation's facilities as well as those of its subsidiaries have access to a sufficient quantity and quality of water. Most water comes from public water supply networks, and to a lesser extent from groundwater pumping (nearly 5% in 2023). Most water is used for non-industrial purposes.\n\nIn 2023, water consumption was down by more than 10% on a like-for-like basis relative to 2019. This was due to the introduction of remote working, a partial move away from irrigating green spaces, the installation of flow restrictors in toilets and the fixing of leaks.\n\nAccording to the WRI's (World Research Institute*)* Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, four facilities are located in high risk or extremely high risk zones. The consumption of facilities in these zones at risk of water stress represent 7% of the Group's water supply.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/110/Figure/3 description: This image is a donut chart titled \"Water supply\". The chart shows the following data: (0-1) Low: 52%, (1-2) Low - Medium: 40%, (2-3) Medium - High: 6%, (3-4) High: 1%, (4-5) Extremely High: 1%.\n\nThe main objective over the next few years is to maintain the current level of water consumption, since most of the savings were achieved in the past (consumption of more than 700,000 m3 before the 2000s for the Parent Company alone and stable at the Group level since 2011 at around 200,000 m3). Particular attention will nevertheless be paid to water management in high risk zones.\n\n### **Raw materials**\n\nAluminum, titanium, steel and composites are the materials most widely used for the manufacturing of our products. By weight, aluminum is the predominant material used in the structure of our aircraft. For example, it accounts for more than 75% of the structural weight of a Falcon 8X. Dassault Aviation works with suppliers that are part of the sector's efforts to promote the increasing integration of recycled raw materials.\n\nThe search for a reduction in raw material consumption is a permanent objective, which includes:\n\n- the development of new technologies, such as composite or direct plastic and metal fabrication, which consumes less raw material. The Group's main direct metal fabrication unit is now fully operational at the Argonay facility,\n- the use of centralized platforms to regulate raw material volumes consumed,\n- selective sorting of scrap metal and composites, and returning them to the raw materials value chain, according to circular economy principles. A recycling process for composite by-products was set up in 2022 with the participation of Dassault Aviation.\n\nPaper consumption was down 35% compared with 2019, and stable compared with 2022, a testament to the sustainability of dematerialization efforts made during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n### **Chemicals**\n\nFor several years, actions aimed at limiting the use of hazardous chemicals have been carried out for CMR products (Carcinogens, Mutagens, Reprotoxics) subject to the REACH regulation (chromates, nonylphenols, siloxanes, terphenyls, etc.).\n\nThe modernization of the machinery fleet and the changes in processes contribute to the optimization of the quantities of chemicals used.\n\nThis optimization involves the qualification and deployment of alternative processes such as: replacement of chemical machining by mechanical machining, removal of chromates in surface treatment processes (Anodic Chromic Oxidation replaced by Anodic Sulfuric Oxidation, stripping without chrome VI), substitution of chromated paint primers and removal of octylphenols from sealants.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have taken future REACh regulations into account in our Company strategy: terphenyls in sealants, bisphenol A in epoxy resins, lead in electronics, PFAS restriction proposals which could have a major impact across all business sectors. As part of the European Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the recasting of chemicals regulations (REACH, F-GAS, ODS, etc.) are also being monitored.\n\nA Chemical Product Unit has been in place for more than ten years to advise on new products used in production or maintenance. This makes it possible to select, early on, the least hazardous chemicals for our industrial processes and to anticipate regulations so as to avoid the risks of obsolescence in the long term.\n\nSince 2013, 494 hazardous products have been removed, replaced or are being substituted.\n\nAt the same time, Dassault Aviation informs its customers about the presence of hazardous substances in aircraft via REACH – Article 33 declarations and maintenance manuals that specify the substances contained in certain aircraft components (chromates, lead, cadmium, bisphenol A, terphenyl, etc.). The potential risk during specific operations is thus identified, allowing the appropriate measures to be taken depending on local regulations.\n\n### **Wastewater**\n\nThe production sites likely to generate industrial wastewater are equipped with detoxification stations or wastewater treatment installations of the \"zero liquid discharge\" type. For heavy metals, these installations have discharge rates lower than the value limits set by the regulations.\n\nOut of all the sites involved in the monitoring of the Release of Hazardous Substances in Water (RSDE), only Mérignac is subject to continuous regulatory monitoring.\n\n### **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other atmospheric releases (excluding GHGs)**\n\nProduction activities require the implementation of chemical products, including solvent-based paints and cleaning products that emit VOCs. These VOC emissions are monitored under solvent management and facility emission control plans.\n\nThe more than 40% decrease in emissions compared with 2019 is the result of using products containing fewer solvents and efforts to prevent their evaporation.\n\n### **Fight against food waste and insecurity**\n\nThe Group has not identified any challenges for this issue.\n\n### **Waste**\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year saw a major increase in the production of non-hazardous waste, compared with 2022, but the production of this waste is stable compared with 2019, in line with objectives. This mainly included metal waste generated by the machining activity at the Secline site, which is growing rapidly in line with the Company's planned ramp-up.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Development of the circular economy**\n\n| Themes                                                                                |                                   | 2023<br>targets<br>(Ref:<br>2019) | 2023 | 2022 | Group performance<br>Like-for-like<br>change<br>since 2019* |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Developing the circular<br>economy,<br>in particular through the<br>recovery of waste | % recovery<br>total waste         | 80.0                              | 85.5 | 86.0 | 9.0                                                         |\n|                                                                                       | % recovery<br>non-hazardous waste | 90.0                              | 91.7 | 90.7 | 5.5                                                         |\n|                                                                                       | % recovery<br>hazardous waste     | 50.0                              | 60.6 | 65.4 | 10.1                                                        |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\nAccording to the principles of the circular economy, sites identify their hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams and seek the most suitable recovery and disposal solutions for their local environment, such as new recycling channels for furniture, sorting densification and landfill limitation.\n\nThe increasing integration of composite materials in aircraft provides significant weight saving, which means a reduction in CO<sup>2</sup> emissions during the operational phase. A share of production residues generated by these new activities are now considered as by-products and reused as raw materials in a dedicated branch set up in 2022.\n\nFive main processes are used for the end-of-life of our by-products and waste:\n\n- recycling of by-products, notably for composites,\n- reuse, mainly through collections set up with furnishing, electric and electronic eco-organizations,\n- recycling of metal, paper, cardboard and plastics,\n- energy recovery, the main sector for hazardous waste and mixed non-hazardous industrial waste,\n- bio-waste recovery.\n\n### **4.7.3. Keeping industrial accident risks to a minimum**\n\nIn order to prevent accidental pollution, the sites are equipped with oil separators, fitted dumping areas and containment basins for fire-extinguishing water.\n\nSites located over water tables have instituted monitoring of the water quality (piezometer) when their activities so require.\n\nEach site has a collection area specifically designed for the storage of its waste to avoid accidental pollution.\n\nSoil pollution diagnostics are carried out prior to civil engineering works or when land or buildings are sold. If historical pollution is identified, technical solutions are put in place to render the soil compatible with the intended use.\n\nThe risks of fire and explosion are assessed in each facility, and are covered by action plans to minimize them. The actions carried out as part of these plans include risk segregation, automatic fire detection and protection, and organizational measures.\n\nThe Group's French industrial sites are subject to ICPE (Classified Installations for the Protection of Environment) legislation. They hold the required administrative authorizations and none are classified as SEVESO.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.7.4. Strengthening the company's low-carbon plan in response to climate change**\n\nTackling climate change is a priority for the Company's CSR policy. GHG emissions reduction targets are set over three-year periods.\n\nTo align those targets with the 2050 trajectory, in 2021 Dassault Aviation worked with an expert company in this field. Accessible climate scenarios and an associated climate transition plan are currently being drawn up while measures have already been launched, as described in the previous sections.\n\nIn 2023, a Corporate Social Responsibility performance indicator was defined and is included in the corporate governance report. The low-carbon plan is one element of this indicator.\n\n| Themes                      |                        | 2024 targets<br>(Ref. 2019) | 2023<br>(TCO2eq.) | 2022<br>(TCO2eq.) | Like-for-like<br>change since<br>2019* |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Control<br>GHG<br>emissions | Scope 1 Non-kerosene   | -8%                         | 18,516            | 21,030            | -14.7%                                 |\n|                             | Scope 1 Kerosene + SAF | NA                          | 27,186            | 34,057            | -27.8%                                 |\n|                             | Scope 2                | -8%                         | 18,706            | 18,643            | -26.2%                                 |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\n### **Scope 1 and 2 emissions**\n\nThe greenhouse gases taken into account are those covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Their emissions are expressed in metric tons of CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent. Emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are derived for scope 1 from direct emissions from the Group's air activity, combustion plants, the use of company vehicles and refrigerant leaks.\n\nYear on year, scope 1 emissions are down due to the reduction in industrial energy consumption resulting from the launch of the energy saving plan and the implementation of the first phase of the SAF plan.\n\nDassault Aviation has decided to speed up the replacement of its fleet of company and service vehicles above and beyond the regulatory requirements laid down in the French Mobility Orientation Law (Loi sur l'Orientation des Mobilités). The fleet, historically composed of diesel and gasoline vehicles, is thus transitioning toward hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nAt the end of 2023, low-emission electric and hybrid vehicles accounted for 43% of the Company's car fleet, representing an increase of 20% compared to the previous year.\n\nIn parallel with the replacement of the vehicle fleet, more than 360 charging points were also installed during 2023.\n\nEmissions associated with kerosene combustion are directly related to our aircraft activity. The Group's SAF plan implemented since July 2022 (see Section 4.7.1) continues and has been extended, contributing to the mitigation of these emissions. A total of 413 flights were operated with SAF in 2023; representing a reduction of 681 TCO2eq., i.e., an increase of 169% compared with 2022.\n\nAs in previous years, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions reports required for the Emissions Trading Scheme were produced for the Group's aviation business in France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nScope 2 emissions from electricity consumption were stable in 2023.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, the last GHG assessments and energy audits were carried out at eligible sites in France at the end of 2023.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.7.6. Biodiversity**\n\nPreservation of biodiversity is taken into account when challenges require it. Accordingly, whenever new buildings are constructed at the Group's facilities, action is taken to avoid and mitigate any impacts on biodiversity.\n\nWhere avoidance and mitigation are insufficient, environmental offsetting measures are used, such as reforestation or restoration of wetlands and habitats of protected species.\n\nDassault Aviation does not however limit its commitment to controlling the impact of its new buildings on biodiversity. Dassault Aviation is thus a Patron of Maubuisson forest (Val d'Oise, Ile-de-France region). The Maubuisson project is unprecedented in the Ile-de-France region, with the planting of a million trees of 30 different species. This 1,340 ha of forest will benefit a population of 100,000 people in seven neighboring communities as well as the 12 million inhabitants of the Ile-de-France region.\n\n### **4.7.7. Respect for animal welfare and responsible food**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group's activities have no impact in these areas.\n\n### **4.8. Adopting a responsible approach**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/11 description: The image shows five icons representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. From left to right, the first icon is green and represents \"Good Health and Well-Being\". It features a white heart rate line. The second icon is maroon and represents \"Decent Work and Economic Growth\". It features a white bar graph with an upward trending arrow. The third icon is orange and represents \"Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\". It features a white geometric structure. The fourth icon is gold and represents \"Responsible Consumption and Production\". It features a white infinity symbol with an arrow. The fifth icon is blue and represents \"Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions\". It features a white dove holding an olive branch above a gavel.\n\n### **4.8.1. Safety culture**\n\n### **Airworthiness and Safety**\n\nThe Group works closely with the French and international airworthiness authorities, both civil and military. It has set up an organization to meet airworthiness requirements in design, production, maintenance and training for civil (PART 21, PART or FAR 145) and military (EMAR 21-G and EMAR/FR 145) aircraft.\n\nThe Group is regularly audited by the authorities (the French Department of Civil Aviation, the French Defense Procurement Agency, etc.), which verify compliance with the regulations on design, production and testing, maintenance, and safety management.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to improve the safety of its civil and military aircraft, Dassault Aviation has introduced a Safety Management System (SMS) based on ICAO recommendations, covering the entire aircraft life cycle.\n\nAn Executive Aviation Safety Officer coordinates the Safety Management System, promotes the safety culture and provides an independent assessment of all flight safety issues for civil and military aircraft and related activities for the entire Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe SMS was implemented by DFJ and DRAL in 2022. This roll-out continued in 2023 in the MRO subsidiaries of the Parent Company.\n\nMoreover, the Parent Company strives to promote the SMS culture at the suppliers of its supply chain.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Safety and Security**\n\nThe Safety/Security organization within the Company is structured around three areas:\n\n- Defense and Industry Security aimed at protecting the Company's assets (tangible and intangible), natural persons (employees) and legal persons (image, reputation).\n- Information System Security (ISS), relating to the protection of digital assets, IT systems, personal data and intellectual property rights.\n- Product Safety, covering protection with regard to aircraft safety, continuity of flight operations, operational maintenance of aircraft, continuity of service to Falcon passengers and the property of product users, such as personal data.\n\nFor each area, an officer from the Parent Company is appointed to oversee the activities.\n\n#### **4.8.2. Military aircraft production and export policy**\n\nDassault Aviation designs, manufactures, sells and supports military aircraft: Rafale, Mirage, ATL2, multi-mission Falcon.\n\nLinked to the government's foreign and defense policy, the production and export of war materiel are activities:\n\n- strictly regulated by French laws (since the Second World War),\n- carried out in accordance with European and international commitments entered into by France.\n\nCompanies involved in the manufacture or sale of war materiel may not do business unless they have authorization from the State and are under its control.\n\nIn the interests of sovereignty, the State has granted authorization to Dassault Aviation for the manufacture and sale of military aircraft. It also grants it export licenses through a robust and strictly enforced procedure.\n\nOn that basis, Dassault Aviation:\n\n- has a manufacturing and trade authorization granted by the French Ministry of Armed Forces for a maximum period of five years; the authorization is renewable, if necessary following investigation by the police, gendarmerie and prefecture in the areas where its plants are located,\n- cooperates with regular site inspections and document checks carried out by officials from the relevant ministries,\n- includes on its Board of Directors a government commissioner appointed by order of the French Ministry of Armed Forces,\n- carries out its design and production under the supervision and/or project management of the DGA (Direction générale de l'armement du ministère des Armées – French Defense Procurement Agency).\n\nFor exports of war materiel in particular, two general principles apply in France:\n\n- principle of prohibition: arms exports are prohibited, unless an exemption is granted by the State and subject to its control (there is no freedom of enterprise or trade in this respect); the exemption is applied by granting export licenses for war materiel;\n- principle of interministerial coordination: the Prime Minister bears ultimate responsibility for export controls.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nBy law, the State is responsible for the evaluation of France's military customers via a strict authorization process overseen by three regulatory bodies:\n\n- the CIEEMG (Commission interministérielle pour l'étude de l'exportation des matériels de guerre Interministerial Commission for Scrutiny of War Materiel Exports); the interministerial aspect ensures that export license applications undergo proper scrutiny5;\n- the SGDSN;\n- the DGA.\n\nThe provisions of Articles L. 2335-1 et seq. of the French Defense Code define the legal framework for authorization.\n\nExport transactions are examined retrospectively to ensure that they comply with the authorization granted by the CIEEMG. This procedure, which contributes to the robustness of the scrutiny process, includes manufacturers' compliance with any conditions imposed when the export license was issued.\n\nConsequently, the selection and evaluation of military customers, as well as the export of military aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (with the associated after-sales support), are subject to the strict supervision of the French authorities. They have the sovereign power to decide in which countries and under what conditions Dassault Aviation is authorized to enter into a contract with a military customer of the State.\n\nInterestingly, the Rafale aircraft of the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy contribute to the French nuclear deterrence policy through their ability to deploy the ASMP-A nuclear missile. This capability and this missile cannot be exported, in compliance with France's non-proliferation commitments.\n\nThe French Parliament is kept regularly informed of the activities of defense companies during parliamentary debates and through the publication of an annual report that addresses the need for transparency. The French Senate and National Assembly also hold select committee hearings at which defense company executives are asked questions. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation attends such hearings several times a year.\n\n### **4.8.3. Upgrading our approach to sustainable procurement**\n\nDue to the specific features of its sector of activity, and in accordance with its purchasing policy, Dassault Aviation is committed to sustainability processes in the choice of its partners.\n\nIn the framework of its industrial and purchasing activities, the Dassault Aviation Group:\n\n- supplies, manufactures and integrates all the constituent elements of its aircraft,\n- builds the interior fittings of Falcon business jets according to its customers' requirements,\n- controls its supply chain,\n\n- installs replacement and maintenance equipment that ensures the best service for customers,\n- ensures the operational availability of the aircraft.\n\nThese activities are based on an extensive supply chain with a strong national component, with a significant economic and social impact at the territorial level.\n\n<sup>5</sup> The CIEEMG examines applications for export and transfer licenses from manufacturers. The Commission, chaired by the SGDSN (Secrétariat général de la défense et de la sécurité nationale – Secretariat-General for Defense and National Security), brings together representatives of the French Minister for Defense, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for the Economy. Where appropriate, favorable opinions expressed by the CIEEMG may be accompanied by conditions, as well as the requirement for a non-re-export clause and an end-use certificate. The Prime Minister's decision, taken on the advice of the CIEEMG, is notified to Customs, which then issues any approved licenses.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises**\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an economic crisis, Dassault Aviation:\n\n- is involved, under the aegis of GIFAS, in monitoring the actions implemented within the framework of the \"Charter of commitment on customer and supplier relations within the French aeronautics sector,\"\n- is continuing to support its suppliers, focusing on financial aspects such as reducing payment times and taking into account - on a case-by-case basis - measures adapted to energy price changes.\n\nFor several decades, the Dassault Aviation Group has worked with and supported a broad network of aerospace companies and contributes to the evolution of many SMEs. The very nature of Dassault Aviation's products and the related services entails a long-term relationship with its suppliers.\n\nActive participation in professional bodies such as GIFAS and CIDEF allows Dassault Aviation to support SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the French aerospace supply chain in their plans to improve competitiveness and reduce their environmental footprint, etc.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to the SME Defense Pact membership agreement with the French Ministry of the Armed Forces. The Group is involved in the updating of this agreement, underlining its commitment to advancing French SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the Defense sector, and to strengthening good business practices.\n\nDassault Aviation also contributes to the ACE Aéro Partenaires investment fund. This fund aims to support SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the aviation industry. In the prospective countries, Dassault Aviation involves SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in cooperation and offsets.\n\n### **Purchasing policy**\n\nDassault Aviation's purchasing policy is designed to secure the Group's supply chain by improving the structural assessment of suppliers. This assessment is performed when referencing or monitoring a supplier to ensure that it is maintained in compliance with the guidelines. Structural risks are now taken into consideration in the Purchasing Policy.\n\nThe supplier approval procedure has been in place since 2007. It has been changed to include the provisions relating to the \"Sapin 2\" and \"Duty of Care\" laws, as well as cyber-security challenges.\n\nTo allow the referencing of a supplier, a structural assessment consists of five components:\n\n- Financial health,\n- Security,\n- Cyber-security,\n- Management of health, safety in the workplace, the environment and chemical products,\n- Compliance (anti-corruption, human rights and fundamental freedoms).\n\nSupplier monitoring, which takes into account these same themes, is performed regularly through semiannual campaigns, or when a significant event occurs.\n\nFor example, Dassault Aviation carried out almost 500 structural analyses of 100% of new suppliers approved in 2023.\n\nThe collaborative work with suppliers is based on the deployment of the \"BoostAeroSpace/Air Supply\" digital platform, which is the aviation industry standard. Dassault Aviation is reinforcing this approach with the commitments set out in the recovery plan and the Supplier Charter.\n\nDassault Aviation pays particular attention to the management and performance of its supply chain particularly through the supply chain committee, which defines the strategy in this area.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Volume of purchases**\n\nIn 2023, the order commitments of the Dassault Aviation Group were in the region of EUR 4.4 billion. France accounts for almost 80% of purchases.\n\n### **4.8.4. Territorial influence**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has a significant French and international territorial network:\n\n- Dassault Aviation: nine sites in France,\n- Dassault Falcon Service: two sites in France,\n- Sogitec: two sites in France,\n- Dassault Falcon Jet and its subsidiaries: five sites, four in the United States, and one in Brazil,\n- Dassault Aviation Business Services: four sites in Europe,\n- ExecuJet MRO Services: nine main sites, one in South Africa, two in Belgium, one in Malaysia, one in the United Arab Emirates and four in Australia/New Zealand,\n- Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited: one site in India.\n\nThe Falcon maintenance subsidiaries also have several international technical divisions which are not listed because their size does not warrant it.\n\nAll these entities rely on a large number of suppliers who contribute to the local economy.\n\nDassault Aviation is a certified Approved Economic Operator.\n\nThe Group actively participates in local bodies, competitiveness clusters and regional professional bodies:\n\n- In France: Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Territorial Economic and Social Councils, Environment Committees, Aerospace Valley, SAFE in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, BAAS, Aérocampus, ESTIA campus, Agency for Development and Innovation (ADI), Alpha Route des Lasers (Alpha RLH), Bordeaux Technowest, PDIE and AEROTEAM in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region, ASTech in the Ile-de-France region and CESI (the Nanterre school of engineering in France).\n- In the United States: Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce, State of Arkansas Work-force Development, Delaware River Administration, and the Arkansas, Delaware and New Jersey Economic Advisory Committees.\n\n### **4.8.5. Inclusion, humanitarianism and culture**\n\nThrough sponsorship agreements and charitable actions, the Dassault Aviation Group supported various non-profit organizations and institutions in 2023, including: Hanvol, Elles bougent, la Fondation des Œuvres Sociales de l'Air, l'Association pour le Développement des Œuvres Sociales de la Marine, l'Association des Anciens de l'École Navale, l'École d'Enseignement Technique de l'Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace, le Syndicat Mixte d'Aménagement de la Plaine de Pierrelaye-Bessancourt, Aviation Sans Frontières, Rêves de Gosses, la Course du Cœur, la Fondation Foch, l'Ordre de la Libération, l'Association de la Flamme sous l'Arc de Triomphe, la Fondation des Ailes de France, l'Académie de l'Air et de l'Espace, la Fondation de l'Académie des Technologies, le Musée de la Marine, l'Association pour le Grand Prix de l'École Navale, Cultivate Women in Business, Women in Aviation, Habitat for Humanity, Arkansas Food Bank, American Red Cross, Muscular Dystrophy Association.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4.8.6. Duty of care**\n\nWith its Code of Ethics and decision to support the UN Global Compact in 2003, Dassault Aviation affirmed its commitment in this area very early on.\n\nA system for assessing the risks at Group level (see Section 3.3 Risk management procedures) identifies the main risks and manages their potential consequences for the company and its stakeholders.\n\nIn parallel with this system, a Group-wide vigilance plan was drawn up in 2017 to assess the risks of serious breaches in the areas of the environment, occupational health and safety, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The plan covers all suppliers with whom the Group has an established business relationship.\n\n### **General framework**\n\nThrough its organization and internal processes (Human Resources, CSR, Ethics and Compliance, etc.), Dassault Aviation takes into account the risks generated by its activities and services that come under its duty of care.\n\nThe risks of serious breaches directly related to the Group's activities are addressed by the Company Risk Committee.\n\nAn evaluation and monitoring mechanism for production sub-contractors, which was extended to Europe and India in 2019 and covers environmental and occupational health and safety risks, is also in place. Since then, 261 production sub-contractors have been evaluated, with 35 identified as being at risk. Those sub-contractors have undergone surveillance audits and taken part in awareness-raising.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the network of service centers were also evaluated on this basis.\n\n### **Specific framework supplementing the Duty of Care law**\n\nAn additional vigilance plan, in accordance with the requirements of Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of care, is in place to deal with the Group's supply chain and identify suppliers at potential risk.\n\nThe main components of this vigilance plan are:\n\n- risk mapping by country, taking into consideration environmental criteria, rights and freedoms of work, and health, safety and working conditions. It is based on global indicators published periodically by specialized organizations such as Yale University, UNICEF and ILO,\n- risk mapping by activity (industrial, tertiary, completion, infrastructure, etc.),\n- a risk assessment by supplier, incorporated into the approval and oversight process, based on standardized IAEG and GIFAS questionnaires and questionnaires specific to the company,\n- an onsite evaluation process that may result in an audit for high-risk subsidiaries and suppliers,\n- a mechanism for the internal reporting of potentially risky situations detected among suppliers that gives anyone outside the Company an additional opportunity to use one of the existing means of communication to submit any reports. This is part of the Company's whistleblowing procedure,\n- a \"vigilance\" commission which examines aggregated reports.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Themes                                                              | Group performance                                                      |                                                       |            |            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                     |                                                                        | Objective                                             | 2023       | 2022       |\n|                                                                     | Number of suppliers processed                                          | All suppliers in the process of approval or follow-up | 397 (100%) | 533 (100%) |\n| Anticipate supplier risks, especially for sub-contracted activities | % of suppliers with a high-risk location or business                   | -                                                     | 15%        | 20%        |\n|                                                                     | % of progress in the assessments of production sub-contractors at risk | 100%                                                  | 84%        | 87.5%      |\n|                                                                     | % of suppliers with a negative opinion                                 | -                                                     | 0.8%       | 0.6%       |\n| Anticipate the supplier risks of subsidiaries                       | Number of suppliers processed by subsidiaries                          | -                                                     | 385        | 240        |\n\nThe vigilance plan has been implemented within the main subsidiaries: Dassault Falcon Service, Sogitec and Dassault Falcon Jet.\n\nSince the scheme was introduced in 2018, the Group has not detected any supplier with an immediate significant risk. Nevertheless, among the assessments carried out, a few suppliers had weaknesses in one of the areas assessed. They are placed under supervision and action is taken (e.g. on-site audits) proportionate to the risk identified. Three audits were carried out in 2023.\n\nIn parallel, a campaign to raise buyers' awareness of CSR issues was carried out to enhance their contribution to risk management. This module, which is part of the Purchasing training course, has raised awareness among 121 buyers since 2021.\n\nThe Total Quality Management Department coordinates the vigilance plan and ensures the correct operation and effectiveness of the process in place. In 2021, an audit was conducted by the Internal Audit and Risks Department of Dassault Aviation on the Parent Company's compliance with Law 2017- 399 of March 27, 2017, governing the Duty of Care.\n\n#### **Conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold)**\n\nAlthough Dassault Aviation does not source directly, the Company is particularly vigilant about the origin of certain minerals (such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) used in its products, in accordance with US regulations derived from the Dodd-Frank Act and Regulation (EU) 2017/821.\n\nTo share information with its customers, Dassault Aviation has set up an organization to compile information from its supply chain on the provenance of such minerals. This topic is included in the supplier evaluation questionnaire during the accreditation stage. In addition, a CMRT (Conflict Minerals Reporting Template) has been collected annually since 2020, mainly from electronics suppliers likely to use these minerals in the manufacture of their components (386 suppliers questioned in 2023).\n\nWe also collected information on other controversial minerals (cobalt, mica) using the EMRT (Extended Minerals Reporting Template) and CRT (Cobalt Reporting Template).\n\nIn 2023, we received 465 supplier reports (294 CMRT and 171 EMRT or CRT). For 2024, the aim is to compile information on cobalt systematically and to expand the panel of suppliers targeted.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.8.7. Respect for human rights**\n\nIn line with OECD Guidelines (updated in 2023), Dassault Aviation is committed to responsible business conduct for the respect of Human Rights.\n\nThe Group has introduced a comprehensive system to manage human rights-related risks: Code of Ethics, dedicated internal organization, due diligence and vigilance plan which details the measures put in place to prevent and mitigate the risks around human rights in compliance with international conventions and the French Duty of Care Law (Loi sur le Devoir de Vigilance) of March 27, 2017.\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group, whose main facilities are located in France and the United States, is committed to the respect of all national and international laws and regulations regarding human rights, especially as regards occupational health and safety of employees and non-discrimination in the workplace. It acts in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the provisions of the OECD and the International Labour Organization relating to Human Rights.\n\nDassault Aviation joined the UN Global Compact in 2003 and adopted the 10 principles, including the principle relating to Human Rights.\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has a Code of Ethics that reflects these commitments. This Charter is available on the Dassault Aviation website and on the Dassault Aviation Intranet; it is always distributed to new hires.\n\nThe Code also pays particular attention to respect for human rights and fundamental labor rights and to the proper application of essential principles:\n\n- non-discrimination on grounds of origin, morals, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political or religious opinions, trade union membership;\n- respect for the individual and his or her private life;\n- maintenance of a safe working environment and conditions (see Section 4.6).\n\nIn accordance with our General Purchasing Conditions, our suppliers and service providers undertake to comply with our Code of Ethics when they execute their orders.\n\nSince 2017, under our purchasing and supply chain security policy, the evaluation procedure for suppliers and sub-contractors has included criteria for evaluating respect for human rights. They are evaluated on the basis of a completed questionnaire, the answers to which will allow Dassault Aviation to decide whether to embark on a business relationship with them.\n\nLastly, the Ethics and Compliance Department handles any reports of violations of the law and international conventions on human rights, as part of its internal whistleblowing procedure.\n\n### **4.8.8. Preventing risks of corruption and upholding business ethics**\n\nIn strict compliance with the recommendations of the French Anti-Corruption Agency, the Group has introduced a system to address the risks of corruption with appropriate measures to prevent and detect, in France and abroad, acts of corruption or influence peddling in accordance with Law 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy.\n\nDassault Aviation has chosen to entrust an independent body, the Ethics and Compliance Department, with the implementation and supervision of the anti-corruption system. This department reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Within the Dassault Aviation Group and its subsidiaries, this department ensures that the Company fulfills its legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Strict business ethics**\n\nThrough its Code of Ethics, the Dassault Aviation Group asserts the values that serve to unite the actions of all its employees. This charter also sets out a code of conduct that the Group applies with its customers, partners, suppliers and sub-contractors. It is supplemented by an anti-corruption code and an anti-corruption guide describing real-life situations that employees might encounter.\n\nObserving a strict code of ethics, the Group commits to acting in accordance with the Convention of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Convention and national laws. The Parent Company takes part in the OECD's Annual Anti-Corruption and Integrity Forum.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to numerous international commitments on the prevention of corruption (Global Compact, Common Industry Standards, Global Principles). It is also a member of several associations and forums on ethical business conduct and corporate responsibility at the national, European and international levels (see website www.dassault-aviation.com, Ethics section). Dassault Aviation is a member of the IFBEC (International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct) and adheres to the standards of the ASD (AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe) with a view to maintaining its anti-corruption system at the highest level.\n\n### **A training policy for all staff**\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department organizes specific training sessions for the managers and personnel most exposed to risks of corruption and influence peddling. The purpose of this training is to give staff the essential tools to detect potential risks and instruct them in the vigilance and behavior required in such situations.\n\nIn line with its 2022 action plan, the Ethics and Compliance Department trained 755 employees in 2023 through 21 sessions dedicated to the Sapin 2 program.\n\nThe content of each session is set in consultation with the Ethics and Compliance Department and the concerned department, with regard to mapping the risks of breaches of probity. These sessions must allow the fundamental principles of the Sapin 2 Law to be acquired based on concrete situations covered by the risk mapping scenarios.\n\nIn addition to longer training sessions for functions considered more at risk with regard to their specific nature (buyers and sellers for example), the Ethics and Compliance Department organizes awareness sessions for less exposed staff. These awareness sessions enable it to reach out to more employees on anti-corruption issues and related corporate policies.\n\nSessions covering other areas relating to business ethics have also been run by the Ethics and Compliance Department. This was the case in particular for sessions covering the GDPR and Duty of Care law. These compliance training sessions have also been proposed to the Group's subsidiaries and overseas offices.\n\nA Sapin 2 e-learning module aimed at all employees was launched during 2023 and has already been used to train 3,033 members of staff. This e-learning module was a fun way of validating the knowledge of all new Company employees.\n\n### **A robust compliance system**\n\nFor many years, the Dassault Aviation Group has implemented strict internal procedures to prevent corruption and ensure the integrity, business ethics and reputation of the Group in its industrial and commercial relations.\n\nPursuant to the law of December 9, 2016 concerning the fight against corruption, the Dassault Aviation Group supplemented and strengthened its process to prevent and detect corruption and influence peddling at the level of both the Parent Company and its subsidiaries under the leadership of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who promotes a zero-tolerance policy.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department is tasked with implementing and auditing procedures related to the fight against corruption and influence peddling. As a result, risk maps on the fight against corruption and influence peddling have been developed and deployed within the Group in consultation with the various operational units and are regularly updated. These risk maps are designed to identify, analyze\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nand prioritize the risks of the Group's exposure to corruption and influence peddling, taking into account internal processes, risks factors, the nature of the civil and military activities, and the geographical areas in which the company operates. These maps serve as the basis for the Group's compliance policy, which led the Dassault Aviation Group to strengthen existing anti-corruption procedures.\n\nIn addition to the Code of Ethics, an Anti-Corruption Code - specifically dedicated to the prevention and fight against corruption - had been updated. This Code defines and illustrates, using practical examples and scenarios, the different types of employee behavior to be proscribed as likely to constitute acts of bribery or influence peddling. It is integrated into the internal rules of Dassault Aviation's various sites. Any violation is therefore punishable.\n\nSince the \"Whistleblower\" law of March 21, 2022, the Internal Whistleblowing Procedure allowing employees and external contractors to report any breach of the Code of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Code has been extended to the reporting of any crime or offense, including human rights abuses. The Ethics and Compliance Department is responsible for receiving and processing internal whistleblowing reports. For this purpose, a dedicated email address with an encryption system guaranteeing confidentiality is available to all employees. In fiscal year 2023, no acts of corruption or influence peddling were brought to the attention of the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\nThe procedures for evaluating the situation of customers, suppliers, sub-contractors and consultants in the light of the risk map have been strengthened. Before the Dassault Aviation Group agrees to do business with them, special committees are tasked with going through the various stages to ensure that they comply with its business ethics.\n\nSpecial internal and external accounting control procedures intended to ensure that the books, ledgers and accounts do not mask acts of corruption or influence peddling are deployed within the Finance Department, thus reinforcing the existing procedures implemented by the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\nThroughout the 2023 fiscal year, the Ethics and Compliance Department performed level 2 controls:\n\n- of evaluation procedures for tier 1 suppliers and sub-contractors, civil aircraft customers and consultants,\n- of accounting procedures in association with the Financial Department,\n- and of gifts relating to the Communication Department.\n\nThese follow-up missions confirmed that evaluation procedures covering the Sapin 2 Law had been put in place and were working.\n\nThe compliance program deployed by Dassault Aviation and its subsidiaries demonstrates our commitment to effectively combating corruption and influence peddling.\n\nA page dedicated to the Ethics and Compliance Department is available on the Parent Company intranet site. This page outlines the company's policy on business ethics, provides details of contacts within the Ethics and Compliance Department, and gives a list of reference documents (in French and English), including the Anti-Corruption Code, the Anti-Corruption Guide and the Internal Whistleblowing Procedure.\n\nA page dedicated to ethics and compliance is also accessible on the Group's website.\n\n### **4.8.9. Promoting the Nation-Army bond**\n\nThe strong historical links between Dassault Aviation and the French Army are part of our Group's DNA. This is reflected in the commitment of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Éric Trappier, who served for several years as an officer of the French Navy's operational reserve and is currently Naval Captain of the French military reserve.\n\nDassault Aviation grants its reservist employees an annual leave of absence of 12 calendar days in respect of their deployment or training activities in the military operational reserve (the minimum legal period is 10 working days).\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nMoreover, in 2023, Dassault Aviation introduced the \"Dassault Defense Academy\" for new managerlevel recruitments: three days of training with high-level conferences and visits to military sites.\n\nFinally, Dassault Aviation is patron of several defense-related institutions and charities, including:\n\n- Ordre de la Libération,\n- Association de la Flamme sous l'Arc de Triomphe,\n- Fondation des Ailes de France,\n- Musée de la Marine,\n- Association pour le Grand Prix de l'École Navale.\n\n### **4.9. Complying with European, national and local regulations**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/12 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background. In the upper left corner, there is a large white number \"9\" stacked on top of the words \"INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE\", also in white. Below the text, there is a white geometric design composed of three cubes connected to each other.\n\nThe main Group entities have regulatory oversight systems that make it possible to identify or anticipate the requirements applicable to their activities and carry out compliance actions when it is necessary.\n\nIn 2023, several major regulatory measures on climate change and sustainability were drafted and published:\n\n- delegated acts on the climate component of the European environmental Taxonomy, and on four other environmental objectives,\n- the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), along with the related ESRS,\n- the \"Fit for 55\" legislative package,\n- a new draft EU directive the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, etc.\n\nTo supplement the regulatory oversight systems put in place, Dassault Aviation participates in activities, studies and work carried out by aerospace organizations. This enables the Group to anticipate the regulations applicable to its activities.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5. DASSAULT AVIATION, Parent Company**\n\n### **5.1. Activities**\n\nThe activities of Dassault Aviation (Parent Company), particularly in the area of programs development, Research & Development, and production, have been presented to you within the framework of the Group's activities.\n\n### **5.2. Results**\n\n### **5.2.1. Order intake**\n\nParent Company order intake in 2023 was **EUR 6,734 million**, compared with EUR 17,860 million in 2022. Export order intake represented 61%.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|          | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Defense  | 5,717 | 15,377 | 8,955  |\n| Export   | 3,059 | 13,855 | 6,109  |\n| France   | 2,658 | 1,522  | 2,846  |\n| Falcon   | 1,017 | 2,483  | 2,119  |\n| Total    | 6,734 | 17,860 | 11,074 |\n| % Export | 61%   | 90%    | 73%    |\n\nThe order intake is composed entirely of firm orders.\n\n### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **Defense order intake** totaled **EUR 5,717 million** compared with EUR 15,377 million in 2022. The **Defense Export figure** was **EUR 3,059 million** in 2023, versus EUR 13,855 million in 2022. In 2022, 92 Rafale were ordered (80 by the United Arab Emirates, 6 by Greece and 6 by Indonesia) compared to 18 Rafale ordered by Indonesia in 2023.\n\nThe **Defense France** share amounted to **EUR 2,658 million** in 2023, compared with EUR 1,522 million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the order for Tranche 5 for 42 Rafale (in 2022, the order relating to Phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator was recorded.)\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, **24 Falcon orders** were recorded, compared with 63 in 2022. Order intake totaled **EUR 1,017 million**, versus EUR 2,483 million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to the decline in the number of Falcon ordered (24 vs. 63 in 2022).\n\n### **5.2.2. Net sales**\n\nNet sales in 2023 totaled **EUR 4,101 million**, versus EUR 6,305 million in 2022. Changes were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|          | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Defense  | 2917  | 4,778 | 5,042 |\n| Export   | 1516  | 3,607 | 4,369 |\n| France   | 1 401 | 1,171 | 673   |\n| Falcon   | 1 184 | 1,527 | 1,316 |\n| Total    | 4 101 | 6,305 | 6,358 |\n| % Export | 64%   | 81%   | 88%   |\n\n#### **Defense programs**\n\n**13 Rafale (11 France and 2 Export)** were delivered. 14 Rafale (13 Export and 1 France) were delivered in 2022.\n\n**Defense net sales** in 2023 were **EUR 2,917 million** versus EUR 4,778 million in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense Export** share was **EUR 1,516 million** versus EUR 3,607 million in 2022. This decrease is largely due to the delivery of 2 Rafale Export, whereas 13 Rafale Export were delivered in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense France** share was **EUR 1,401 million** versus EUR 1,171 million in 2022. Defense France 2023 net sales notably included the delivery of 11 Rafale versus 1 Rafale in 2022.\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\n**24 Falcon** were delivered in 2023, compared with 33 in 2022.\n\n**Falcon net sales** in 2023 totaled **EUR 1,184 million**, versus EUR 1,527 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the number of Falcon aircraft delivered (24 vs. 33).\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.2.3. Backlog**\n\nThe backlog of the Parent Company as of December 31, 2023 was **EUR 33,926 million**, compared with EUR 31,237 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\n| As of December 31 |        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Defense           |        | 30,021 | 27,222 | 16,623 |\n|                   | Export | 21,062 | 19,519 | 9,271  |\n|                   | France | 8,959  | 7,703  | 7,352  |\n| Falcon            |        | 3,905  | 4,015  | 2,859  |\n| Total             |        | 33,926 | 31,237 | 19,482 |\n| % Export          |        | 70%    | 71%    | 57%    |\n\nThe **backlog** as of December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\n\n- **Defense Export**: **EUR 21,062 million** versus EUR 19,519 million as of December 31, 2022.

It includes 84 Falcon, same as of December 31, 2022.\n\n### **5.2.4. Net income**\n\nNet income for 2023 was **EUR 435 million**, compared to EUR 540 million in 2022.\n\nIn 2024, employees will receive EUR 134 million on 2023 profit-sharing and incentive plans (excluding related tax), of which :\n\n- profit-sharing: EUR 114 million\n- incentive plan: EUR 20 million\n\nThese figures account for 22% of salaries in 2023. The application of the legal mandatory profit-sharing formula would have resulted in a payment for 2023 of EUR 6 million.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.2.5. Allocation of earnings**\n\nIf you approve the accounts for fiscal year 2023, we propose that you allocate the net earnings for the year of EUR 434,959,208.73, plus retained earnings from previous fiscal years, i.e., EUR 3,174,775,282.36, less the dividends applied to shares other than treasury shares(\\*), to the retained earnings balance.\n\n(\\*) The amount of dividends which, in accordance with the provisions of the fourth paragraph of Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code, may not be paid to the treasury shares held by the Company, will be reallocated to the retained earnings account.\n\n### **5.2.6. Five-year summary**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation five-year summary is shown in Note 32 to the annual financial statements.\n\n### **5.2.7. Tax consolidation**\n\nOur Company opted for the tax consolidation scheme in 1999. As of January 1, 2012, the tax consolidation scope of the Group includes Dassault Aviation, Dassault Aéro Service and Dassault Aviation Participations. A tax integration agreement, tacitly renewable for five-year periods, was signed with these companies.\n\n### **5.3. Risk management**\n\nThe risks and uncertainties to which the Company is exposed are the same as those outlined regarding the Group in Section 2 \"Risk factors\" above, since the Parent Company plays a predominant role within the scope of consolidation.\n\n### **5.4. Terms of payment**\n\nIn application of the law, Dassault Aviation implemented the necessary procedures to assure payment to its suppliers at EOM (End-Of-Month) +45 days. The composition of unpaid past-due supplier invoices received by the balance sheet date was as follows (in millions of euros, VAT excluded):\n\n| Late payment tranches                          | 1 to<br>30 days | 31 to<br>60 days | 61 to<br>90 days | 91 days<br>and<br>over | Total |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|-------|\n| Number of invoices involved                    |                 |                  | 1,884(*)         |                        |       |\n| Total amount of invoices involved (before VAT) | 10.9            | 5.9              |                  |                        | 16.8  |\n| % of FY net sales (before VAT)                 | 0.26%           | 0.14%            |                  |                        | 0.40% |\n\n*(\\*) 3,268 invoices for EUR 30 million excluded as related to disputes* Contractual payment terms: EOM + 45 days.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe composition as of December 31, 2023 of unpaid past-due invoices issued by the closing date was as follows (in millions of euros, VAT excluded):\n\n| Late payment tranches                          | 1 to<br>30 days | 31 to<br>60 days | 61 to<br>90 days | 91 days<br>and over | Total |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|\n| Number of invoices involved                    |                 |                  | 8,929            |                     |       |\n| Total amount of invoices involved (before VAT) | 119.6           | 27.8             | 44.5             | 116.5               | 308.4 |\n| % of FY net sales (before VAT)                 | 2.92%           | 0.68%            | 1.08%            | 2.84%               | 7.52% |\n\nPayment terms: defined in the General Purchasing Conditions\n\n### **5.5. Shareholder information**\n\n### **5.5.1. Capital structure**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the share capital of the Company is EUR 64,641,892.80. It is divided into 80,802,366 shares, each with a par value of EUR 0.80.\n\nThe shares are listed on the regulated \"Euronext Paris\" market in Compartment A, International Securities Identification Number (ISIN): FR0014004L86. They are eligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (SRD). Following the increase in its free float, in 2016 Dassault Aviation joined the following stock market indices: Sociétés des Bourses Françaises 120 (SBF 120) and the Morgan Stanley Capital International World (MSCI World).\n\nPursuant to Law No. 2014-384 of March 29, 2014, seeking to reconquer the real economy, and since April 3, 2016, shares issued by the Company and held in a registered account for two years or more are entitled to double voting rights.\n\nThe Company's bylaws do not include any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or on the transfer of shares.\n\nSince the General Meeting of May 20, 2015, there has been a statutory obligation to provide information on the crossing of ownership thresholds. This applies to any fraction held that is equal to or greater than 1% of the capital and voting rights of the Company, and any multiple of that percentage, which exceeds or falls below those thresholds. A proposal will be made to the next General Meeting to amend this statutory clause to remove the obligation to declare the 1% crossing of ownership thresholds beyond 50%.\n\nNo shareholder has special control rights. In particular, there is no shareholding system offering employees specific control.\n\n| Shareholders        | Number of shares | %       | Exercisable voting<br>rights(2) | %       |\n|---------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| GIMD                | 51,960,760       | 64.31%  | 103,921,520                     | 79.26%  |\n| Float               | 18,786,539       | 23.25%  | 18,922,456                      | 14.43%  |\n| Airbus SE           | 8,275,290        | 10.24%  | 8,275,290                       | 6.31%   |\n| Treasury shares (1) | 1,779,777        | 2.20%   | 0                               | 0.00%   |\n| TOTAL               | 80,802,366       | 100.00% | 131,119,266                     | 100.00% |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the shareholding of Dassault Aviation is as follows:\n\n(1) shares recorded in the \"fully registered shares\" account, without voting rights.\n\n(2) Pursuant to the \"Florange\" Law, and in the absence of contrary provisions in the bylaws of Dassault Aviation, shares held in a registered account for more than two years are entitled to double voting rights.\n\nDirect or indirect shareholdings in the Company of which it is aware, pursuant to Articles L. 233- 7 and L. 233-12 of the French Commercial Code, are shown in the table above.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, 24,600 shares (0.03% of the capital) were held by one of the corporate investment funds whose members are current or former employees of the Company.\n\n### **5.5.2. Information on capital, shareholders and voting rights**\n\nThe General Meeting has not agreed to delegate any authority or powers to the Board of Directors regarding capital increases.\n\nThe Company has not issued any securities representative of its current capital.\n\nThe Company did not create any stock options in 2023.\n\nThe General Meeting of May 11, 2021 authorized the Board of Directors to allocate, in one or more stages, free existing shares of the Company (to the benefit of Company employees or certain employee categories it may determine, and to the benefit of eligible corporate officers of the Company).\n\nThis authorization, valid for a period of 38 months from the General Meeting, concerned a maximum of 278,000 shares (1) representing 0.33% of the capital as of May 11, 2021. It states that the Board of Directors shall determine the identity of the beneficiaries of such allocations and, as required, the conditions and the criteria for allocating the shares, as well as the vesting and lock-in period of those shares.\n\n(1) proforma, following the 10-for-1 stock split\n\nPursuant to this authorization (see Table 6 of the Report on Corporate Governance), on March 8, 2023 the Board of Directors decided to award 23,000 performance shares to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 16,900 performance shares to the Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThese shares will become vested (between 0% and 128%) provided the following performance criteria are met:\n\n- adjusted Group operating margin,\n- two aspects of corporate social responsibility, namely:\n\t- o feminization,\n\t- o the low-carbon plan,\n- qualitative assessment of individual performance.\n\nIn addition, the same Board Meeting defined the following other conditions:\n\n- a one-year vesting period, ending on March 7, 2024 (evening),\n- presence in the workforce at the end of the vesting period,\n- a one-year holding period for beneficiaries, starting from March 8, 2024, and ending March 7, 2025,\n- from March 8, 2025, the retention of 20% of those shares for the duration of their term of office.\n\nA proposal will be made to the next General Meeting to approve a new delegation of powers to the Board of Directors to allocate free existing shares of the Company (to the benefit of Company employees or certain employee categories it may determine, and to the benefit of eligible corporate officers of the Company).\n\n### **5.5.3. Securities transactions by corporate officers**\n\nThe securities transactions executed in 2023 by corporate officers consisted of the acquisition of performance shares voted by the Board of Directors on March 8, 2023 (see Report on Corporate Governance).\n\nNo other acquisition or sale of Dassault Aviation shares was declared by corporate officers to the Company or to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*). Such transactions, when they occur and subject to their amount, must be reported to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) and the Company, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 223-22-A et seq. of the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) General Regulation.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.5.4. Shareholders' agreements**\n\nThere is no shareholders' agreement between Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault (GIMD) and Airbus SE.\n\nHowever, the following two agreements are in place:\n\n### **Agreement between the French government, Airbus SE and Airbus SAS**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 233-11 of the French Commercial Code, the Company has been informed by the French Commissioner of State Holdings that on June 21, 2013, the French government signed a shareholders' agreement with Airbus SE and Airbus SAS that established concerted action with respect to Dassault Aviation. This agreement provides as follows:\n\n- Airbus may exercise its voting rights in General Meetings following consultation with the French government,\n- the French government is granted the right of first refusal and the right of first offer should Airbus seek to dispose of all or part of its shares in the stock of Dassault Aviation.\n\nAirbus SE, which also signed the agreement, is bound by these commitments.\n\n### **Agreement between the French Government and GIMD**\n\nIn application of Article L. 233-11 of the French Commercial Code, the Company was informed by GIMD that, on November 28, 2014, the French Government signed an agreement with GIMD, which would enter into force on December 2, 2014. The purpose of this agreement is to confer on the French Government preemptive rights in case of transfer of Dassault Aviation shares by GIMD that would drop below the 40% threshold in Dassault Aviation capital, and in case of any subsequent shares transfers below this threshold.\n\nThis agreement does not constitute a concerted action between the French government and GIMD, each remaining at total liberty to manage its shareholding and exercise its voting rights.\n\nThese two agreements have no impact on the Company's governance.\n\nGIMD holds the majority of the capital and voting rights in Dassault Aviation.\n\n### **5.5.5. Treasury shares**\n\n### **Share buyback programs**\n\nThe share buyback program voted by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and implemented by the Board of Directors on July 20, 2022 continued into the first half of 2023.\n\nTo allow Dassault Aviation to continue to trade its own shares on the market or off-market, the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 authorized a new share buyback program, identical to those implemented since 2014, under similar conditions to the 2022 program. At its meeting of May 16, 2023, the Board of Directors implemented the new share buyback program and delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to conduct any transaction under the conditions set by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis new authorization, valid for a period of 18 months as of May 16, 2023 (until November 15, 2024 inclusive), terminates, at this date, the share buyback program previously authorized by the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2022, for the unused portion of that program.\n\nThis share buyback program is in compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and European Regulation 596/2014 of April 16, 2014.\n\nThis share buyback authorization may be used by the Board of Directors for the following objectives:\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n- to cancel shares in order to increase the profitability of shareholders' equity and earnings per share,\n- to transfer or allocate shares to employees and corporate officers of the Company and/or of affiliated companies under the terms and conditions stipulated by law, particularly in case of the exercising of stock options or allocating existing free shares, or transferring and/or subscribing for existing shares as part as an employee stock ownership scheme,\n- to stimulate market activity or increase the liquidity of Dassault Aviation shares through an investment services provider under a liquidity contract compliant with an ethics charter recognized by the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers),\n- to retain the shares with a view to subsequent use, to remit them as payment or in exchange, including as part of any external growth transactions, for up to 5% of the share capital,\n- to remit the shares upon exercise of rights attached to debt securities convertible to Dassault Aviation shares,\n- to implement any market practice that would be recognized by the law or by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*).\n\nThe acquisition, disposal or transfer of shares as described above may be carried out by any means compatible with applicable law and regulations, including as part of a negotiated trade.\n\nThe authorization given by the General Meeting on May 16, 2023, to the Board of Directors entitles Dassault Aviation to buy its own shares, up to a limit of 10% of its capital, for a unit price capped at EUR 200 exclusive of acquisition costs (compared with EUR 170 in 2022), subject to adjustments linked to corporate actions, particularly through the incorporation of reserves and the allocation of free shares and/or stock split or reverse stock split.\n\nThe maximum amount to be used to buy back the Company's shares is EUR 1,661,559,000 based on the number of shares outstanding on the date of the decision; this condition is combined with the condition for a 10% cap on the Company's capital.\n\nThe General Meeting conferred all powers to the Board of Directors, with an option to subdelegate in the cases authorized by the law, to decide to act on this authorization, place any stock market or offmarket orders, sign any agreements, draw up any documents including information documents, set the terms for the Company's market or off-market dealings, as well as the terms and conditions for acquisition and disposal of shares, file any declarations, including to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*), set the terms and conditions protecting, where necessary, the rights of the holders of securities giving access to the capital, of options to subscribe for or buy shares, or of rights to allocate performance shares in accordance with legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, fulfill any formalities and, in general, do whatever is necessary to complete such transactions.\n\nThe General Meeting also conferred all powers to the Board of Directors if the law or the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) were to extend or add to the objectives authorized for the share buyback program, in order to bring to public attention, within applicable legal and regulatory terms and conditions, any amendments with regard to the program's objectives.\n\nThe buyback by Dassault Aviation of its own shares in 2023 related to:\n\n- 556,179 shares acquired between January 1, 2023 and May 16, 2023 under the share buyback program voted by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022,\n- 3,257,124 shares acquired between May 17, 2023 and December 31, 2023 under the program voted by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023,\n\nIn 2023, these 3,813,303 shares (4.72% of the share capital at December 31, 2023) were acquired at an average share price of EUR 173.16, or a cumulative gross amount of EUR 660,311,989. Trading fees amounted to EUR 462,218.\n\nTaking into account the allocation in 2023 of a total of 38,364 shares (0.05% of the share capital) to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to the Chief Operating Officer as 2022 performance shares, the balance of shares acquired under a previous buyback program and set aside for the distribution of performance shares and the potential arrangement of a liquidity contract to stimulate the market or ensure the liquidity of the stock through an investment service provider was 242,066 shares.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to allow the Company to trade in its own shares at any time, on March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting of May 16, 2024, that a new share buyback program be launched with a maximum price per share fixed at EUR 220, other conditions remaining unchanged (Resolution 14).\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 225-211 and R. 225-160 of the French Commercial Code, the Company maintains registers of the purchase and sale of shares acquired and sold in the context of its share buyback programs.\n\n### **Cancellation of shares through a capital reduction**\n\nUnder the authorization given by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022, the Board of Directors in its March 8, 2023 meeting canceled 409,072 shares (0.49% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and which had been allocated for cancellation.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the General Meeting authorized the Board of Directors, on the same terms as the authorizations granted since 2019, to:\n\n- reduce its share capital by way of cancellation, in one or more stages, of all or some of the shares acquired by the Company under a share buyback program, limited to 10% of the capital per 24 month period,\n- allocate the difference between the buyback value of canceled shares and their nominal value to premiums and available reserves.\n\nTo this end, the General Meeting has granted all powers to the Board of Directors to set the terms and conditions for any capital reductions consecutive to any cancellation operations decided upon.\n\nThis authorization was given for a period that expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nUnder this new authorization, the Board of Directors decided to cancel:\n\n- on May 16, 2023, 556,179 shares (0.67% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and which had been allocated for cancellation,\n- on July 20, 2023, 1,719,413 shares (2.08% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 and which had been allocated for cancellation.\n\nIn order to allow the Company to reduce its share capital at any time, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of March 5, 2024, recommends to the General Meeting of May 16, 2024 that it authorize the Board to reduce the Company's share capital by the cancellation of shares purchased or to be purchased under a share buyback program (Resolution 15).\n\n### **Treasury shares as at December 31, 2023**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held 1,779,777 of its own shares (2.20% of the share capital) with a par value of EUR 0.80, for a gross purchase value of EUR 295,451,233.\n\nOf these 1,779,777 shares, 242,066 were allocated for the distribution of performance shares and the potential arrangement of a liquidity contract and 1,537,711 shares were allocated for cancellation.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.5.6. Significant agreements entered into by the Company**\n\nThe Company did not enter into any major agreement that would be amended or automatically terminated in the event of a change in control of the Company.\n\nHowever, in such a case, the National Defense contracts entered into with the French government would be reexamined by the French Ministry of Defense, which could require that all or some of these contracts be transferred to another French company for reasons of national interest.\n\nThere is no agreement offering compensation for:\n\n- members of the Board of Directors, should they resign or be dismissed,\n- for employees, should they resign or are dismissed without real and serious cause or if their employment is terminated due to a public tender offer, beyond the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **6. PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS**\n\nThe resolutions submitted to your vote concern the following points:\n\n### **6.1. Resolutions for the Ordinary General Meeting**\n\n### **Approval of company and consolidated financial statements**\n\nFirst of all, you are asked to approve the annual financial statements of the Parent Company (Resolution 1), which show a net profit of EUR 434,959,208.73, and the consolidated financial statements, which show a consolidated net profit of EUR 693,398 thousand for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (Resolution 2).\n\nThose financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024 after prior examination by the Audit Committee. They were the subject of unqualified opinions from the Statutory Auditors, which can be found in the 2023 Annual Report.\n\n### **Allocation and distribution of the net income of the Parent Company**\n\nIt is proposed that net income for the fiscal year, plus the retained earnings from prior years, which constitute a total distributable amount of EUR 3,609,734,491.09, be allocated for the distribution of a dividend for fiscal year 2023 in the amount of EUR 3.37 per share, with the remaining balance to retained earnings (Resolution 3).\n\nThe dividend would be paid on May 22, 2024.\n\n### **Approval of the elements of compensation paid or allocated for fiscal year 2023**\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-34 I and L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, you are asked to approve the elements of compensation of all directors, mentioned in Article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code (Resolution 4), as well as the aforementioned elements concerning the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Éric Trappier, and the Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Loïk Segalen (Resolutions 5 and 6), for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThese items are presented in paragraph 2.1 of the Report on Corporate Governance.\n\n### **Approval of the 2024 compensation policy**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors submits for the approval of the Annual General Meeting the 2024 compensation policy for directors (Resolution 7), for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Resolution 8), and for the Chief Operating Officer (Resolution 9).\n\nThese elements were agreed by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024 and are presented in paragraph 2.2 of the Report on Corporate Governance.\n\n### **Re-election of a director**\n\nThe term of office of Besma Boumaza expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting. You are asked to renew this term of office for a period of four years, i.e., until after the Annual General Meeting called in 2028 to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 (Resolution 10).\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appointment of Mazars and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit as joint sustainability auditors**\n\nThe Directive EU No 2022/2464 (\"CSRD\"), enacted into French law by Order (\"Ordonnance\") No 2023- 1142 dated December 6, 2023, provides for the introduction as of 2025 (relating to the 2024 financial statements) of a sustainability report to replace the Non-Financial Performance Declaration.\n\nThis sustainability report must be certified by one or more sustainability auditors who may be appointed from among the Company's Statutory Auditors or external firms. These sustainability auditors are appointed by the General Meeting upon recommendation by the Board of Directors.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Board of Directors, based on the advice of the Audit Committee, you are asked to approve the appointment of Mazars and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, the Company's current joint Statutory Auditors, as joint sustainability auditors for a period equivalent to that of their term of office as Statutory Auditors, i.e., until the end of the Annual General Meeting called in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the 2025 fiscal year (Resolutions 11 and 12).\n\n### **Approval of the related-party agreement for the acquisition by Dassault Aviation of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes from GIMD**\n\nAfter having reviewed the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements referred to in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the Annual General Meeting is called upon to approve the agreement concerning the acquisition by Dassault Aviation of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes (92) from GIMD.\n\nThis agreement was authorized by the Board of Directors at its meeting on March 8, 2023.\n\nThis acquisition was completed on June 27, 2023 for a total amount of EUR 25.24 million (excluding taxes and charges) (Resolution 13).\n\n### **Authorization to be given to the Board of Directors to allow the Company to purchase its own shares under a share buyback program**\n\nCompanies whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market are allowed to purchase their own shares if they are authorized by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nUnder Article L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the provisions of European Regulation 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, we ask you to reauthorize the Board of Directors to implement a share buyback program for a period of 18 months (Resolution 14).\n\nThe share buyback program would enable the Company:\n\n- 1) to cancel shares in order to increase the return on equity and earnings per share (subject to adopting Resolution 15),\n- 2) to transfer or allocate shares to employees and corporate officers of the Company and/or of affiliated companies under the terms and conditions stipulated by law, particularly in case of the exercising of stock options or allocation of existing free shares, or transferring and/or subscribing for existing shares as part as an employee stock ownership scheme,\n- 3) to stimulate market activity or increase the liquidity of Dassault Aviation shares through an investment services provider under a share liquidity contract compliant with an ethics charter recognized by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*),\n- 4) to retain the shares with a view to subsequent use, to remit them as payment or in exchange, including as part of any external growth transactions, for up to 5% of the share capital,\n- 5) to remit the shares upon exercise of rights attached to debt securities convertible to Dassault Aviation shares,\n- 6) to implement any market practice that would be recognized by the law or by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*).\n\nThe Board could proceed with the buyback of Dassault Aviation shares within the legal limit of 10% of the Dassault Aviation share capital.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe maximum buyback price would be EUR 220 per share exclusive of acquisition costs (compared with EUR 200 in 2023). Considering the number of shares of the capital as of December 31, 2023, decreased by the number of shares canceled through the capital reduction decided by the Board of March 5, 2024, the maximum number of shares possibly acquired is 7,895,181, i.e. a maximum investment of EUR 1,736,939,820, this condition being combined with the condition of a cap of 10% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThis authorization would take effect at the next meeting of the Board of Directors which would decide whether to implement the new share buyback program, on which date the unused portion of the share buyback program previously authorized by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 would be terminated.\n\n### **6.2. Resolutions for the Extraordinary General Meeting**\n\n### **Authorization to be given to the Board of Directors to reduce the Company's share capital by cancellation of shares purchased or to be purchased under the scope of a share buyback program**\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting is asked to authorize the Board of Directors, with the option of sub-delegation, to:\n\n- reduce its share capital by way of cancellation, in one or more stages, of all or some of the shares acquired by the Company under a share buyback program, limited to 10% of the share capital per 24-month period,\n- allocate the difference between the buyback value of canceled shares and their nominal value to premiums and available reserves.\n\nThis new authorization would be granted for a period that expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Resolution 15).\n\nAs of May 16, 2024, it would render the similar authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2023 ineffective for the unused portion.\n\n### **Authorization to be granted to the Board of Directors to allocate free shares of the Company to corporate officers and certain Company employees**\n\nThe authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the General Meeting of May 11, 2021 to allocate existing performance shares of the Company, to Company employees or certain employee categories and to the Company's eligible corporate officers, will expire on July 11, 2024.\n\nThe General Meeting is asked to renew this authorization (Resolution 16).\n\nThis allocation would be made within the limit of 242,066 shares (shares yet to be allocated).\n\nThis new authorization is proposed under similar terms to those currently in force.\n\nIt would be approved for a period of 38 months as of the General Meeting and would render ineffective, for the unused part, the authorization of the same nature approved by the General Meeting on May 11, 2021.\n\n### **Amendment of Article 11 of the Company's Articles of Association relating to the crossing of statutory thresholds**\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association provide for an obligation to provide information on the crossing of ownership thresholds. This applies to any fraction held that is equal to or greater than 1% of the capital and voting rights of the Company, and any multiple of that percentage, which exceeds or falls below those thresholds.\n\nDue to the shareholding structure, this provision is not of interest for fractions of 1% which exceed or fall below the ownership thresholds, beyond 50%.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result, a proposal is made to the next General Meeting to amend this statutory clause to remove the obligation to declare 1% crossing of ownership thresholds beyond 50% (Resolution°17).\n\nThe declaration of legal threshold crossings remains mandatory in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\n### **Miscellaneous amendments to the Company's Articles of Association to bring them into line with legal and regulatory provisions**\n\nIn view of the amendment proposed in the previous Resolution, we recommend that the Articles of Association be brought into line with legal and regulatory changes (Resolution 18).\n\nFor simplification purposes, certain amended articles simply refer to the legal and regulatory texts in force.\n\nThese amendments mainly relate to:\n\n- the persons authorized to certify copies or extracts of minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors (Article 17 of the Articles of Association),\n- the removal of reference to directors' fees which no longer exists in the French Commercial Code (Articles 22 and 32),\n- the Article relating to related-party agreements due to the disappearance of super-regulated agreements on deferred compensation at the end of terms of office which has been included in the Say on Pay policy (Article 24),\n- the share registration deadline to be able to take part in General Meetings which has been reduced to two days before the meeting (Article 29),\n- the deadline for sending voting forms by mail (Articles 31, 33 and 34),\n- majority rules at General Meetings which are calculated on the basis of votes cast (Articles 33 and 34).\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **7. OUTLOOK**\n\n2024 Objectives:\n\n- Deliver Rafale and Falcon,\n- Meet our schedule and cost commitments for Falcon and military developments,\n- Availability and support for our aircraft: maintain satisfaction levels among our military customers and regain our position as leader in business aviation support rankings,\n- Get a contract for the F5 standard preliminary studies,\n- FCAS/NGF: continue developing the demonstrator,\n- Make in India: ramp up the activities transferred to India,\n- Continue Rafale Export business development and increase Falcon sales efforts,\n- CSR: integrate new hires, continue our recruitment efforts and our action to reduce our environmental impact.\n\n### **2024 Guidance**\n\nWe forecast an increase in Group's revenue for 2024 compared to 2023, EUR 6 Billion range (of which deliveries of 35 Falcon and 20 Rafale).\n\n*This Directors' Report may contain forward-looking statements which represent objectives and cannot be construed as forecasts regarding the Group's results or any other performance indicator. The actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in this report.*\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appendix to the Directors' Report**\n\n### **Indicators**\n\nIn accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 and Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, the Directors' Report includes a non-financial performance declaration (NFPD) containing the following information:\n\n- Social information,\n- Environmental information,\n- Information relating to respect for Human Rights,\n- Information relating to the fight against corruption,\n- Information relating to the fight against tax avoidance.\n\n### **Scope of consolidation of the non-financial performance declaration**\n\nThe scope of the NFPD is based on the financial consolidation scope. However, due to restricted activity and/or workforce or the absence of control by Dassault Aviation, some subsidiaries have not been included. Therefore, the following were excluded:\n\n- Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd, Thales, Falcon Training Center and Aero Precision Repair & Overhaul Co., Inc., in which Dassault Aviation's stake is 50% or less,\n- Dassault Falcon Jet Leasing Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Falcon Jet Corporation), Dassault Falcon Jet Wilmington and ExecuJet MRO Services Middle East LLC, which had no significant CSR activity.\n\n### **Audit and consolidation of the NFPD**\n\nEach published indicator is subject to a reporting protocol detailing the definition of the indicator, the scope and the calculation methodology. Indicators are calculated on the basis of a calendar year (from January 1 to December 31).\n\nTaking into account the mode of data gathering and the locations of the subsidiaries, the reporting scope may vary according to the indicators. Certain indicators cannot be consolidated due to the differences in regulations between the countries.\n\nUnder the framework of ISO 14001 certification, reporting procedures for environmental indicators are applied by the Parent Company.\n\n### **Social and Human Resources Data**\n\nThe NFPD includes Dassault Aviation's policy on gender equality and equal pay, which the Board of Directors is required to deliberate under Article L. 225-37-1 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe social data of this report is based on fact sheets and methodology sheets that form the reference base for reporting social data of the Dassault Aviation Group, in force in 2023. The defined indicators are in compliance with national regulations.\n\nThe following details are given for the following indicators:\n\n- Employment:\n\t- o Registered headcount: all employees registered in the workforce as of December 31, regardless of the duration and nature of their employment contract (CDI, CDD, professional training contracts and apprentices). The departures on December 31, temporary workers, interns and subcontractors are excluded from this count.\n\t- o Active headcount: registered headcount less suspended contracts (sabbatical leave, business creation leave, other unpaid leave, uncompensated illnesses, disabilities, parental leave, endof-career leave) and professionalization and apprenticeship contracts.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n- absenteeism: the causes of absences taken into account for the absenteeism indicator are sickness, stoppages for work-related accidents and accidents when traveling to/from work, and unjustified absences. The indicated number of days are normal working days,\n- departures and dismissals: contractual terminations are to be counted as departures but are not counted within the number of dismissals,\n- Group compensation: the average annual compensation is a gross compensation that includes the base salary, the 13th month and the seniority bonus, excluding other bonuses,\n- Parent Company compensation: the average annual compensation is a gross figure that includes the base salary, the 13th month and the seniority bonus, excluding other bonuses, plus profitsharing and incentive schemes,\n- training hours: work-study training hours recorded in the training plan as well as the in-school training hours of professional development contracts are also taken into account. Training hours in the workplace are also taken into account when they are part of a training program with precise formal monitoring.\n\nConcerning the e-learning, only the hours of completed training are taken into account (status completed and/or validated in the *Learning Management System*, recording of the hours spent and of the training in SAP or issuance of a certificate at the end of the training provided that a minimum score is obtained on the end-of-training test).\n\nConcerning the English training at Dassault Aviation, the hours recorded correspond to the theoretical contractual hours. Reminders are sent to employees in order to encourage them to follow the training hours granted to them.\n\nGiven the management tools available to Dassault Aviation and given the closing deadlines, the Parent Company is not able to capture all of the sessions. Therefore, only 96% of the training sessions could be captured. The group continues to work on tools and processes to reduce the number of uncaptured sessions.\n\n### **Environmental Data**\n\nThe environmental indicators and the associated generation methods are subject to descriptive methodological procedures both for the Parent Company and for its subsidiaries.\n\nThese procedures are included in the documentation repository of the Parent Company and distributed to the various entities contributing to the generation of these indicators.\n\nThe year 2020, disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis, is not representative of the Company's activities. The year 2019 was therefore chosen as the reference year. In addition, the reporting of subsidiaries DABS and Execujet has only been effective since 2020, year of their integration into the Group.\n\nChanges in environmental indicators having as reference the year 2019 are therefore only available on the consolidated scope Parent Company, DFS, Sogitec and DFJ.\n\nThe balances are produced per calendar year and consolidated, when the data so allows, against invoices and meter readings for the period from January to December. Unavailable information relating to the last months of the year is estimated by comparison with the equivalent months of the previous year or based on the average for the same month of the last three years, or by any other relevant method due to the unrepresentativeness of data for 2020 and 2021, which were disrupted by Covid-19.\n\nThe data for year n-1, estimated at the time of publication of that financial year, are likely to change in the publication of the report for year n, after receiving the actual data.\n\nThe consumption of kerosene for maintenance activities is calculated on the basis of the purchased, non-reinvoiced fuel.\n\nThe consumption of kerosene for production activities includes both civil and military aircraft.\n\nAs no calculation method has proven to be sufficiently robust, the scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions item relating to upstream and downstream transport is not the subject of a quantitative publication this year. Work is ongoing to collect data from transportation providers.\n\nScope 3 sources of greenhouse gas emissions were analyzed and retained in the non-financial performance declaration if they were assessed as significant, or as non-significant but with accessible decarbonization levers.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Information relating to respect for Human Rights**\n\nDassault Aviation is committed to respecting human rights through its Code of Ethics, internal organization, the evaluation and monitoring of its suppliers, and the various international texts we adhere to. The measures taken to further this commitment are detailed in Section 4.8.\n\n#### **Information relating to the fight against corruption**\n\nIn accordance with Article 17 of Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 respecting transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernization of economic life, Dassault Aviation takes measures to prevent and detect, in France and abroad, acts of corruption or influence peddling.\n\n#### **Information relating to the fight against tax avoidance**\n\nDassault Aviation complies with the tax regulations in force and, as such, pays taxes in the countries in which it operates its industrial activity.\n\n#### **External Verification**\n\nThe non-financial data contained in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration and the methods used to compile and validate the data were subjected to an external audit by the independent third party Mazars.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n- corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1. Concerning certain risks, such as those relating to traceability and obsolescence of hazardous substances, supply chain: customer duty and ethical business conduct, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n- we verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16;\n- we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the company and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:\n\t- analytical procedures that consisted in verifying the correct consolidation of collected data as well as the consistency of changes thereto;\n\t- substantive tests, on a sample basis and using other selection methods, that consisted in verifying the proper application of definitions and procedures and reconciling data with supporting documents. These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities and covered between 29% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests.\n- we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less extensive than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nIndependent third-party\n\nMazars\n\nErwan Candau Partner\n\nSouad El Ouazzani CSR & Sustainable Development Partner\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appendix 1: The most important information**\n\n| Issues                                              | Key performance indicator                    | Assurance level    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Traceability and hazardous substances' obsolescence | Number of hazardous products substituted     |                    |\n| Employment and skills                               | Workforce                                    |                    |\n|                                                     | Percentage of employees trained              |                    |\n| Health, safety and working conditions               | Frequency rate of work-related accidents     |                    |\n|                                                     | Severity rate of accidents at work           | Limited assurance. |\n| Climate changes                                     | Energy consumption by source                 |                    |\n|                                                     | Greenhouse gas emissions, scopes 1 and 2     |                    |\n| Supply Chain : customer duty                        | Percentage of new supplier assessed          |                    |\n|                                                     | Percentage of suppliers with potential risks |                    |\n| Ethical business conduct                            | Number of corruption                         |                    |\n|                                                     | Number of training offered                   |                    |\n|                                                     | Number of employees trained                  |                    |\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking readers.

The Legal Affairs and Insurance Department and the Financial Department carried out preparatory checks on the drafting of said report, which was then reviewed by the Statutory Auditors as part of their due diligence and approved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **1. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**\n\n### **1.1. Corporate governance guidelines**\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-10 4° of the French Commercial Code, Dassault Aviation decided in 2021, after reviewing the provisions of the current corporate governance codes issued by AFEP-MEDEF and Middlenext, that those codes do not constitute its corporate governance guidelines.\n\n- The Company does not refer to the aforementioned codes as a result of its specific situation and in particular due to:\n\t- the family nature of its shareholding structure since its beginning, with a majority of the shares held by GIMD, a company owned by the Dassault family, which is a full-fledged stakeholder in the Company's strategic choices,\n\t- its uniqueness, which is the distinctive feature of Dassault Aviation's pioneering role in the implementation of certain practices, especially in the area of labor relations, such as paid vacations and profit-sharing and incentive schemes,\n\t- its simple, centralized and reactive organization,\n\t- its story marked by the high stability of its management team, with five Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers since the post-war period, in line with the long cycles specific to its industry sector,\n\t- a rigorous culture that guides its operations on a day-to-day basis.\n- The Company's governance is based on the following principles:\n\t- the desire to foster a stable shareholding structure, reflecting its nature as a family business with long-term shareholder investment,\n\t- a skilled, experienced Board of Directors with in-depth knowledge of the business,\n\t- the striving for balance on the Board of Directors, with members from the family circle, independent directors and a director representing employees,\n\t- the ambition for diversity and gender parity in the composition of the Board of Directors, with balanced representation of women and men on the Board of Directors,\n\t- the transparency of the corporate officers' compensation.\n\nFurthermore, Dassault Aviation has decided to adopt a certain number of governance rules in addition to the legal requirements:\n\n- the Board of Directors' internal regulations posted on the Company's website [\\(www.dassault](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/)[aviation.com\\)](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/), which specifies the operating rules governing the Board of Directors,\n- a specific definition of independence (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the introduction of specific rules concerning the identification and prevention of conflicts of interest on the Board of Directors, supplementing the Internal Charter on related-party agreements (see paragraph 1.4 \"Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the staggered renewal of directors' terms of office (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- detailed information communicated to shareholders when Directors are appointed or reappointed (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the ownership by each director of a minimum number of shares to be retained as registered shares throughout his or her term of office (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- a reminder to directors of the qualities required and of the rules of professional ethics for the performance of their duties (this information is available in the Board of Directors' internal regulations available on the Company's website [www.dassault-aviation.com\\)](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/),\n- a minimum of two meetings per year of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, given the Group's long business cycles (see paragraph 1.4 \"Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the suspension of the employment contracts of corporate officers.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nLastly, with regard to the executive corporate officers' compensation, the Company applies all provisions of the laws in force.\n\n### **1.2. Composition of the Board of Directors**\n\nAs of the date of this report, the Board of Directors is composed of eight members with the experience and expertise required to fulfill their office: Éric Trappier (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and Charles Edelstenne (Honorary Chairman), Besma Boumaza, Marie-Hélène Habert and Lucia Sinapi-Thomas, Thierry Dassault, Henri Proglio and Stéphane Marty (director representing employees), with renewable four-year terms of office.\n\nThe table below shows the expiration dates of the terms of office of the directors, which are renewed on a staggered basis.\n\n| Name                | Office                                                            | Âge at<br>12/31/2023 | Independent<br>Director | First term<br>of office | Expiration of<br>Current term | Seniority<br>on the<br>Board of<br>Directors |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Éric Trappier       | Chairman and<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Director               | 63                   |                         | 2013<br>2012            | 2027<br>2027                  | 11                                           |\n| Charles Edelstenne  | Honorary Chairman<br>Director<br>Member of the Audit<br>Committee | 85                   |                         | 1989                    | 2027                          | 34                                           |\n| Thierry Dassault    | Director                                                          | 66                   |                         | 2021                    | 2027                          | 2                                            |\n| Marie-Hélène Habert | Director                                                          | 58                   |                         | 2014                    | 2026                          | 9                                            |\n| Besma Boumaza       | Director                                                          | 47                   | Yes                     | 2021                    | 2024                          | 2                                            |\n| Henri Proglio       | Director<br>Chairman of the Audit<br>Committee                    | 74                   | Yes                     | 2008                    | 2026                          | 15                                           |\n| Lucia Sinapi-Thomas | Director<br>Member of the Audit<br>Committee                      | 59                   | Yes                     | 2014                    | 2027                          | 9                                            |\n| Stéphane Marty      | Administrateur<br>representing employees                          | 65                   |                         | 2021                    | 2026                          | 3                                            |\n\n### **COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON DECEMBER 31, 2023**\n\nThe aforementioned directors are all of French nationality.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the directors are aged between 47 and 85 with an average age of 65. This includes the director representing employees.\n\nThree women currently sit on the Board of Directors, out of a total of seven members (excluding the director representing employees, in accordance with the law). This equates to a percentage of 43% women, which is above the legal requirement of 40% set by Article L. 225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code, as referred to in Article L. 22-10-3 of the French Commercial Code concerning gender-balanced representation on Boards of Directors.\n\n### **1.2.1. Independence of Directors**\n\nDassault Aviation recognizes the importance of having a number of independent directors on its Board of Directors. The Group considers a director to be independent if he or she has no vested interests and contributes, through his or her skills and freedom of judgment, to the Board's ability to perform its duties. To be classified as independent, directors must not be in a position likely to alter their freedom of judgment or place them in a real or potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe status of independent director is reviewed annually and when a new director is appointed or their term of office is renewed, in view of following formal criteria:\n\n- 1. not have been an employee or have held an executive position within the Company or a company controlled by it in the five preceding years,\n- 2. not being an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a directorship, or in which an employee designated as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company holds a directorship,\n- 3. not being or representing a major shareholder,\n- 4. not being or representing, in a significant way, a commercial (customer, supplier) or financial partner (investment banker, commercial banker), stakeholder or consultant,\n- 5. not be closely related to a major shareholder or executive member,\n- 6. not have been a statutory auditor of the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors may find that a director who does not meet these criteria is nevertheless independent.\n\nThe outcomes of this review are communicated to the shareholders annually in the present Report on Corporate Governance and prior to any vote on the first appointment or reappointment of a director.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below summarizes the outcome of the independence review of each of the directors concerned according to the criteria set out above:\n\n|                                                                                                 | Besma<br>Boumaza | Lucia<br>Sinapi-Thomas | Henri<br>Proglio |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 - not have been an employee or have held an executive position in the five<br>preceding years | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 2 - does not exercise cross mandates                                                            | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 3 - does not represent a major shareholder                                                      | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 4 - no close relationship with a commercial or financial partner                                | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 5 - not be closely related to a major shareholder or executive member                           | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 6 - not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company                                            | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n\nAt its meeting on March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors confirmed, following consideration, that Besma Boumaza, Lucia Sinapi-Thomas and Henri Proglio were independent directors in accordance with the Company's independence criteria. The three independent directors out of a total of seven board members (excluding the director representing employees) represent 43% of the Board of Directors (which is above the legal requirement of one independent director).\n\n### **1.2.2. Information for shareholders in the event of the appointment of a director or renewal of his or her term of office**\n\nWhenever a director is appointed or reappointed, shareholders are provided with detailed information on his or her education and professional experience, which, in addition to his or her personal qualities and values, reflects his or her skill and ability to serve out that term of office.\n\n### **1.2.3. Director representing employees**\n\nThe director representing employees, Stéphane Marty, was reappointed on July 10, 2022, for a fouryear term of office.\n\n### **1.2.4. Directors' share ownership obligation**\n\nIn accordance with Article 15 of the Company's Articles of Association and Article 4 of the Board of Directors' internal regulations, each director, with the exception of the director representing employees in accordance with the law, is required to own a minimum of 250 shares (pro forma after the division of the par value of the shares) in registered form throughout his or her entire term of office. The number of shares held as of December 31, 2023 by each director is specified in paragraph 1.3 \"List of Offices held and duties performed by corporate officers in 2023\".\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.3.

Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors**\n\n#### **1.4.1. Directors' information**\n\nTo ensure the attendance of Directors at Board meetings, the Board of Directors determines the meeting schedule of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee from one year to the next. This schedule is updated and regular reminders are sent to participants by the Secretary to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors meets at least twice a year to approve the company and interim financial statements and as often as required in the interests of the Company.\n\nThe notices of Board meetings specifying the agenda are sent to the directors, the Statutory Auditors and the Government Commissioner at least one week in advance, except in case of emergencies.\n\nPrior to each Board meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that each director receives a complete, relevant, balanced file of information with a sufficient period of time, except in case of emergencies, to enable him or her to prepare for said meeting.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors and the Government Commissioner receive the same documents as the Directors.\n\n### **1.4.2. Activities of the Board of Directors in 2023**\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors met three times, on March 8, May 16 and July 20.\n\nThe average attendance rate at Board meetings was 91.7%.\n\nThe Board of Directors supervised the implementation of the strategies chosen and reviewed the Company's general operations. In particular, the Board of Directors:\n\n- analyzed the amount for order intake, the order book and net sales, and self-financed consolidated research and development,\n- monitored the roll-out of civil and military programs,\n- set the medium-term strategy in the civil and military domains.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors:\n\n- approved the fiscal year 2022 company and consolidated financial statements,\n- convened the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2023,\n- approved the financial statements for the first half-year of 2023,\n- finalized the Parent company's forward-looking management documents in March and July 2023, and reviewed the budgets for self-financed technology investments and industrial investments,\n- carried out the annual review of related-party agreements approved in previous fiscal years,\n- was informed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the amount of sureties, endorsements and guarantees granted for commitments by controlled subsidiaries,\n- authorized the signing of the agreement for the acquisition by Dassault Aviation from GIMD of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes for EUR 25.24 million,\n- approved the wording of the half-yearly and annual financial press releases,\n- evaluated the performance criteria relating to performance shares granted in 2022 and noted the acquisition of said shares by their beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period,\n- conducted another performance share plan by preparing the list of beneficiaries and defining the conditions under which their shares become fully vested (achievement of performance criteria, vesting and holding periods, employment on the day the shares become fully vested), with delegation to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of all powers to implement the allocation of performance shares,\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n- conducted an assessment of the performance criterion for additional pension rights, for the 2022 fiscal year, for executive corporate officers that was consistent with legal requirements,\n- set the performance criterion for additional pension rights for the 2023 fiscal year,\n- approved the compensation allocated and paid in fiscal year 2022 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the directors,\n- set the principles of compensation for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Directors for fiscal year 2023,\n- put the new share buyback program into effect and sub-delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to perform any transaction under that program, subject to the conditions set by the General Meeting,\n- allocated the shares acquired under share buyback programs,\n- decided, as authorized by the General Meeting, to reduce the Company's share capital in March, May and July 2023 through the cancellation of shares purchased under the share buyback programs and delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to implement the above capital reductions.\n- renewed the terms of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer Éric Trappier and of the Chief Operating Officer Loïk Segalen, and approved the renewal of their compensation and additional benefits in accordance with the Compensation Policy 2023.\n\n### **1.4.3. Audit Committee**\n\nPursuant to the order (\"Ordonnance\") of December 8, 2008, which transposed Directive 2006/43/EC of May 17, 2006 on statutory audits of company and consolidated financial statements, on July 22, 2009 the Board of Directors established an Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2023, the Audit Committee met twice: on March 3 for the 2022 financial statements and on July 19 for the financial statements for the first half of 2023. The attendance rate of Committee members at meetings in 2023 was 100%.\n\nThe Audit Committee consists of Henri Proglio, Chairman, Charles Edelstenne and Lucia Sinapi-Thomas. They were appointed because of the expertise they received from their academic training, their experience in finance and accounting for listed companies, and their time as members of executive management. All three are non-executive directors.\n\nThis composition meets the requirements of the aforementioned order (\"Ordonnance\"). The Board of Directors considered that Lucia Sinapi-Thomas and Henri Proglio met the independence criteria set forth in paragraph 1.2.1. above.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring:\n\n- the procedure for preparing the financial information,\n- the effectiveness of the risk management and internal auditing systems,\n- the auditing of the company and consolidated financial statements by the Statutory Auditors,\n- the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets at least twice a year. Participants, including the Statutory Auditors, are notified of this via a schedule set from one year to the next. The schedule is sent to all participants and meeting reminders are sent by the Secretary of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Audit Committee:\n\n- examined the company and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year, the financial statements for the first half of 2023, the Parent Company's forward-looking management documents and the main events of the relevant year or half-year,\n- reviewed the risk factors, the internal auditing and the risk management of the Directors' report,\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n- met with the Statutory Auditors, with no Company representatives being present, after examining the conclusions of their work and their declaration of independence,\n- reviewed the annual feedback on the assessment carried out by the Financial Department and the Legal Affairs and Insurance Department on related-party agreements,\n- reviewed the Risk Committee's summary, the 2023 audit plan, the update on 2022 actions and the follow-up on actions from the 2020 and 2021 audits,\n- reported back on its work to the Board of Directors.\n\n### **1.4.4. Board of Directors' internal regulations**\n\nIn addition to the Articles of Association, which set out the Company's rules of operation, the Board meeting of July 25, 2012 approved the Board of Directors' internal regulations, which allow in particular directors to take part in meetings (debating and voting) by means of telecommunications that are compliant with applicable regulations. On March 4, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new version of the Board of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe Board of Directors' internal regulations will be updated in 2024 to reflect Order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 which transposed Directive EU 2022/2464 of December 14, 2022 as regards corporate sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Board of Directors' internal regulations are available for viewing online on the Company's website at [www.dassault-aviation.com.](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/)\n\n### **1.4.5. Prevention and management of conflicts of interest**\n\nWith respect to the prevention and management of conflicts of interest, directors are required to inform the Board of Directors of any situation of potential or actual conflict of interest between them and the corporate interests of Dassault Aviation and must, where applicable, refrain from attending the discussions and abstain from voting on the corresponding deliberation at the meeting.\n\nIn particular, at any time, the participation of any director in a transaction in which Dassault Aviation has a direct interest or of which he or she became aware as a director shall be brought to the attention of the Board of Directors prior to its conclusion.\n\nIn addition, GIMD, as the majority shareholder of Dassault Aviation, takes care to prevent potential conflicts of interest with respect to the Directors appointed on its proposal.\n\nas of the date of this report and to the best of the Company's knowledge, there is no potential conflict of interest between the duties of the directors with respect to Dassault Aviation and their private interests.\n\nThese measures are supplemented by the Internal Charter on related-party agreements described in paragraph 1.5.2. of this report.\n\n### **1.4.6. Prevention and management of insider dealing**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions resulting from the European Regulation of April 16, 2014, on market abuse and the AMF Guide for ongoing information and the management of inside information, published on October 26, 2016, and updated on April 29, 2021, the Company established procedures for \"blackout periods\" (periods when transactions involving the shares issued by the Company are prohibited), which begin at least 30 days before the publication of the company annual and half-yearly financial statements. When the Company publishes financial press releases after the close of the stock market, the date of publication is included in the blackout period.\n\nEvery year, the directors are informed by letter of the calendar of \"black-out periods\" for the coming year.\n\nThe financial calendar is published online on the Company's website at the start of each financial period.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the list of permanent and occasional insiders is reviewed quarterly and at any other time as needed.\n\n### **1.5. Related-party agreements**\n\n### **1.5.1. Agreements between a shareholder or a corporate officer of the Company and one of its subsidiaries**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 225-37-4-2° of the French Commercial Code, must be mentioned in the Report on Corporate Governance, agreements entered into, directly or indirectly or by proxy between:\n\n- one of the corporate officers or shareholders of Dassault Aviation holding a fraction greater than 10% of the voting rights and\n\n- a controlled company by Dassault Aviation under Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, with the exception of agreements representing a current transaction entered into under normal terms and conditions.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there is no agreement between:\n\n- a corporate officer of Dassault Aviation or GIMD, which holds more than 10% of the voting rights in Dassault Aviation and\n- Dassault Falcon Jet (or one of its subsidiaries), Dassault Falcon Service, Sogitec Industries or any other controlled company by Dassault Aviation under Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code,\n\nthat would not constitute a current transaction concluded under normal terms and conditions.\n\n### **1.5.2. Internal Charter on regulated related-party agreements and agreements representing a current transaction entered into under normal terms and conditions**\n\nIn accordance with Law No. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 on the growth and transformation of companies, so-called \"Pacte\", the Board of Directors of the Company established a procedure for regularly assessing whether agreements deemed to be current fulfill the following two conditions: relate to current transactions and be entered into under normal conditions.\n\nThis procedure, as expressed in an Internal Charter, was approved by the Dassault Aviation Board of Directors on February 26, 2020 and has been applicable since that date. It is based on the joint evaluation by the Financial Department and the Legal Affairs and Insurance Department of the Company, followed by the Audit Committee.\n\n### **1.6. Methods of the exercise of Executive Management**\n\nIn accordance with the laws in force, the possibility of separating the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive Officer was introduced into the Company's Articles of Association during the General Meeting of April 25, 2002.\n\nOn April 25, 2002, the Board of Directors decided that the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be responsible for the Executive Management of the Company.\n\nThis was because the Board of Directors had chosen the Executive Management option that it deemed best suited to the Company's specific features. The decision was therefore made not to separate the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSince January 9, 2013, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been assisted by a Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThis mode of Executive Management was maintained by the Board of Directors on May 16, 2023, when it also renewed the terms of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer for four years with the same powers.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.7. Powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n\nThe powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not limited by the Company's Articles of Association nor by the Board of Directors, in the decisions appointing him and subsequently renewing his term of office.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes and directs the work of the Board, reporting back on this to the General Meeting. The Chairman executes the decisions of the Board. He sees to it that the Company management bodies run smoothly and ensures that the directors are able to fulfill their duties.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer therefore exercises his powers with no limitations other than those set forth by the applicable regulations concerning the powers attributed expressly by law to General Meetings of shareholders and to the Board of Directors.\n\n### **1.8. Powers of the Chief Operating Officer**\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer assists the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. With respect to third parties, he has the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n### **1.9. Executive Committee**\n\nPresided over by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Committee includes the persons in charge of the Company's various departments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, it consisted of:\n\n- Éric Trappier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\n- Loïk Segalen, Chief Operating Officer,\n- Jean-Marie Albertini, Senior Vice-President, Sales,\n- Laurent Bendavid, Senior Executive Vice-President, IT and Chief Digital Officer,\n- Carlos Brana, Senior Executive Vice-President, Civil Aircraft,\n- Bruno Chevalier, Senior Executive Vice-President, Military Customer Support,\n- Bruno Coiffier, Senior Executive Vice-President, Procurement and Purchasing,\n- Denis Dassé, Chief Financial Officer,\n- Jean-Marc Gasparini, Executive Vice-President, Military and Space Programs,\n- Florent Gateau, Senior Executive Vice-President, Total Quality,\n- Bruno Giorgianni, Executive Committee Secretary and Senior Vice-President, Public Affairs and Security,\n- Valérie Guillemet, Senior Vice-President, Human Resources,\n- Richard Lavaud, Senior Executive Vice-President, International,\n- Nicolas Mojaïsky\\*, Senior Executive Vice-President, Engineering,\n- Frédéric Petit, Senior Vice-President, Falcon Programs,\n- Ary Plagnol, Senior Executive Vice-President, Industrial Operations.\n\n\\* Following the retirement of Nicolas Mojaïsky, Pascale Lohat took over as Senior Executive Vice-President, Engineering, from January 1, 2024.\n\nThe Executive Committee covers all subjects related to running and operating the different aspects of the Company. It meets once per week.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.10. Gender parity on the management bodies (information referred to in Article L. 22-10-10 2° of the French Commercial Code)**\n\nOur Company is mainly masculine due to the highly industrial and technical nature of its activity. Women represent between 18% and 28% of the engineering schools' population, depending on specialization.\n\nBeing conscious of the importance of gender parity, the Company has adopted a proactive policy for hiring women, which has been strengthened since 2010 with quantified recruitment targets. Over a 10 year period, this has increased the percentage of women, from 16.5% to 19.4% in 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, women account for 15% of the most senior positions (position IIIB and above) and 7% of management positions. The Company has set quantitative and qualitative objectives to improve this situation:\n\n- continue with educational cooperation schemes to promote careers in aeronautics and encourage young women to enter this field,\n- hire women for executive employees positions, to take advantage of their skills and increase the percentage of women,\n- improve the presence of women in the chain of command, in management positions and in positions of responsibility,\n- ensure each year that the gender parity is respected in the distribution of individual increases and promotions,\n- converge toward an equivalent average length of time between two promotions between male and female executive employees.\n\nIn addition, promotions to the highest levels of responsibility are subject to an annual review by the Executive Management to ensure that women are properly represented.\n\n### **1.11. General Meeting of shareholders**\n\n### **1.11.1. Admission**\n\nThe conditions governing shareholders' attendance at General Meetings are set forth in Articles 29 and 31 of the Articles of Association.

Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024**\n\nThe purpose of this paragraph is to set forth the components of the compensation policy for directors and executive corporate officers for 2024. This compensation policy is subject to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (Resolutions 7, 8 and 9 as described in the paragraph \"Presentation of resolutions submitted to shareholder vote\" below).\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 paragraph II of the French Commercial Code, we confirm that the payment of variable and exceptional compensation elements is contingent on approval by the Ordinary General Meeting of the compensation elements of the persons concerned.\n\n### **2.2.1. Compensation policy for Directors**\n\nCompensation is allocated annually according to the following principles:\n\n- for the Board of Directors:\n\t- o fixed compensation of EUR 28,000,\n\t- o variable compensation of EUR 10,000 multiplied by the attendance rate at meetings,\n\nthese amounts are doubled for the Chairman of the Board of Directors,\n\n- for the Audit Committee: variable compensation only dependent on attendance at meetings of EUR 3,000 per meeting (double for the Chairman).\n\nThe overall amount authorized by the General Meeting of May 15, 2014 (EUR 444,000) was not modified.\n\nIn addition, each Director is covered by a Directors' and Officers' liability insurance policy (known in French as RCMS). This policy covers all managers and corporate officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n### **2.2.2. Compensation policy for corporate officers**\n\nThe principles of the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer have been established by the Board of Directors.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer consists of fixed compensation and variable compensation.\n\nThe target variable compensation implemented in 2024:\n\n- EUR 1,800,000 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer compensated by the reduction of 10,000 allocated performance shares,\n- EUR 1,602,000 for the Chief Operating Officer compensated by a reduction of 8,900 allocated performance shares.\n\nThis compensation is subject to the same conditions and performance criteria as the performance shares presented below.\n\nThe fixed compensation and the variable compensation change according to the increase policy for executive employees of the Company resulting from the Annual Mandatory Negotiations, unless decided otherwise by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, under their respective mandates, will not receive:\n\n- any exceptional compensation,\n- any stock options,\n- any private unemployment insurance,\n- any severance packages,\n- any special supplementary pensions.\n\nIn 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer will receive performance shares.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to award them 13,000 and 8,000 shares, respectively. These shares will become vested provided the following performance criteria are met:\n\n- adjusted Group operating margin,\n- two aspects of corporate social responsibility, namely:\n\t- o feminization,\n\t- o the low-carbon plan,\n- qualitative assessment of individual performance.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors has determined the following additional conditions:\n\n- a vesting period of one year, expiring on March 4, 2025 inclusive,\n- presence in the workforce at the end of the vesting period,\n- a one-year holding period, beginning on March 5, 2025 and ending on March 4, 2026 inclusive,\n- starting on March 5, 2026, retention by the corporate officers of 20% of those shares for the duration of their term of office.\n\nIn addition, the 2024 Share plan prohibits executive corporate officers who have been granted performance shares from using risk hedging until after the end of the holding period.\n\nThe employment contracts of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer have been suspended. Upon effective reinstatement of the contracts, they will recover the rights of salaried senior executives in their category, according to the Company's rules, which will be revalued at the date of termination of their term of office by the average percentage increase in executive salaries during the period of suspension of the employment contract.\n\nIn particular, upon effective reinstatement of their contracts, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer shall be subject to the conditions of severance pay applicable to employees of their category in accordance with Company rules, it being specified that, depending on the formula chosen, the seniority taken into account may cover the years during which their employment contract was suspended, like the other employees.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor supplementary pensions, they are eligible for:\n\n- the rights acquired under the plan applicable to executive employees of the Company, which have been frozen as of December 31, 2017,\n- the rights acquired in 2018 and 2019 under the pension plan established on January 1, 2018, which is applicable to members of the Executive Committee and to the Company's flight crew currently grounded in accordance with order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 regarding supplementary defined-benefit pensions,\n- the rights acquired under the plan applicable as of January 1, 2020 to members of the Executive Committee and the Company's flight crew, which provides for the annual vesting of additional pension rights equal to 2% of gross annual compensation, subject to performance conditions defined each year by the Board of Directors, which shall duly note the achievement thereof.\n\nIn addition, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, like the Directors, are each covered by a Directors' and Corporate Officers' Liability Insurance policy (known in French as RCMS). This policy covers all managers and corporate officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nFinally, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer shall each receive, during the performance of their terms of office, a chauffeur-driven company car, reimbursement of the actual expenses incurred in their duties, and health and welfare plans applicable to all of the Company's executive employees.\n\n### **2.2.3. Presentation of resolutions submitted to shareholder vote**\n\nThe \"Sapin 2\" Law introduced a new shareholder consultation regime for the compensation of corporate officers, as amended by order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019, and supplemented by Decree No. 2019-1235 of the same day.\n\nShareholders are called upon to express an opinion in two stages:\n\n- vote after the fact (referred to as an \"ex-post vote\"): the compensation elements paid or attributed to directors and corporate officers during the past fiscal year, as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance, shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders.\n- -\n- advance vote on compensation policy (referred to as an \"ex-ante\" vote): the compensation policy for directors and corporate officers, as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance, shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders,\n\nConsequently, the following resolutions will be submitted for your approval:\n\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the directors as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 4),\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 5),\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the Chief Operating Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 6),\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the directors as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 7),\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 8),\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the Chief Operating Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 9).\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.

These consolidated financial statements will be submitted for approval to the annual general meeting on May 16, 2024.\n\n### **1.1. Basis of preparation for the 2023 consolidated financial statements**\n\nDassault Aviation Group consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations as adopted by the European Union and applicable at the closing date.\n\nSince January 1, 2023, the Group has applied the following standards, amendments and interpretations:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" on significant accounting policies disclosures,\n- amendments to IAS 8 \"Definition of Accounting Estimates,\"\n- amendments to IAS 12 on deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction,\n- amendments to IAS 12 relating to income taxes following the approval of Pillar II model rules.\n\nThese texts have no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **1.2. New standards mandatory after December 31, 2023**\n\nThe following texts have still not been applied in advance by the Group when that option was offered.\n\nThe main texts adopted by the European Union whose application is mandatory after January 1, 2024 are as follows:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\", on the classification of liabilities as current or non-current and non-current liabilities with covenants,\n- amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 relating to supplier finance arrangements,\n- amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\" relating to lease liabilities in a sale and leaseback,\n\nThe potential impacts of these texts on the Group's financial statements are currently being assessed.\n\n### **1.3. Impact of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia**\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which Russia started on February 24, 2022, triggered a major crisis in the aviation sector, leading to shortages and putting significant pressure on supplies. The risk is that it could have a lasting impact on the Group and its partners, sub-contractors and customers. The regulations adopted by the European Union and the United States are strictly enforced by the Group, especially the ban on commercial transactions and the restriction on financial transactions with sanctioned persons or entities. Some entities in the maintenance network in Europe have been significantly affected by the loss of Russian customers. Operations in Russia, the Moscow office and the Dassault Falcon Service maintenance subsidiary, have stopped doing business.\n\nAs of December 31, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict had no material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.4. Accounting choices and management estimates**\n\nTo prepare the Group's financial statements, Management is required to make estimates and issue assumptions that could have an impact on the amounts entered in the balance sheet and in the income statement.\n\nThese estimates concern, in particular:\n\n- the results of contracts in progress,\n- the calculation of provisions for contingencies and charges and provisions for impairment,\n- the calculation of development costs that meet capitalization criteria,\n- the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nThese estimates are calculated by taking into account past experience, elements known at the closing date and any reasonable change assumptions.\n\nThe estimates used by the Group to prepare the financial statements take into account, as far as the available information allows, the risks induced by climate change whether physical, regulatory or related to customer expectations and sector commitments. Their impact on cash flow has been integrated into the business plans of the cash-generating units concerned.\n\nSubsequent results may therefore differ from such estimates.\n\n### **1.5. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nConsolidated balance sheet items are presented as current/non-current. The Group's activities have long operating cycles. As a result, the assets/liabilities generally realized in the context of the operating cycle (inventories and work-in-progress, contract assets and liabilities, receivables, payables, etc.) are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets and liabilities, without distinction between the amount due within one year and the amount due at more than one year.\n\nConsolidated income statement items are presented by nature.\n\nNet operating income represents all income and expenses not arising from financial activities, equity associates, discontinued operations or operations being sold, and income taxes. It is composed of two separate parts: current operating income and other non-current income and expenses. Only significant unusual items are recorded in other non-current income and expenses. No items met this criteria in 2023 or in 2022.\n\n### **1.6. Segment reporting**\n\nIFRS 8, \"Operating Segments,\" requires the presentation of information according to internal management criteria. The activity of the Dassault Aviation Group relates entirely to the aerospace domain. Internal reporting to the chairman and chief executive officer and to the chief operating officer, used for strategy and decision-making, does not include a performance analysis, under IFRS 8 terms, at a lower level than this sector.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.7. Consolidation principles and methods**\n\n### **1.7.1. Scope and methods of consolidation**\n\n### **Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe financial statements of material subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by Dassault Aviation are fully consolidated. Material subsidiaries jointly controlled by Dassault Aviation (joint ventures) or in which the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nConsolidated companies are listed in note 2.\n\n#### **Consolidation thresholds**\n\nFor the application of the factor of relative significance, a company controlled by the Group or in which it has significant influence is included in the scope of consolidation if all of the following criteria are met: total assets and liabilities exceed 2% of the Group total,\n\n- total net sales exceed 2% of the Group total,\n- equity exceeds 3% of the Group total.\n\nEntities can be consolidated by a management decision even though they do not meet the criteria previously defined. As of December 31, 2023, all non-consolidated companies do not collectively exceed the thresholds described above.\n\n#### **Inter-company transactions**\n\nAll material inter-company transactions and internal margins included in non-current assets, inventories and work-in-progress are eliminated.\n\n#### **Closing date**\n\nThe majority of companies close their fiscal year on December 31.\n\n#### **1.7.2. Conversion of financial statements of non-euro area subsidiaries**\n\nThe currency used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is the euro.\n\nThe financial statements of non-euro area subsidiaries are translated as follows:\n\n- assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate,\n- the income statement is translated at the average annual rate.\n\nCurrency translation adjustments are recognized in equity and do not impact the income statement.\n\n### **1.8. Valuation principles**\n\n### **1.8.1. Goodwill and business combinations**\n\nBusiness combinations are recognized under the acquisition method as described in IFRS 3. Under this method, the Group recognizes the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill, which reflects the difference between the acquisition cost of investments and the share of the revalued net assets, is recognized:\n\nimmediately as a loss when it is negative,\n\n- on the asset side of the balance sheet when it is positive:\n- under goodwill if the acquired company is fully consolidated,\n- under equity associates if the acquired company is consolidated under the equity method.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price is finalized within a maximum period of one year from the date of acquisition.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to annually impairment tests (see note 1.8.3. Impairment and recoverable value).\n\nAcquisition-related costs (valuation fees, consulting fees, etc.) are recognized under operating income as incurred.\n\n### **1.8.2. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\n### **Accounting principles**\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition or production cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization and impairment. Each identified component of an intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment is recognized and depreciated and amortized separately.\n\nThe rights of use relating to leases as defined by IFRS 16 are recorded on the balance sheet at the lease contract conclusion for the discounted value of future lease payments. Contracts within the scope of IFRS 16 are mainly related to real estate leases (land and buildings). The terms selected generally correspond to the firm duration of the contract unless an intention to renew or terminate the contract is known. The Group applies the two exemptions provided for by the standard (leases of less than 12 months and leases for low-value assets).\n\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. No residual value is taken into account, except for aircraft.\n\nDepreciation and amortization periods depend on their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each year-end for material assets.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 38 \"Intangible Assets\" concerning development costs, the Group determines the development phase of its programs that meets the criteria for capitalization. Development costs are capitalized if they satisfy the following three determining criteria:\n\n- the technical criterion is met when the period for validation of results after the maiden flight has elapsed without questioning the project,\n- the economic criterion is validated by the orders placed or options obtained on the date the technical criterion is considered satisfied,\n- the financial information reliability criterion is satisfied for significant programs because the information system differentiates between research and development phases. If such a distinction cannot be made, as may be the case for minor developments (e.g. modification, improvement, etc.), those development costs are not capitalized.\n\nThe asset must generate clearly identifiable future economic benefits attributable to a specific product.\n\nCapitalized development costs are valued at the production cost. They are amortized on the basis of the number of aircraft delivered during the year, divided by an estimated number of aircraft to be delivered under the program.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Useful lives**\n\nInitial useful lives are determined as follows:\n\n| Software                            | 3-4 years                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Development costs                   | depend on the number of units to be produced |\n| Industrial buildings                | 20-25 years                                  |\n| Office buildings                    | 20-25 years                                  |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 7-15 years                                   |\n| Plant, equipment and machinery      | 3-10 years                                   |\n| Aircraft                            | 4-15 years                                   |\n| Rolling stock                       | 4 years                                      |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3-10 years                                   |\n| Used property                       | on a case-by-case basis                      |\n| Rights of use                       | based on the duration of each lease contract |\n\nThe initial useful life of an asset is extended or reduced if the conditions in which the asset is used justify it.\n\n### **1.8.3. Impairment and recoverable value of intangible assets, plant, property and equipment and goodwill**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 \"Impairment of Assets,\" all non-current assets (tangible and intangible) and goodwill are subject to an impairment test when an indication of impairment is detected, and at least once a year on December 31 for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.\n\nIndications of impairment derive from significant adverse changes of a lasting nature, affecting the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used by the Group.\n\nImpairment tests consist in ensuring that the recoverable values of the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is assigned are at least equal to their net book value. Otherwise, impairment is recognized in net income and the net book value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable value.\n\nThe recoverable value of property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is the higher value between its fair value, less the costs of disposal, and its value in use.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit corresponds to its value in use. Each consolidated company represents a cash-generating unit, i.e. the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and outflows.\n\nThe value in use is calculated using the discounted future cash flow method. Discount rates are reviewed each year. As of December 31, 2023, the Group's after-tax discount rate was 9.8% (9.9% as of December 31, 2022). Value in use is determined on the basis of projected after-tax cash flows resulting from economic assumptions and estimated operating conditions used by Management and takes into account a terminal value.\n\nWhen a cash-generating unit needs to be impaired, the impairment is first of all applied to the goodwill then, if appropriate, to the other assets of the cash-generating unit proportionate to their net book value. Impairments may be reversed, except for those relating to goodwill.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.4. Equity associates**\n\nInvestments in equity associates undergo an impairment test once there are objective indications of any long-term loss in value.\n\nAn impairment is recognized if the recoverable value is lower than the carrying value, with the recoverable value being equivalent to the value in use, as defined in paragraph 1.8.3., or the fair value net of transaction costs, whichever is higher.\n\nConcerning the equity investment in Thales, when an impairment test is carried out, the operational and financial assumptions used come directly from data provided by Thales management.\n\nAn impairment may be reversed if the recoverable value once again exceeds the carrying value.\n\n### **1.8.5. Other non-current financial assets**\n\n#### **Non-listed securities and Embraer shares**\n\nThese securities are recognized at their fair value.\n\nIn the absence of any external valuation elements, the fair value of unconsolidated investments, non-listed, represents the share in net assets (calculated based on the most recent financial statements available at the time of accounting) plus any significant unrealized gains or it is based on the discounted future cash flow method (see note 1.8.3). These items are classified as level 3 (according to IFRS 13).\n\nThe fair value of Embraer shares corresponded to the market price as of the balance sheet date. These items were classified as level 1 (according to IFRS 13). The Embraer shares were sold in 2023.\n\nChanges in fair value and gains or losses on disposal for these securities are recognized under other income and expenses directly recorded through equity, without any impact on income or loss. Only dividends continue to be recorded in income.\n\n#### **Other non-current financial assets**\n\nOther financial assets mainly comprise advance lease payments, loans granted to investments and loans granted to employees for a housing loan. Loans are recorded at amortized cost (historical cost less repayments). Other assets are recorded at their historical cost.\n\nOther non-current financial assets also include Dassault Aviation's investments in investment funds, including the aeronautical investment fund, valued at fair value through income or loss.\n\n### **1.8.6. Inventories and work-in-progress**\n\nIncoming raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods inventories are measured at acquisition cost for items purchased and production cost for items produced. Outgoing inventories are valued at the weighted average cost, except for used aircraft which are stated at acquisition cost. Work-in-progress is stated at production cost and does not include abnormal production costs.\n\nInventories and work-in-progress are impaired when their net realizable value is less than their carrying amount.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs for completion and making the sale. It takes into account the technical or commercial obsolescence of articles and the risks associated with their low turnover.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.7. Contract assets and liabilities**\n\nFor a given contract, the amount of cumulative revenue accounted for in respect of all performance obligations, less payments received and trade receivables which, in the balance sheet, are booked separately, is recognized under contract assets or contract liabilities.\n\n### **1.8.8. Receivables**\n\nA receivable is an unconditional right to payment by the customer. Trade receivables include receivables arising from finance leases. These represent the discounted amount of the expected lease revenues, plus the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the finance lease.\n\nA provision for impairment is recorded when the recoverable value of a receivable is lower than the book value.\n\nThe recoverable value of a receivable is estimated based on expected losses and takes into account the type of customer and the history of payments.\n\nThe receivable is impaired up to the amount of the estimated risk for the portion not covered by credit insurance (Bpifrance Assurance Export or collateral).\n\nNon-impaired receivables are recent receivables and/or receivables with no material credit risk.\n\nForeign currency receivables, translated by each subsidiary into their local currency at the day's rate, are revalued at each closing on the basis of the closing rate. Revaluation differences are recognized in operating income.\n\n### **1.8.9. Other current financial assets**\n\nOther current financial assets mainly consist of time deposits at more than 3 months, debt securities and cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nThe time deposits and debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, as the Group does not intend to convert these investments into cash in the short term for operational purposes. Other investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe associated financial results are presented as income from other financial assets within net financial income.\n\n### **1.8.10. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents satisfy the criteria set forth in IAS 7, \"Statement of Cash Flows\": short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are not subject to a material risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with a maturity of less than three months and cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nThe time deposits are recorded at amortized cost and the cash investments in the form of marketable securities are measured at fair value in the income statement.\n\nThe associated financial results are presented as income from cash and cash equivalents within net financial income.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.11. Treasury shares**\n\n### **Treasury shares**\n\nTreasury shares are deducted from equity at their acquisition cost. Any gains or losses from the sale of treasury shares are recognized directly in equity and do not contribute to the income for the fiscal year.\n\n### **Share-based payments**\n\nDassault Aviation has settled plans to grant performance shares. These allotments are recognized as an expense representing the fair value of the services rendered by the beneficiaries.\n\nThe fair value of the services is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares on the grant date, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period.\n\nThe performance conditions are taken into account when estimating the number of shares to be granted at the end of the vesting period.\n\nThe benefits granted constitute personnel expenses and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This expense is recognized against consolidated reserves.\n\n### **1.8.12. Provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n### **Provisions for warranties and other contract risks**\n\nDassault Aviation has formal obligations under sales or procurement contracts relating to the equipment, products and/or services delivered (software development, systems integration, etc.).\n\nThese obligations can be distinguished between:\n\n- \"current\" warranty: repair of defective equipment during the contractual warranty period or by implicit obligations, handling hardware or software malfunctions identified following qualification and handover to users, etc.,\n- \"regulatory\" warranty: treatment by the manufacturer of any changes to the regulatory framework determined by the regulatory authorities or any regulatory non-compliance identified by the manufacturer or a user after delivery of materials or products,\n- other risks in connection with the performance of the contract.\n\nThe amount of the provisions is mainly determined as follows:\n\n- on the basis of feedback on the costs incurred,\n- on the basis of quotes provided by specialists in the relevant fields.\n\n### **Retirement costs**\n\nCommitments to employees for retirement costs are measured using the projected unit credit method. The commitments are estimated for all employees on the basis of vested rights (based on the employee's length of service at the end of the period relative to total career expectancy) and a projection of current salaries, after taking into account the mortality risk, employee turnover, and a discounting assumption. The rates used have been determined based on the yield for top-ranking corporate longterm bonds, with maturity equivalent to the duration of the calculated liabilities.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group applies the revised IAS 19 which stipulates:\n\n- the recognition of all actuarial adjustments in income and expense recognized directly through equity,\n- immediate recognition of the cost of past services,\n- alignment of the expected return from the plan's assets to the discount rates,\n- the recognition of the sole administrative costs relating to management of the assets as a deduction from their actual return.\n\nThe provision or asset that appears in the balance sheet corresponds to the total commitment net of plan assets. The impact on the income statement is fully recognized in operating income.\n\n### **1.8.13. Borrowings and payables**\n\nForeign currency borrowings and payables, translated by each subsidiary into their local currency at the day's rate, are revalued at each closing based on the closing rate. Revaluation differences are recognized in operating income.\n\nLoans taken out by the Group are initially recorded at the amount received net of transaction costs, and subsequently at the amortized cost, calculated using the effective interest rate.\n\nLease liabilities relating to leases as defined by IFRS 16 are recognized on the balance sheet at the origin of the lease for the discounted value of future payments.\n\n### **1.8.14. Discounting of receivables, payables and provisions**\n\nReceivables and payables are recognized for their discounted amounts when the payment date is more than one year and the effects of the discounting are significant.\n\nThe provision relating to retirement severance payments and related benefits is discounted in accordance with IAS 19 \"Employee Benefits\" and the lease liabilities are discounted in accordance with IFRS 16 \"Leases.\"\n\nOther provisions are stated at their current value.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n### **1.8.15. Derivative financial instruments**\n\n### **Derivative financial instruments subscribed by the Group**\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nExchange rate risks mainly arise from US dollar-denominated sales. The corresponding future cash flows are partially hedged using forward exchange contracts and currency options.\n\n### **Evaluation and recognition of derivatives**\n\nUpon initial recognition, derivatives are booked at acquisition cost in the balance sheet under \"Derivative Financial Instruments.\"\n\nThey are subsequently stated at fair value, calculated on the basis of the market price communicated by the relevant financial institutions and the market parameters observed on the closing date, taking into account any counterparty risks. The valuation of financial instruments is level 2 (according to IFRS 13).\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting when the criteria defined by IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" are met. Foreign exchange derivatives are documented, on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of spot or forward prices.\n\nDerivatives eligible for hedge accounting are recognized as follows:\n\n- changes in fair value of hedging instruments are posted, net of tax, to other income and expense recognized through equity, with the exception of the ineffective amount of the hedge, if any, which is recognized in income,\n- when the cash flow is received, the gain or loss on the foreign exchange hedging instrument is recognized in income.\n\nIf a derivative, chosen for the effectiveness of the economic hedging it provides to the Group, does not meet the conditions required by the hedge accounting standard (foreign exchange options), then changes in its fair value are recognized in financial income.\n\n### **1.8.16. Net sales and income**\n\n### **Recognition of net sales and operating income**\n\nThe results on completion are based on estimates of net sales and costs at completion (taking into account the program departments' forecasts) which are revised as the contract progresses and take into account the latest known events at the closing date. The potential losses on completion are recognized as soon as they are known.\n\n### Sale of goods\n\nNet sales and net income are recognized over time if the transfer of control of goods is gradual and at a point in time otherwise.\n\nFor the majority of its contracts, the IFRS 15 criteria for the recognition of revenue over time are not met, in particular for Rafale and Falcon sales whose alternative use could be demonstrated. Revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are delivered in the majority of cases.\n\nFinance leases are recognized as credit sales in application of IFRS 16, \"Leases.\"\n\n#### Sale of services\n\nRevenue from performance of services is recognized over time, if the criteria of IFRS 15 are met, as it is the case for maintenance contracts. The percentage-of-completion method used by the Group will be the cost-to-cost method: whereby revenue is recognized based on costs incurred at a given date divided by total costs expected at completion.\n\nServices for which the criteria of IFRS 15 are not met, as is the case for certain development contracts, are recognized at the end of the service provided.\n\n#### Agent / principal\n\nContracts involving co-contractors and for which Dassault Aviation is the sole signatory are analyzed to determine the Company's status as a principal or agent. If the analysis classifies the Company as an agent, only the proportionate share of net sales due to the agent is recognized. Otherwise, the entirety of net sales and related expenses (including the share attributable to co-contractors) is recognized.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Backlog\n\nThe backlog presented in note 24 corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations on the closing date.\n\n### **Government grants**\n\nResearch tax credits are included in operating income in \"other revenue\" when obtaining them does not depend on the realization of a tax profit.\n\n### **Net financial income/expense**\n\nNet financial income/expense primarily represents:\n\n- financial income related to cash and cash equivalents and other current and non-current financial assets,\n- financial expenses related to loans taken out by the Group and locked-in employee profit-sharing funds,\n- the financing component when there is, for a given contract, a significant difference between the moment when the cash is received and the moment when the revenue is recognized,\n- interest expenses related to lease liabilities under IFRS 16,\n- dividends from non-consolidated companies,\n- financial income from finance lease contracts,\n- losses and gains on derivative instruments that do not meet the conditions required by the standard for hedge accounting.\n\n### **1.8.17. Deferred tax**\n\nDeferred taxes linked to temporary differences are calculated per company.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 \"Income Taxes,\" deferred tax assets are only recognized, for each company, insofar as the estimated future income is sufficient to cover these assets and their maturity does not exceed ten years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is paid, based on local tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted by year-end.\n\nTaxes on items recognized directly through equity are charged or credited to equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset per entity for presentation on the balance sheet.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 2 - Scope of consolidation**\n\n### **2.1. Scope as of December 31, 2023**\n\nDassault Aviation is a French group that designs and manufactures military aircraft, business jets and space systems.

Provisions for retirement severance payments**\n\n### **12.3.1. Description of the plans**\n\nThe plans set up are either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.\n\n### **Defined-contribution plans**\n\nIn certain countries, the Group pays contributions bases on salaries to state organizations overseeing basic pension schemes (e.g., *Securité Sociale* or the compulsory supplementary schemes ARRCO and AGIRC in France). These plans do not impose any obligations on the Group other than the payment of contributions: there is no related benefit obligation and contributions are expensed in the period they are incurred.\n\nAmounts paid represent EUR -127,896 thousand in 2023 and EUR -112,942 thousand in 2022.\n\n#### **Defined-benefit plans**\n\nDefined-benefit plans relate to different types of benefits:\n\n- pensions and end-of-career indemnities (legal or contractual), and other long-term benefits (jubilee awards, etc.), particularly in France;\n- supplementary pension schemes, mainly in the United States providing the payment of an annuity. This plan was frozen as at December 31, 2021 and was replaced by a defined-contribution plan.\n\nThese commitments are partially covered by plan assets. A provision is recognized if the value of the assets is insufficient to cover the obligations.\n\n### **12.3.2.

Cash and liquidity risks**\n\n### **23.1.1. Financial debts**\n\nThe Group has no significant risk in relation to its financial debt. A description of the financial debts appears in note 11.\n\n### **23.1.2. Cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets**\n\nThe Group has a solid financial structure and works only with top-tier banks.\n\nThe Group investment portfolio is primarily composed of time deposits and money market investments with no significant risk of impairment.\n\n| (in EUR thousands)                                                   | Market value | %    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand, money market investments and time deposits | 5,990,274    | 81%  |\n| Investments in bonds and other debt securities                       | 770,691      | 11%  |\n| Unspecified investments                                              | 610,595      | 8%   |\n| Total                                                                | 7,371,560    | 100% |\n\nA full analysis of the performance of investments is performed at each closing date. The investment portfolio does not show, line-by-line, any objective indication of significant impairment as of December 31, 2023 (as was the case on December 31, 2022).\n\nThese investments could be converted into cash depending on Group's operational purposes. Cash resources and its portfolio of marketable securities therefore allow the Group to meet its commitments without any liquidity risk. The Group is not faced with restrictions with regard to the availability of its cash and its portfolio of marketable securities.\n\n### **23.2. Credit and counterparty risks**\n\n#### **23.2.1. Credit risk on bank counterparties**\n\nThe Group allocates its investments and performs its cash and foreign exchange transactions with recognized financial institutions. The Group has no investments or accounts with financial institutions presenting a significant risk of default.\n\n#### **23.2.2. Customer default risk**\n\nThe Group limits counterparty risk by conducting most of its sales in cash and ensuring that the loans are secured by export insurance guarantees (Bpifrance Assurance Export) or collaterals. The share of receivables not covered by these procedures is subject to regular individual monitoring and, if necessary, a provision for impairment.\n\nGiven the arrangements in risk mitigation that are in place, and the provisions made in its accounts, the Group's residual exposure to the risk of default by a customer in a country subject to uncertainties is limited.\n\nThe Bpifrance Assurance Export guarantees and collateral obtained and not exercised as of the closing date are of the same nature as those as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe amount of Bpifrance Assurance Export guarantees and collaterals obtained and not exercised at year-end appears in the table of off-balance sheet commitments (see note 24).\n\nThe manufacturing risk is also guaranteed with Bpifrance Assurance Export for major military export contracts.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **23.3. Other market risks**\n\n### **23.3.1. Foreign exchange risk**\n\nThe Group covers risks from exchange rates using derivative financial instruments whose book value is presented below:\n\n| (in EUR thousands)                   | 12/31/2023 |             | 12/31/2022 |             |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Assets     | Liabilities | Assets     | Liabilities |\n| Exchange rate derivatives            | 58,694     | 29,440      | 23,086     | 111,019     |\n| Net derivative financial instruments | 29,254     |             |            | 87,933      |\n\nThe Group is exposed to a foreign exchange risk through the parent company in relation to its Falcon sales, which are mainly denominated in US dollars. This risk is partially hedged by using forward currency contracts and foreign exchange options.\n\nThe Group partially hedges its cash flows that are considered highly probable. It ensures that the initial future cash flows will be sufficient to use the foreign exchange hedges in place. The hedged amount may be adjusted in accordance with changes over time in expected net cash flows.\n\nThis risk is permanent, taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and volatility.

consolidated financial statements)<br><br>Dassault Aviation provides warranties for its aircraft deliveries against hardware or software defects and is required to correct any regulatory non-compliance identified after the delivery of the equipment. These warranties therefore constitute a commitment for the Company. The costs of this commitment must be provisioned upon delivery of the airplane.<br><br>The estimated amount of the provisions is based on the data and expenses recorded by airplane model and type of transactions warrantied and on estimated costs, in particular cost estimates for specialists, handling of malfunctions and regulatory non-compliance. Given the fleet in service and the variety of costs potentially incurred, provisions for warranties are determined by complex models that require judgments by several Operational Departments.<br><br>Management's valuation of these commitments caused Dassault Aviation to recognize provisions for warranties of EUR 878.6 million as at December 31, 2023.<br><br>The valuation of these provisions is a key point of the audit due to:<br>• the high level of judgment required for their determination,<br>• the complex nature of their valuation,<br>• their significant amount,<br>• and, consequently, the potentially significant impact on earnings and consolidated equity if their estimates vary. | On the basis of discussions with the relevant operational departments, we took note of the procedures to identify the risks to be guaranteed and the procedures put in place to determine the costs and other data used as a basis for the valuation of provisions for guarantees. We also tested the functioning of key controls that we considered relevant to our audit.<br><br>In addition, our work consisted of:<br>• assessing the adequacy of the funding methodology used by the Group's management and the judgments exercised by it,<br>• assessing, through discussions with the relevant operational departments, the reasonableness of the main assumptions used to determine provisions for guarantees,<br>• randomly testing the source data and observed costs used for the valuation of the provisions and the accuracy of the calculations made. |\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the board of directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial performance declaration required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report. Pursuant to Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. A report will be issued on this information by an independent third-party.\n\n#### **Other verification or information stipulated in Legal and Regulatory documents**\n\n#### *Annual accounts lay-out to be included in the annual financial report*\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Group Managing Director, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation n° 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limits inherent in the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we have no responsibility to verify that the annual accounts that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n#### *Appointment of the Statutory Auditors*\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Dassault Aviation Company by the General Meetings held on June 19, 1990 for Mazars and held on May 12, 2020 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs at December 31 2023, audit firm Mazars and audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit were in the 34th year and 4th of total uninterrupted engagement respectively.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were closed by the board of directors\n\n### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n### *Objectives and audit approach*\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n### *Report to the Audit Committee*\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N°537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. When appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nLes Commissaires aux comptes\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Mazars\n\nMazars\n\nEdouard Demarcq Erwan Candau\n\nErwan Candau\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThe statutory auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes explanatory paragraphs discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThis report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Financial statements parent company as of December 31,

General principles**\n\n### **1.1.1. General basis**\n\nThe financial statements of the Parent Company as of December 31, 2023 were closed by the board of directors on March 5, 2024, and will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024. The company financial statements are prepared in accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-03 on the French General Accounting Plan, which has since been updated by a series of amending regulations and by the subsequent opinions and recommendations of the French Accounting Standards Authority.\n\nThe methods used to present the financial statements are comparable year-on-year.\n\nThe general accounting conventions have been applied, in compliance with the principle of prudence, and in line with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- going concern of operations,\n- permanence of the accounting methods from one year to the next,\n- independence of fiscal years,\n\nand in line with the general rules for the establishment and presentation of annual financial statements. The individual financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost.\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could have an impact on the amounts reported in the balance sheet and in the income statement. Those estimates concern, in particular:\n\n- the results of contracts in progress,\n- the calculation of provisions for contingencies and charges and of impairments.\n\nThese estimations are calculated by taking into account past experience, items known at the closing date and any reasonable change assumptions. Subsequent results may therefore differ from such estimates.\n\n### **1.1.2. Impact of the global geopolitical context**\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which Russia started on February 24, 2022, triggered a major crisis in the aviation sector, leading to shortages and putting significant pressure on supplies. The risk is that it could have a lasting impact on the Company and its partners, sub-contractors and customers. The regulations adopted by the European Union and the United States are strictly enforced by the Company, especially the ban on commercial transactions and the restriction on financial transactions with sanctioned persons or entities. Some entities in the maintenance network in Europe have been significantly affected by the loss of Russian customers. Operations in Russia, the Moscow office and the Dassault Falcon Service maintenance subsidiary, have stopped doing business.\n\nAs of December 31, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.2. Valuation principles**\n\n#### **1.2.1. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition or production cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization and impairment. Interest expense is not capitalized.\n\nEach identified component of an intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment is recognized and depreciated or amortized separately.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. No residual value is taken into account, except for aircraft.\n\nDepreciation and amortization periods depend on their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each year-end for material assets. The initial useful life of an asset is extended or reduced if the conditions in which the asset is used justify it.\n\nInitial useful lives are determined as follows:\n\n| Software                            | 3-4 years               |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Industrial buildings                | 20-25 years             |\n| Office buildings                    | 20-25 years             |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 7-15 years              |\n| Plant, equipment and machinery      | 3-10 years              |\n| Aircraft                            | 10-15 years             |\n| Rolling stock                       | 4 years                 |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3-10 years              |\n| Used property                       | on a case-by-case basis |\n\n### **1.2.2. Impairment of assets**\n\nThe Company conducts an impairment test if an indication of loss of value has been detected. Indications of impairment come from significant long-term adverse changes that affect the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used by the Company.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are impaired by the Company when the net carrying amount exceeds their current value. The amount of impairment recognized in income is equal to the difference between the net carrying amount and current value. The current value of an asset is the higher of its market value (less selling costs) and its value in use.\n\nThe value in use is calculated using the discounted future cash flow method. Discount rates are reviewed each year. As of December 31, 2023 the after-tax discount rate was 9.8% (9.9% as of December 31, 2022). The value in use is determined on the basis of projected after-tax cash flows resulting from economic assumptions and estimated operating conditions used by Management and takes into account a terminal value.\n\n#### **1.2.3. Associates and other investment securities**\n\nGross values are represented by the purchase cost excluding incidental charges, except in the case of those subject to the 1976 legal revaluation. An impairment is recognized when the book value is lower than the gross value. The book value is the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nDassault Aviation assesses the book value for listed investment securities on the basis of the average quotation for the reporting month and for non-listed securities, in the absence of any external valuation elements, according to the share in net assets or the discounted cash flow method.\n\nConcerning the equity investment in Thales, when an impairment test is carried out, the operational and financial assumptions used come directly from data provided by Thales management.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.2.4. Inventories and work-in-progress**\n\nIncoming raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods inventories are measured at acquisition cost for items purchased and production cost for items produced. Outgoing inventories are valued at the weighted average cost, except for used aircraft which are stated at acquisition cost. Work-in-progress is stated at production cost and does not include abnormal production costs.\n\nInventories and work-in-progress are impaired when their net realizable value is less than their carrying amount.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs for completion and making the sale. It takes into account the technical or commercial obsolescence of articles and the risks associated with their low turnover.\n\n### **1.2.5. Receivables**\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is recognized when the recoverable value is lower than the carrying amount. The Company did not have to recognize any significant provisions, since its military trade receivables are represented by government customers and the vast majority of Falcon's sales are in cash.\n\n#### **1.2.6. Borrowings**\n\nBorrowings are recorded at the amount received. Transaction costs are posted to expenses for the year.\n\n### **1.2.7. Regulated provisions**\n\nRegulated tax provisions appearing on the balance sheet include provisions for price increases and depreciation by derogation.\n\n### **1.2.8. Provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n#### **Warranty provisions and other contract risks**\n\nDassault Aviation has formal obligations under sales or procurement contracts relating to the equipment, products and/or services delivered (software development, systems integration, etc.).\n\nThese obligations can be distinguished between:\n\n- \"current\" warranty: repair of defective equipment during the contractual warranty period or based on a constructive obligation, correcting hardware or software malfunctions identified following qualification and handover to users, etc.,\n- \"regulatory\" warranty: implementation by the manufacturer of any changes to the regulatory framework determined by the regulatory authorities or any regulatory non-compliance identified by the manufacturer or a user after delivery of equipment or products,\n- other risks in connection with the performance of the contract.\n\nThe amount of the provisions is mainly determined as follows:\n\n- on the basis of feedback on the costs incurred,\n- on the basis of quotes provided by specialists in the relevant fields.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Retirement payments and related benefits**\n\nA provision for remaining obligations of commitments to employees for retirement payments and related benefits is recorded. The commitments are estimated for all employees on the basis of vested rights and a projection of current salaries, after taking into account the mortality risk, employee turnover, and a discounting assumption. The rates used have been determined based on the yield for top-ranking corporate long-term bonds, with maturity equivalent to the duration of the calculated liabilities.\n\nActuarial gains or losses, or those gains or losses that are analyzed as such, are fully recognized in operating income in the period during which they are incurred. The provision that appears in the balance sheet is the amount of the total commitment net of outsourced amounts.\n\n### **1.2.9. Hedging instruments**\n\nThe Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nExchange rate risks mainly arise from US dollar-denominated sales. The corresponding future cash flows are partially hedged using forward exchange contracts and currency options.\n\nThe Company reviewed the highly probable nature of the flows associated with financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting and could find no evidence challenging this position at the end of December 2023.\n\nThe effects of the hedge, including the carrying forward/backwardation, are recorded at the rhythm of the hedged item and follow the same classification as the hedged item, i.e. the operating profit.\n\nPremiums paid or received on the potential purchase or sale of options are recognized as income only at the expiration of these options.\n\nHedging instruments that hedge balance sheet positions are accounted for in cash instruments.\n\n### **1.2.10. Foreign currency transactions**\n\nExpenses and income in foreign currencies are recognized at their equivalent value in euros on the date of the payment or settlement transaction, with the exception of the net flows associated with global foreign exchange hedging, which are recorded at the hedge rate for the year.\n\nCurrency receivables and payables outstanding at year-end are revalued into euros at the closing rate of exchange.\n\nWhen the application of the translation rate on the closing date has the effect of modifying the amounts in euros previously recognized, the currency translation differences are booked to transitory accounts:\n\n- under assets, when unrealized translation balance is a loss,\n- under liabilities, when unrealized translation balance is a gain.\n\nAn overall foreign exchange position is calculated by maturity of unhedged receivables and payables. When an overall foreign exchange position by maturity is an unrealized loss, a provision is set up for that risk.\n\nTranslation gains and losses arising on cash at bank and in hand as of December 31 are recognized on the income statement.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.2.11. Net sales and income**\n\nThe results on completion are based on estimates of net sales and costs at completion (taking into account the program departments' forecasts). These are revised as the contracts progress and take into account the latest known events at the closing date. The potential losses on completion are recognized as soon as they are known.\n\n### **Sales of goods and development contracts**\n\nNet sales and net income are recognized when Dassault Aviation has transferred the main risks and benefits of ownership to the buyer, and it is probable that the future economic benefits will benefit the Company.\n\nAs a general rule, net sales are recognized upon delivery of goods or development services. The corresponding costs are valued on the basis of net income at completion estimated in the contract. If the estimated costs are lower than the actual costs, the difference is classified as work-in-progress. If the estimated costs are higher than the actual costs, a provision for services and work still to be performed is recognized at closing.\n\n### **Other service contracts**\n\nIncome from sales of services is recognized under the percentage of completion method according to the milestones set forth in contracts. Income or loss is recognized at each stage of completion if it can be reliably measured.\n\nContracts involving co-contractors for which Dassault Aviation is the only signatory are recognized for the entire amount of net sales and related expenses (including the co-contractors' share).\n\n### **1.2.12. Marketable securities and cash instruments**\n\nThe item includes deposits with over three months term and debt securities which the Company does not intend to convert into cash in the short term for operational purposes. The item also includes cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nUnrealized capital gains on marketable securities are not recognized in the income statement until effectively realized. The tax charge relating to unrealized gains is recorded under prepayments until the gain is recognized in financial income.\n\nThis method, which constitutes an exception to the general principle of full recognition of deferred taxes, has been adopted to provide a fairer presentation of the Company's results.\n\nUnrealized capital losses on marketable securities are subject to a provision.\n\n### **1.2.13. Treasury shares**\n\nThe book value of treasury shares at year-end is determined by the average market price in the month before closing. If the market price is lower than the purchase value, an impairment is recorded, with the exception of securities being canceled or shares held for allotment under a defined plan.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.3. Tax consolidation**\n\nThe Company opted for the tax consolidation scheme in 1999, pursuant to Articles 223-A and following of the French General Tax Code. As of January 1, 2012, the tax consolidation scope of the Group includes Dassault Aviation, Dassault Aéro Service and Dassault Aviation Participations.\n\nThis tax consolidation arrangement is tacitly renewable per period of five fiscal years.\n\nBy agreement, it does not have an impact on the results of consolidated companies: tax liabilities are borne by the tax group companies as if no tax consolidation existed.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 2 - Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\n### **2.1.

Details of provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n(1) provisions for retirement payments and related benefits:\n\nRetirement payment commitments are calculated for all employees using the projected unit credit method. They are provisioned in full for the remaining obligations.\n\nEmployment projections are weighted using French insurance code mortality rates and the recorded employee turnover rate (this may vary according to age). The obligation depends on the employee's length of service at the end of the period relative to total career expectancy (see Note 1.2.8 of the valuation principles).\n\nThe calculation takes into account the following annual assumptions: discount rate of 2.6% and inflation rate of 2.4%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balance of the provision for long-service awards was EUR 3.1 million.\n\n(2) provisions for warranties and other contract risks:\n\nProvisions are updated to reflect changes to the fleet in service, deliveries during the period and contractual obligations induced by the execution of contracts.\n\n{268}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 15 -

also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law.\n\n### *Information given in the management report and in the other documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements*\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the board of directors and in the other documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n### *Report on corporate governance*\n\nWe attest that the board of directors report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code relating to remunerations and benefits received or attributed to the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nConcerning the information related to factors that your company have considered as likely to have an impact in case of a public takeover or swap bid, given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have verified its conformity with the source documents which we were provided. Based on this work, we have no remarks to make on this information.\n\n### *Other Information*\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n### **Other verification or information stipulated in Legal and Regulatory documents**\n\n#### *Annual accounts lay-out to be included in the annual financial report*\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Group Managing Director, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation n° 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Appointment of the Statutory Auditors*\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Dassault Aviation Company by the General Meetings held on June 19, 1990 for Mazars and held on May 12, 2020 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, audit firm Mazars and audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit were in the 34th year and 4th of total uninterrupted engagement respectively.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the board of directors.\n\n#### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**\n\n#### *Objectives and audit approach*\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or taken together, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n#### *Report to the Audit Committee*\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee that includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement which, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N°537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de Déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nFait à Neuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nLes Commissaires aux comptes\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Mazars\n\nEdouard Demarcq Erwan Candau\n\nErwan Candau\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThe statutory auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the financial statements.\n\nThis report also includes information relating to the specific verifications of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Photos**\n\nCover (photos): © Dassault Aviation - Airborne Films/A.

Every aspect of human activity is being viewed through this lens. The aviation industry is no exception, and rightly so, even though its CO2 emissions account for only around 2% of total human emissions. Our industry is committed to achieving \"net zero\" emissions by 2050, and is focusing on technological innovation to meet this target, in keeping with its long history of achievement in this regard. However, the assessment criteria need to be scientific and not ideological, as is sometimes the case when it comes to business aviation. In this respect, the EU taxonomy of economic activities that are environmentally sustainable is misguided, which is why we have called for it to be amended. The European Union is too often in the business of imposing restrictions and taxes, whereas the United States tends to favor incentives and greater streamlining.\n\nA host of questions are being raised. And many of these questions are going to be answered in 2024, with major elections scheduled in Europe and the United States, as well as in India.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Against this backdrop, how should the tremendous success of the Rafale in export markets be viewed?**\n\nThe Rafale began to make inroads in the export market in 2015, well before the invasion of Ukraine. So far, this attack has not prompted or boosted any of our commercial deals – quite the opposite, in fact. Responsible countries arm themselves in peacetime, in order to protect the peace. In times of conflict, however, everything becomes more challenging, as can be seen from the debate currently taking place in France in relation to the \"war economy.\" Producing complex weapons systems takes time. Given the length of manufacturing cycles, we need to be proactive when it comes to planning or stepping up production.\n\nThe Rafale's success stems from a combination of factors: the outstanding combat-tested qualities of the aircraft, the loyalty of our customers (all of whom were already using Mirage 2000, with the exception of Croatia and Indonesia), the changing geopolitical landscape (a multipolar world, with American power increasingly focused on Asia), and superb teamwork across the board in France (between political, military and industrial partners). To date, a total of 495 Rafale fighters have been ordered (519 if we include pre-owned aircraft, i.e., an export rate of 55%). And the momentum is showing no signs of slowing: we're continuing to step up our pace of production; we're in commercial negotiations with a number of countries; we're developing the F4 standard, featuring advanced connectivity capabilities; and we're preparing the F5 standard, which will include a combat drone.\n\n#### **Can you tell us about the outlook for the Falcon business?**\n\nIn the short term, we have a number of supply chain problems to deal with. Supplier failures combined with a lack of industrial capacity, mainly with regard to aerostructures, have resulted in delays to production launches. We have made adjustments to existing organizational arrangements and put in place a centralized management system to implement corrective action plans, provide the necessary support to some of our subcontractors and expand our operations in India. We are also aiming to grow our sales. In 2023, the delay in the certification and entry into service of the Falcon 6X meant that we were unable to start\n\nusing a demonstrator to showcase the aircraft until December; since the launch of this promotional campaign, the 6X's exceptional levels of performance have met with an enthusiastic response from current and prospective customers.\n\nIn the longer term, our focus is on completing development work on the Falcon 10X. We have recalibrated the project to allow for the backlogs that built up during and after the Covid crisis. Initial deliveries of this aircraft are now scheduled for 2027. Lastly, we are pursuing our efforts in the area of decarbonization, focusing on four key priorities: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, R&T, flight operations optimization and CO2 storage.\n\nIn light of these efforts as well as of our exceptionally healthy order book, we will need to maintain high levels of hiring: in 2023, we hired some 2,000 new employees, and we have set ourselves the same target for 2024. Dassault Aviation rates highly in all \"respected employer\" rankings. Our Group is an excellent place to work, whether you are an engineer, a technician or a skilled worker, whether your background is in design, production or support functions, whether you wish to work in France or overseas, or whether you are interested in the civil or military sector: we offer skilled men and women the opportunity to pursue varied and exciting careers, working together in the service of France and its aviation sector.\n\n> The company's top priority continues to be delivering Falcon and Rafale aircraft on time, thus ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>**Executive Committee**\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/4 description: A group of 17 people are standing in a room.

In the Universum 2023 ranking of the 130 most attractive employers among engineering school students in all fields, we came in among the top five; in addition, we were ranked in the top three most popular manufacturing companies among engineering students and graduates, according to an Epoka survey, based on a sample of 15,000 students and graduates.\n\n### **Reduced environmental footprint**\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Dassault Aviation and the ADP Group announced a five-year agreement to step up their efforts to reduce carbon emissions at Paris-Le Bourget airport.\n\nDassault Aviation was included in the *Financial Times*' Europe's Climate Leaders 2023 rankings of the top 300 European companies. This list features the companies that have made the greatest efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFalconWays, an innovative tool for optimizing flight plans to reduce kerosene consumption and CO2 emissions, was awarded the Aviation Week Laureate Award in November 2023.\n\nIn addition, Dassault Aviation has become a major corporate sponsor of the Maubuisson forest in the Val-d'Oise department of France.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Dynamic **Shaping the future**\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic 2023 Annual Report Dassault Aviation 17\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: A man walks past an aircraft in a hangar. The text \"18 Dassault Aviation 2023 Annual Report Dynamic\" is visible in the upper left corner of the image.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Proud of our model**\n\n**Operating in an unpredictable environment in which taking a very long‑term view is key, our fundamentals are solid. Our strength lies in a unique development model and very loyal customers. We owe our longevity to our ability to envision the future and adapt to new challenges.**\n\n### **Strategic mission**\n\nWe play a key part in France's national defense by supplying military aircraft, as well as by providing associated support. We have acquired strategic expertise in the design and management of a high-performance and reliable air combat system. Fighter aircraft and their accompanying operational systems constitute the cornerstones of security and deterrence in the face of significant threats.\n\nDassault Aviation manufactures conventional combat systems. The export of military hardware is the exclusive prerogative of the French government, and is subject to a stringent system of regulatory controls.\n\n### **Dual expertise: civil and military**\n\nOur dual civil-military expertise means that we can count on markets with different business cycles, thus reducing our exposure to fluctuating economic conditions. Our civil and military jet aircraft are designed in the same department and manufactured in the same plants. The state-of-the-art technology developed for military use also benefits our civil aviation business, which in turn generates innovations in terms of production and certification.\n\n### **Governance and family values**\n\nDassault Aviation is the only aerospace group in the world that is still owned by the family of its founder, Marcel Dassault. This unwavering backing from our main shareholder ensures the stability of our management team: Eric Trappier is only the fifth CEO in a century. This enables us to take a long-term view, which is a major asset in aviation where cycles stretch over decades: an aircraft may well stay in production for 25 years and remain in service for 40 years or more.\n\nOur stability allows us to uphold the values that have driven Dassault Aviation's success: technical excellence and innovation; a passion for aeronautics; quick strategic decisions; adaptability in the face of change; the determination to meet objectives; efficient management and competitiveness; and a human resources policy designed to attract and retain top talent.\n\n### **Profit‑sharing**\n\nDassault Aviation takes a unique approach to sharing profits with its French employees, based on fair distribution: under special agreements, €170 million in profit-sharing and incentive payments were redistributed based on 2023 financial results. €266 million in dividends were proposed to our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024. Dassault Aviation pays the bulk of its taxes in France: 83% in 2023, which represented a contribution of some €539 million to the public purse.\n\nCivil and military aircraft, all produced by the same design office and in the same plants\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Shaping technological innovation**\n\n**As an industrial architect and systems integrator, it is vital to be able to develop and implement cutting‑edge technologies, and to harness data. Dassault Aviation possesses this rare ability, making it a pivotal player in aerospace R&D in France and Europe, in both civil and military aviation.**\n\n### **Substantial investments**\n\nOur commitment to innovation is evidenced by our R&D budget: €539 million in financed R&D and €483 million in self-financed R&D. Our current development projects include the Rafale F4 and Export standards, the FCAS, Falcon 10X, Falcon 8X Archange, Falcon 2000 Albatros and drones.\n\nDassault Aviation is the only major French aerospace company to make the prestigious *Leaders de l'innovation en France* list. Published in 2023 by *Les Echos* newspaper and Statista, this ranking recognizes innovation in products and processes, as well as companies' overall corporate commitment to innovation.\n\n### **Meeting environmental challenges**\n\nWe are determined that business aviation continue to be a key driver in the decarbonization of the aviation sector. Our aircraft are ideally suited to the incorporation of innovations that help reduce CO2 emissions. Our customers, most of whom are companies, are fully behind us in this approach. We are exploring a number of technological solutions, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which we regard as highly promising: over its life cycle, SAF emits 80% to 90% less CO2 than fossil kerosene. Our Falcons are already equipped to fly with SAF containing 50% non-fossil fuel.\n\n### **Civil aviation research in France**\n\nRight from the design stage and throughout their life cycle, we are actively reducing the environmental footprint of our aircraft. As part of France's civil aviation research council (Corac), we are actively involved in a series of technology maturation projects aimed at achieving sustainability in aviation.\n\n### **European cooperation**\n\nSince 2008, the Clean Sky 1 and 2 programs have enabled us to collaborate with some twenty major partners in seven European countries. We are continuing with our efforts in this area by heading up the Clean Aviation program's Concerto project.\n\nSesar, a European joint-undertaking devoted to improving air traffic management, has contributed to the development of our FalconEye system, which provides safe access to all airports in poor weather conditions, including those with limited technical resources.\n\n### **Artificial intelligence (AI)**\n\nWe are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to enhance the operational performance of aviation, with a view to harnessing the full potential of the concept of collaborative combat. Our teams are involved in proof-of-concept research with academics and leading companies in the field.\n\n€483 million in self‑financed R&D expenditures\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nPULL AND TURN\n\nZAM\n\nCOCKPIT LIGHTS\n\n30\n\nVINXS-20UN-TTSL-HTC?\n\n1000 3000\n\nso\n\nEMERG GEAR-\n\n21\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/1 description: This image shows two fighter jets in a simulated environment.

We add value through our ability to manage, coordinate and guarantee the ultimate efficacy of the systems delivered by the projects we lead.\n\nGuarantor of the system's underlying fundamentals and its development, we are responsible for assessing the technological challenges as well as the scope and sharing of tasks between partners.\n\n### **Design architect**\n\nOur approach to product design is focused on harnessing data. Deployed as part of combat bubbles, our future weapons systems need to enable humans to maintain their position at the helm of the decision-making process, while ensuring operational performance in the midst of high-intensity operations and in situations involving contested network conditions. This will be achieved by means of collaborative combat, automated systems based partly on AI, as well as adaptive and resilient system architectures.\n\n### **Rafale road map**\n\nThe Rafale continues to surge ahead thanks to a combination of technological advances and user feedback. Its F3-R standard, launched in 2014, entered service in December 2019. The F4 standard, with its focus on connectivity and enhanced payloads, will be validated in 2027. The launch of the planned F5 standard, designed for collaborative combat, is currently underway.\n\n### **New Falcons**\n\nThe Falcon 6X, launched in 2018, received joint certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in August 2023.\n\nThe Falcon 10X was unveiled in May 2021. Delivery of the first aircraft will begin in 2027, following revision of the timetable.\n\n### **Special‑mission Falcons**\n\nThe Falcon 10X is one of the two aircraft selected by the French defense procurement agency (DGA) in December 2022 for inclusion in a system design project aimed at developing a future maritime patrol aircraft to replace the ATL2.\n\nThe contract for the maritime surveillance Falcon Albatros (AVSIMAR) was officially announced in December 2020.\n\nThe Archange airborne strategic intelligence program was launched in December 2019. It will be based on the Falcon 8X jet, equipped with electronic warfare systems designed by Thales.\n\n### **Cooperation on demonstrators**\n\nThe nEUROn is the first stealth combat drone (UCAV) to date to be developed as part of a joint European program. Dassault Aviation is the lead partner in this program and the Rafale F5's combat drone will be developed on the basis of this demonstrator.\n\nThe Future Combat Air System (FCAS) Phase 1B contract for R&T and overall flying demonstrator design commenced in March 2023. As prime contractor and architect of the New Generation Fighter NGF (Pillar 1), Dassault Aviation has brought together the manufacturing teams from all three partner countries at its facility in Saint-Cloud.\n\nForesight from experience, leadership through expertise\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Digital technology driving innovation and our development strategy**\n\n**Our capabilities as a system architect draw on major digital technologies, ranging from 3D creation to big data. For more than forty years, we have been among the pioneers in this industrial revolution.**\n\n### **Digital DNA**\n\nEver since the revolutionary advent of 3D modeling, we have been investing in digital innovations. This was the crucible that forged Dassault Systèmes, our long-standing partner. Our links with the world leader in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions provide us with the expertise and methods needed to adapt these powerful technologies to our industrial activities. The new tools we are deploying also enhance our ability to look ahead and take a comprehensive view – from design through production, and right down to support and the user experience.\n\n### **3DExperience platform**\n\nIn 2018, the decision was made to transition to 3DExperience, Dassault Systèmes' unified platform, which has replaced all existing PLM solutions used in our civil and military aircraft programs. The development of the new Falcon and future combat aircraft is taking place using this platform.\n\n### **Data sovereignty**\n\nWe are currently using the 3DExperience platform on Dassault Systèmes' sovereign cloud as part of the European FCAS program, as well as to support the operational readiness of aircraft operated by the French armed forces. Our partnership with Dassault Systèmes is the first collaborative engineering solution designed specifically to meet the cyber requirements of defense programs. This represents a significant step towards the creation of a sovereign European cloud.\n\n### **Collaborative system engineering**\n\nThis approach involves using a shared digital model to coordinate everybody involved in the development of large airborne systems. Implemented as part of the ATL2 modernization project, this framework is currently being applied as part of the FCAS/NGF collaborative project and is being used for our new programs. The system digital model allows security and data sovereignty considerations to be incorporated very early in the process.\n\n### **Analysis, decision‑making and big data**\n\nBig data is used to optimize support for our civil and military customers. It enables the deployment of management, analysis and decision-making tools, based on strictly controlled and sovereign shared data. The digital twin of each aircraft replicates the various phases of its life cycle. This enables us to engage in predictive maintenance to improve the effectiveness of the support we provide and to maximize fleet availability.\n\nDesign, manufacture, support: towards a comprehensive digital vision\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nX\n\nROOT\n\n55528BE080055\n\nT\n\nen iup zepéig zonishe\n\n226T\n\n2000\n\nbadbee\n\nnoitexit 6119tqanl\n\n19 12 555288E0800JS\n\nel abst2 90 6 299tnom\n\n6j9b troz\n\n10 6 כוסqq61 169\n\nto atelit 2.1 = inim)\n\n(atelit 2. = xsm\n\n129 ziv al sup 19ítireν\n\nimbo 1956 19\n\nziv eb ståt sl\n\n96 2GLL906 9\n\n66\n\n• Aşe dine je conbje\n\nebis'l é supilqqs\n\nE9l91922691x3upitixi\n\n٢٢٣٥+S=29912 T\n\nSSS28BE08001ST\n\n55528BE080045Г\n\n5552808001\n\n28000\n\nMS10080388488\n\n25\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Dassault Aviation** 2023 Annual ReportDynamic\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Gearing up for the future**\n\n**Our ongoing efforts to enhance both our manufacturing processes and our production ecosystem are key to achieving the high levels of quality and competitiveness demanded by the global market. Our manufacturing system is focused on the adjustment of our supply chain and the expansion of our operations in India.**\n\n### **Made in India**\n\nThe 2016 contract for 36 Rafales has strengthened our 70-year relationship with India thanks to an increased sharing of workloads and technologies, resulting in sustained benefits in terms of competitiveness. Since 2020, our Nagpur plant, located in the state of Maharashtra, has been producing Falcon 2000 front fuselage sections. The ramp-up in production has resulted in the addition of a second 135,000-sq.-foot production facility.\n\n### **Growth of the Indian supply chain**\n\nDassault Aviation is helping to develop the Indian supply chain, by expanding its network of local partners. We have qualified major new Indian subcontractors, most notably Dynamatic (for the manufacture of the Falcon 6X T5 section fuel tank and the supply of primary parts) and Aerolloy, a subsidiary of the PTC Group (for development of a titanium foundry).\n\n### **Adjusting our ecosystem**\n\nSupplier failures combined with a lack of industrial capacity, mainly with regard to aerostructures, have resulted in delays to production launches and missed manufacturing deadlines. To remedy this situation, we have made adjustments to existing organizational arrangements and put in place a centralized management system to implement corrective action plans, provide the necessary support to some of our subcontractors and expand our operations in India.\n\nOur SAP production management system, used across all our plants, has improved our industrial performance and our responsiveness with regard to our supply chain.\n\n### **Investment in our industrial infrastructure**\n\nWe are pursuing investment in our industrial infrastructure, specifically in preparation for the introduction of the Falcon 10X: a building to house the 10X simulator, in Istres; a building devoted to wing box systems, in Martignas; and refitting of the buildings where final assembly and special projects will take place, in Mérignac. We are also continuing construction work on our new Cergy plant, which is slated for completion in 2024.\n\nAdapting to sustain quality and competitiveness\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Corporate Social Responsibility **Higher, together**\n\n<span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**28 Dassault Aviation** 2023 Annual ReportCorporate Social Responsibility\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: A group of men are standing around a table in what appears to be an aircraft manufacturing facility. They are examining aircraft parts. The text on the table reads \"B BORICHARSKY NANTERRE SEINE\". A box of copier paper is visible under the table. The text on the box reads \"COPIER PAPER A4 WHITE LASER COPIER A4 210 x 297mm 80 g/m\".\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **People‑driven performance**\n\n**Our strength lies in the individual and collective performance of our people and in their passion for aerospace. Over the course of 2023, we hired some 2,000 people, including more than 200 apprentices.**\n\n### **Respected employer**\n\nDassault Aviation is ranked sixth, across all categories, in Statista's ranking of France's top 500 employers, and first in the Aerospace, Rail and Naval category. This ranking, published by *Capital* magazine in January 2024, is based on a sample of 20,000 employees working for companies with 500 employees or more.\n\nFor the past decade, Dassault Aviation has been ranked by engineering school students as one of the top ten companies to work for. In the Universum 2023 ranking of the 130 most attractive employers among engineering school students in all fields, we once again came in among the top five.\n\nIn addition, we were ranked in the top three most popular manufacturing companies among students and graduates, according to an Epoka/ Harris Interactive survey.\n\nLastly, we have been recognized as one of the 100 most responsible French companies in the Statista CSR ranking published by *Le Point* magazine.\n\n### **Hiring and integrating talent**\n\nIn 2023, the Dassault Aviation Group hired some 2,000 new employees, including more than 200 apprentices.\n\nThis large-scale hiring effort includes a rigorous induction process for new recruits, including, for example, the organization of *Envol* training days and the involvement of the Dassault Aviation Defense Academy, as well as a strengthened skills development and training plan. At the same time, the company is working to develop its talent pool through professional retraining initiatives, specifically the Diploma in Advanced Metalworking (CQPM) program for fitters and metalworkers, and the School of Mechanical Systems, established at our Argonay plant.\n\nWe are focused on providing our employees with skills and ensuring equal opportunities for all. Dassault Aviation is committed to promoting the careers of its female employees. In partnership with the Elles bougent and AirEmploi associations, we are helping to promote scientific and technical careers among secondary school girls.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/14 description: A high-angle shot captures a group of approximately 20 people standing on an asphalt surface, their arms raised in a celebratory gesture. They are positioned between two aircraft: a gray fighter jet on the left and a white private jet on the right. The fighter jet is a single-engine aircraft with a pointed nose and a visible cockpit. The private jet is larger, with two engines mounted on the rear fuselage and a set of stairs extended from the door. The group consists of men and women dressed in a variety of attire, including flight suits, business casual wear, and high-visibility vests. The background features a large, hangar-like building with a grid of windows. The overall lighting suggests a bright, sunny day.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/1 description: Two people are sitting in the cockpit of an airplane. The woman on the left is pointing at a tablet that the man on the right is holding. Both are wearing black jackets and hats. The cockpit is filled with various screens and controls.\n\n### **Training in India**\n\nThe Dassault Skill Academy program is designed to support the growth of our manufacturing operations in India. Our engineering center in Pune is fully operational. We have established the Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter diploma program in the state of Maharashtra, and we are in the process of expanding it to the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n### **Profit‑sharing**\n\nOur compensation policy is designed to attract, reward and foster employee loyalty, while remaining attuned to evolving economic circumstances. Our incentives policy is extremely competitive: in 2023, the average amount of profit-sharing and incentive payments made to Dassault Aviation parent company employees in respect of the 2022 fiscal year, was equivalent to four months' salary.\n\nPromoting diversity and training\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Environmental footprint management**\n\n**We are implementing an energy efficiency plan focusing on four key priorities to cut emissions generated by business aviation: SAF sustainable fuels, flight operations optimization, research & technology and CO2 storage.**\n\n### **Business aviation and carbon emissions**\n\nWe are committed to reducing emissions to achieve the worldwide target of carbon neutrality in the aviation sector by 2050.\n\nIn one year, the 2,100 Falcon jets in operation emit the equivalent of a day's worth of global video streaming, 5 hours' worth of global truck traffic, or 2.5 days' worth of German fossil fuel power production. Business aviation accounts for 0.04% of global CO2 emissions.\n\n### **EU taxonomy**\n\nWe have filed an action for annulment with the General Court of the European Union against the regulation excluding business aviation from the European taxonomy of sustainable economic activities. This action is based primarily on a breach of the principle of equality with respect to the other categories of aircraft included in the taxonomy. It also highlights a manifest misunderstanding, as business aviation is a key driver in the decarbonization of the aviation sector.\n\n### **Sustainable fuels plan**\n\nIn 2023, Dassault Aviation operated 413 Falcon flights using 30% SAF blends, compared with 179 in 2022. These flights resulted in CO2 savings of 681 tonnes over the course of the year.\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Dassault Aviation and the ADP Group announced a five-year agreement to step up their efforts to reduce carbon emissions at Paris-Le Bourget airport: supply and use of SAF, electrification of ground operations, geothermal energy to power buildings and hangars.\n\n### **Research and technology**\n\nWe are actively involved in the European Clean Aviation initiative, as well as in France's civil aviation research council (Corac). Our work is focused particularly on cutting fuel consumption by reducing aircraft drag, as well as by the use of SAF.\n\n### **Optimizing flight operations**\n\nDassault Aviation has developed FalconWays, an innovative tool for optimizing flight plans, which was awarded the *Aviation Week Laureate Award* in November 2023. The proven reductions in fuel consumption achieved are up to 7%.\n\nOur other contributions to optimizing air traffic operations include advances in flexibility, avionics, flight controls and the FalconEye Combined Vision System (CVS).\n\n### **CO2 storage**\n\nIn addition, Dassault Aviation is a major corporate sponsor of the Maubuisson forest in the Val-d'Oise department of France. Thanks to the planting of a million trees of thirty different species on an unused lowland plain, this 3,300-acre forest will benefit the 100,000 inhabitants of the seven neighboring towns as well as twelve million people living in the Greater Paris region.\n\n### **Energy efficiency plan**\n\nOur energy efficiency plan, launched at the end of 2022, began to produce significant results in 2023. Our consumption of energy (electricity, gas, fuel oil) fell by 13.5% compared with 2019 levels.\n\nWe are one of the European companies that have achieved the greatest reductions according to the *Financial Times*'s Europe's Climate Leaders 2023 ranking.\n\n### **The circular economy**\n\nOur careful approach to waste management means that we have achieved a recovery rate of 86%, and our efforts are ongoing. For instance, we are pioneers when it comes to the recycling of composite waste materials.\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuels, energy efficiency\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nFlight Card Trajectory\n\n410 Update Weather\n\nNEW TRAJECTORY\nComputation success!\nTIME (min) -3 FUEL -1635\nCO₂ (t) -2.34\nCancel Apply Details\n\nLFPS\n\n08:00\n500\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n\nVASB\n\n4116 NM\neDispatch FalconPert eWB EPM Store\n\n33\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/0 description: A woman is holding a book with the title \"CODE ANTICORRUPTION\" and the Dassault Aviation logo on the cover.

The Ethics and Compliance department, an independent body which reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is tasked with implementing measures to fight corruption and influence peddling, and closely monitoring performance in these areas.\n\n### **Compliance system**\n\nDassault Aviation has set up a rigorous and highly organized system for ethical compliance, based on the following procedures and tools:\n\n- an anti-corruption code which is incorporated into our internal regulations and which defines the different types of prohibited behaviors; and an anti-corruption guide that shows how this code works in practice, with specific examples and exercises;\n- an internal alert procedure, enabling employees and outside partners to report any breaches and violations of our anti-corruption or CSR/ due diligence regulations;\n- a chart of risks to identify, analyze and rank corruption exposure risks and the steps to be taken to reduce them;\n- procedures for assessing how customers, tier-1 suppliers and consultants are performing in relation to this chart;\n- internal and external accounting control procedures;\n- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance procedures.\n\nAn internal assessment and control process, run by the Audit and Risk Management Department, is also in place to support this system.\n\n### **Vigilance plan**\n\nTo ensure optimum management of the risks of serious harm to the environment, occupational health and safety, human rights and fundamental freedoms, Dassault Aviation has set up a legally-mandated vigilance plan covering its subsidiaries and suppliers. In 2023, 385 additional suppliers underwent assessment under this plan.\n\n### **Training policy**\n\nIn 2023, 755 \"at-risk\" employees received training in the key aspects of the so-called \"Sapin 2\" law and about the need to combat corruption. An e-learning program designed to raise awareness among employees was also launched and, by the end of 2023, had been completed by 3,030 employees.\n\nA robust and well‑organized compliance system\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>Image /page/37/Picture/0 description: Two people are walking in front of a Dassault Aviation civil and military aircraft.

In addition to France, seven other countries have placed their trust in the Rafale fighter. At the beginning of 2024, we had confirmed orders for 495 Rafales, including 261 for export. These orders will ensure a steady production output for the next ten years.**\n\n### **Combat proven**\n\nThe Rafale is one of the world's most seasoned fighter jets. It has demonstrated its outstanding versatility in some of the most challenging operational environments. It can handle a variety of missions that previously required seven different types of aircraft. The Rafale is one of the key components of the French system of nuclear deterrence.\n\nAt the end of December 2023, the French defense procurement agency (DGA) placed an order with Dassault Aviation for 42 Rafales (otherwise known as Tranche 5) for the French Air and Space Force. These aircraft are scheduled for delivery between 2027 and 2032. Total orders placed by the French Ministry of the Armed Forces since the start of the program, up to and including the end of December 2023, stand at 234 Rafales. Out of these, 164 have already been delivered.\n\n### **Upcoming Rafale standards**\n\nThe Rafale has been designed to be able to incorporate new features throughout its service life based on operational feedback. The F4 standard, currently under development for delivery in 2027, features enhanced networked combat capabilities. This standard will also include upgrades of the radar and OSF search & track systems, helmet-mounted display, along with Mica NG air-to-air missiles and 1,000-kg AASM precision-guided weapons.\n\nThe F5 standard, which is currently being readied for launch, will be designed for collaborative combat and the advanced weapon systems of the future: it will feature, among other things, a fourth-generation nuclear missile system and a combat drone based on the nEUROn demonstrator.\n\nImage /page/39/Picture/11 description: The image shows a large group of fighter jets parked on an airfield.

There is some mist or smoke around the base of the jet, possibly from the engines or landing gear. The overall impression is one of power and technology, with the human element of the ground crew adding a sense of scale and context.\n\n### **Rafale momentum in export markets**\n\nIn 2022, Indonesia signed a contract to purchase the Rafale. At the start of 2024, the contract for a total of 42 aircraft came into effect. Indonesia is a first-time military customer and our second Rafale customer in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIndia ordered 36 Rafales in 2016. In July 2023, the Indian government chose the Rafale Marine for use by the Indian Navy, with a potential order for 26 aircraft as the next step.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates purchased 80 Rafale F4s in 2021, which is the largest military export order ever secured by Dassault Aviation.\n\nOn top of an initial purchase of 24 aircraft in 2015, Egypt announced an order for 31 further fighters in 2021.\n\nQatar has bought a total of 36 Rafales – 24 in 2015, and a further 12 in 2017.\n\nGreece is the first European country to purchase the Rafale. An order for 6 new and 12 pre-owned Rafales was placed in 2021, followed by an order in 2022 for a further 6 new fighters.\n\nIn 2021, Croatia joined the ranks of Dassault customers by purchasing 12 pre-owned Rafales. Dassault Aviation has been contracted to provide maintenance for this fleet of aircraft.\n\n### **ATL2 and special Falcons**\n\nOur ATL2 maritime patrol aircraft, which play a key role in France's system of nuclear deterrence, are currently undergoing modernization. The seventh and last ATL2 to be upgraded to standard 6 by Dassault Aviation was delivered in 2023.\n\nWork on the Falcon 8X Archange strategic intelligence aircraft is continuing (two ordered, with an option for one more).\n\nThe French Navy placed an order for 7 Falcon Albatros jets in 2020. These maritime surveillance and intervention aircraft (AVSIMAR), based on the Falcon 2000LXS, are currently in the development phase and 12 aircraft are expected to be produced in due course.\n\nThe Republic of Korea has taken delivery of 2 out of the 4 Falcon 2000s it ordered in 2022.\n\n> Highly versatile, combat proven\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Falcon, enabling decisive meetings**\n\n**Our Falcons are state‑of‑the‑art business jets designed for the most exacting missions.

It stands at EUR 38.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 (295 aircraft - 141 Rafale Export, 70 Rafale France and 84 Falcon). Post-closing of the 2023 financial statements, the backlog increased with the entry into force in January 2024 of the third batch of 18 Rafale of the Indonesian contract. A total of 495 Rafale have thus been ordered since the beginning of the program.** \n\n**Certification of the Falcon 6X by EASA and FAA (type certificate) has been approved on August 22nd, 2023, the entry into service of the aircraft including the application of post certification upgrades happened on November 30th 2023. The first delivery took place in February 2024.** \n\n**13 Rafale and 26 Falcon were delivered, versus a guidance of 15 and 35, due to supply chain issues and the delayed entry into service of Falcon 6X.**\n\n**Group's Revenues for this year stood at EUR 4.8 billion, leading to an adjusted EBIT of EUR 349 million and a record breaking adjusted net result of EUR 886 million, representing 18.5% of net sales.**\n\nIn 2023, the international context deteriorated, marked by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. France adopted an ambitious Military Procurement Law (Loi de Programmation Militaire - LPM), which allocates a budget of EUR 413 billion for the 2024-2030 period (representing an increase of 40% compared to the previous LPM). For Dassault Aviation, the LPM provides for the ongoing deliveries of the Rafale program fourth batch, the coming into force of the 42 aircraft of the fifth batch (20 of which are to be delivered from 2027 to 2030), the completion by 2027 of the Rafale Standard F4, the negotiation and beginning of Rafale Standard F5 which should come along with the development of a combat drone.\n\nSupply chain issues that arose during the Covid crisis continue to have a severe impact on subcontractors in the aviation industry, which are not always able to deliver the required quality or meet deadlines. Certain supplier weaknesses, coupled with capacity shortages, mainly in aerostructure, resulted for the Group in delays in production start-ups. While these risks will continue to weigh on the Group's business in 2024, Dassault Aviation has implemented a centralized steering plan to introduce corrective measures, provide the necessary support to certain sub-contractors and develop \"Make in India.\"\n\nThe Paris Le Bourget Air Show was held in June 2023. This trade show allowed Dassault Aviation to once again showcase the efforts it has undertaken to decarbonize its processes and products, and those that it will continue to pursue in the years to come. The Group is committed to its decarbonization: the Falcon aircraft are certified to fly with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends with kerosene up to 50%. Today's available alternative fuels (SAF) offer a carbon emission reduction's rate in the range of 80% to 90% compared to conventional kerosene. All Dassault Aviation flights, including those in the United States, are using 30% SAF blends which are the only ones available on the market today. 413 flights have been operated in 2023 by Dassault Aviation with 30% SAF blends (vs. 179 in 2022). Aircraft models currently under production will be compatible with 100% SAF blends by 2030 (Falcon 10X natively).\n\nIn the military sector, 2023 saw:\n\n- the order by France for 42 Rafale placed in December 2023 under the country's new Military Procurement Law which was adopted in July 2023,\n- the addition to the backlog of the second batch of 18 Rafale under the Indonesian contract (followed on January 8, 2024 by the entry into force of a third batch of 18 aircraft),\n- the delivery of 11 Rafale to France,\n- the delivery of 2 new Rafale to Greece, as well as 6 pre-owned Rafale,\n- the continuation of development work on the Rafale F4 standard and the FCAS, for which Dassault Aviation is leader for the NGF demonstrator,\n- the continuation of work on the Eurodrone contract. Dassault Aviation is responsible in particular for flight controls and mission communications as a sub-contractor,\n- in the field of military support, the Group has met the availability commitments of its operational maintenance contracts (Ravel for the Rafale, Ocean for the ATL2 and Balzac for the Mirage 2000),\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nand participated in \"High Intensity\" warfare exercises with the French forces. At the end of December, a new verticalized maintenance contract was notified: \"Alphacare\" for the Alpha Jet. Moreover, support for fleets in service for Export customers continued as close as possible to operations.\n\nIn the civil aviation segment, 23 Falcon were ordered and 26 Falcon were delivered in 2023, compared with a guidance of 35.\n\nThe year also saw:\n\n- the continuation of development efforts on the Falcon 6X and 10X:\n\t- o The Falcon 6X was certified on August 22, 2023 and entered into service on November 30, 2023. Prospection has been stepped up, notably thanks to a demonstration aircraft. The flights operated allowed the first customers to confirm the cabin's very high level of comfort. The ramp up of production also continued, in a challenging supply chain context,\n\t- o the first Falcon 10X (development aircraft) is currently being built. The program schedule has been adjusted and the first deliveries are scheduled for 2027.\n- the expansion of the network of service centers, notably with the opening of the service center in Dubai (to replace the previous center).\n\nSocial and environmental responsibility was reflected in 2023 through:\n\n- the Company's commitment to the environment and to the decarbonization of its Falcon aircraft, in particular with:\n\t- o significant results for the Parent Company's energy saving plan which was launched at the end of 2022: -10.4% of energy consumption per hour worked,\n\t- o the ramp-up of the \"SAF plan\" which set an ambitious target for the use of SAF for its internal flights (413 flights operated with \"30% SAF\" blends in 2023 compared with 179 in 2022),\n\t- o the entry into service of the flight plan optimization tool FalconWays.\n- a major recruitment drive and an attractive employment model in which true to the ideals of Serge and Marcel Dassault – value sharing is a core part of its DNA with notably:\n\t- o almost 2,000 new hires, including 200 apprentices, in a tight labor market,\n\t- o based on the 2023 profits, profit-sharing and incentives reached EUR 170 million (for employees of the Group's French companies , including the corresponding employer's tax) compared with the minimum legal profit-sharing of EUR 8 million.\n\nThe Board of Directors would like to congratulate all the Group's employees for the past year's success and express its confidence in achieving the objectives for the coming year\"\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.

Definition of alternative performance indicators**\n\nTo reflect the Group's actual economic performance, and for monitoring and comparability reasons, the Group presents an income statement adjusted with the following elements:\n\n- gains and losses resulting from the exercise of hedging instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS standards. This income, presented as financial income in the consolidated financial statements, is reclassified as net sales and thus as operating income in the adjusted income statement,\n- the valuation of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting, by neutralizing the change in fair value of these instruments (the Group considering that gains or losses on hedging should only impact income as commercial flows occur), with the exception of derivatives allocated to hedge balance sheet positions whose change in fair value is presented as operating income,\n- amortization of assets valued as part of the purchase price allocation (business combinations), known as \"PPA\",\n- adjustments made by Thales in its financial reporting.\n\nThe Group also presents the \"available cash\" indicator, which reflects the amount of the Group's total liquidities, net of financial debt. It covers the following balance sheet items:\n\n- cash and cash equivalents,\n- other current financial assets,\n- financial debt, excluding lease liabilities.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 9).\n\nOnly consolidated financial statements are audited by statutory auditors.\n\nAdjusted financial data are subject to the verification procedures applicable to all information provided in the annual report.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.3.

Order intake**\n\n**2023 order intake** was **EUR 8,253 million** versus EUR 20,954 million in 2022. **Export** order intake represented **64%**.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|                    | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Defense            | 6,524 | 17,510 | 9,165  |\n| Defense Export     | 3,583 | 15,657 | 6,173  |\n| Defense France     | 2,941 | 1,853  | 2,992  |\n| Falcon             | 1,729 | 3,444  | 2,915  |\n| Total order intake | 8,253 | 20,954 | 12,080 |\n| % Export           | 64%   | 90%    | 74%    |\n\nThe order intake is composed entirely of firm orders.\n\n### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **Defense order intake** totaled **EUR 6,524 million**, compared with EUR 17,510 million in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense Export** share amounted **EUR 3,583 million** in 2023, versus EUR 15,657 million in 2022. In 2022, 92 Rafale were ordered (80 by the United Arab Emirates, 6 by Greece and 6 by Indonesia) compared to 18 Rafale ordered by Indonesia in 2023.\n\nThe **Defense France** share amounted to **EUR 2,941 million** in 2023, compared with EUR 1,853 million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the order for Batch 5 of 42 Rafale (in 2022, the order relating to Phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator was recorded).\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, **23 Falcon orders** were recorded, compared with 64 in 2022. Order intake totaled **EUR 1,729 million** versus EUR 3,444 million in 2022. This decrease is mainly due to the decline in the number of Falcon ordered (23 vs. 64 in 2022).\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.5. Adjusted net sales**\n\nNet sales for 2023 were **EUR 4,801 million** versus EUR 6,929 million in 2022. **Export** represented **68%**.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|                             | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Defense                     | 2,980 | 4,825 | 5,281 |\n| Defense Export              | 1,512 | 3,616 | 4,549 |\n| Defense France              | 1,468 | 1,209 | 732   |\n| Falcon                      | 1,821 | 2,104 | 1,952 |\n| Total adjusted net<br>sales | 4,801 | 6,929 | 7,233 |\n| % Export                    | 68%   | 82%   | 89%   |\n\n#### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **13 Rafale (11 France and 2 Export)** were delivered, compared with the guidance of 15. 14 Rafale (13 Export and 1 France) were delivered in 2022.\n\n**Defense net sales** in 2023 were **EUR 2,980 million** versus EUR 4,825 million in 2022. The **Defense Export share** was **EUR 1,512 million** versus EUR 3,616 million in 2022. This decrease is largely due to the delivery of 2 Export Rafale, whereas 13 Export Rafale were delivered in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense France** share was **EUR 1,468 million** versus EUR 1,209 million in 2022. Defense France 2023 net sales notably included the delivery of 11 Rafale versus 1 Rafale in 2022.\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\n**26 Falcon were delivered in 2023**, compared with the guidance of 35, versus 32 deliveries in 2022.\n\n**Falcon net sales** for 2023 were **EUR 1,821 million** versus EUR 2,104 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the number of Falcon aircraft delivered (26 vs. 32).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe book-to-bill ratio of the Group (order intake/net sales) is 1.72 for 2023.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.6. Backlog**\n\nThe consolidated backlog as of December 31, 2023 (determined in accordance with IFRS 15) was **EUR 38,508 million**, versus EUR 35,008 million as of December 31, 2022. Change in the backlog is as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n| As of December 31 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Defense           | 33,862 | 30,318 | 17,633 |\n| Defense Export    | 23,986 | 21,915 | 9,874  |\n| Defense France    | 9,876  | 8,403  | 7,759  |\n| Falcon            | 4,646  | 4,690  | 3,129  |\n| Total backlog     | 38,508 | 35,008 | 20,762 |\n| % Export          | 71%    | 72%    | 58%    |\n\nThe backlog as of December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\n\n- **Defense Export**: **EUR 23,986 million** versus EUR 21,915 million as of December 31, 2022. This figure notably includes 141 new Rafale in 2023, compared with 125 new Rafale and 6 pre-owned Rafale in the Defense Export backlog as of December 31, 2022,\n- **Defense France**: **EUR 9,876 million** versus EUR 8,403 million as of December 31, 2022. This figure mainly comprises 70 Rafale (vs. 39 at the end of December 2022), the support contracts for the Rafale (Ravel), Mirage 2000 (Balzac), ATL2 (Ocean) and the Alpha Jet (Alphacare), the Rafale F4 standard and the order for phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator.\n- **Falcon** (including the Albatros and Archange mission aircraft): **EUR 4,646 million** versus EUR 4,690 million as of December 31, 2022. It includes notably 84 Falcon, compared with 87 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAdditional information on the backlog can be found in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **1.1.7. Adjusted results**\n\n### **Adjusted operating income**\n\n**Adjusted operating income** for 2023 was **EUR 349 million**, compared with EUR 572 million in 2022.\n\nResearch and development costs totaled EUR 483 million in 2023 and accounted for 10.1% of net sales, compared with EUR 572 million and 8.3% of net sales in 2022. These amounts reflect the self-funded R&D effort focused on the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X programs.\n\nThe **adjusted operating margin** stood at **7.3%** compared to 8.3% in 2022, representing a 1.0 point decrease, notably due to the 1.8 point increase in the weight of research and development expenditure.\n\nThe foreign exchange hedging rate was USD 1.20/EUR in 2023, vs. USD 1.19/EUR in 2022.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Adjusted financial income**\n\n**2023 adjusted financial income** was EUR 210 million compared to EUR 11 million in 2022. This strong increase was due to financial income generated by the Group's cash position in a context of favorable interest rates.\n\n#### **Adjusted net income**\n\n**Adjusted net income** for 2023 was EUR **886 million** vs. EUR 830 million in 2022, increasing by 6.7 %. Thales' contribution to the Group's net income was EUR 453 million, versus EUR 386 million in 2022.\n\nAs a result, **adjusted net margin** was **18.5%** in 2023, versus 12.0% in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the higher net financial income and contribution from Thales.\n\nAdjusted net income per share in 2023 was **EUR 10.95** vs. EUR 9.99 in 2022.\n\n#### **1.1.8. Consolidated key figures under IFRS**\n\n**Consolidated operating income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated operating income** for 2023 was **EUR 349 million** vs. EUR 591 million in 2022.\n\nR&D costs totaled EUR 483 million in 2023 and accounted for 10.1% of consolidated net sales (EUR 4,805 million), compared to EUR 572 million and 8.2% of consolidated net sales in 2022. These amounts reflect the self-funded R&D effort focused on the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X programs.\n\nThe **consolidated operating margin** was **7.3%** compared to 8.5% in 2022.\n\n#### **Consolidated financial income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated net financial income** for 2023 was **EUR 212 million** vs. EUR -12 million in 2022. This strong increase was due to financial income generated by the Group's cash position in a context of favorable interest rates.\n\n#### **Consolidated net income (IFRS)**\n\n**Consolidated net income** for 2023 was **EUR 693 million,** compared with EUR 716 million in 2022. Thales' contribution to the Group's net income was EUR 259 million, versus EUR 275 million in 2022.\n\nAs a result, **consolidated net margin** was **14.4%** in 2023, as against 10.3% in 2022.\n\n**Consolidated net income per share** for 2023 was **EUR 8.57** compared with EUR 8.62 in 2022.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.1.9. Value Sharing**\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend distribution, in 2024, of EUR 3.37 per share, **EUR 266 million in aggregate**, representing a payout of 30%. The Board of Directors of March 5th, 2024, has decided to cancel 1,850,554 shares. The dividend per share is calculated based on the number of shares as of December 31, 2023, netted of the number of those shares canceled.\n\nFor 2023, the Group will pay **EUR 170 million** in employee profit-sharing and incentives, including 20% employer's corresponding tax, whereas the application of the legal formula would have resulted in a EUR 8 million payment (including the employer's corresponding tax).\n\nDividends per share over the five last years are provided in Note 32 to the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\n### **1.1.10. Financial reporting**\n\nIFRS 8 \"Operating Segments\" requires the presentation of information per segment according to internal management criteria.\n\nThe entire activity of the Dassault Aviation Group relates to the aerospace domain. Internal reporting to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and to the Chief Operating Officer, used for strategy and decision-making, does not include a performance analysis under IFRS 8 at a lower level then this sector.\n\n### **1.2. Financial structure**\n\n### **1.2.1. Available cash**\n\nThe Group uses a specific indicator called \"Available cash\", which reflects the amount of total cash available to the Group, net of financial debts. It includes the following balance sheet items: cash and cash equivalents, current financial assets and financial debt, excluding lease liabilities. The calculation of this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 9 of the December 31, 2023, consolidated financial statements).\n\n**The Group's available cash** stands at **EUR 7,294 million**, versus EUR 9,529 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in available cash in 2023 was mainly due to the increase in work-in-progress (execution of military contracts, ramp-up of the Falcon 6X), share buybacks and acquisition of the additional stake in Thales.\n\n#### **1.2.2. Consolidated balance sheet**\n\nTotal equity stood at EUR 5,742 million as of December 31, 2023 compared with EUR 6,006 million as of December 31, 2022. This amount has been impacted by the share buyback.\n\nBorrowings and financial debt stood at EUR 262 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR 234 million as of December 31, 2022. Borrowings and financial debt include locked-in employees' profitsharing funds, for EUR 78 million, and lease liabilities, for EUR 184 million.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nInventories and work-in-progress rose to EUR 5,258 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR 3,922 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase was due to the execution of military contracts and the ramp-up of the Falcon 6X.\n\nAdvances and progress payments received on orders, net of advances and progress payments paid decreased by EUR 137 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease relating to the retrocession of Rafale Export downpayments received at the end of 2022 to our co-contractors was almost entirely offset by advances received, notably for the Rafale contracts in Indonesia and Egypt.\n\nDerivative financial instruments had a market value of EUR 29 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with EUR -88 million as of December 31, 2022, reflecting an improvement in the hedging portfolio rate.\n\n### **1.3.

Deliveries are planned for between 2027 and 2032,\n- the delivery of 11 Rafale to France;\n- continued implementation of the development contract for the F4 standard, and notification of additional capacity for the F4-3 standard,\n\nIn Export, the highlight for 2023 was the commercial success of the Rafale, including:\n\n- the entry into force of an order of 18 aircraft for Indonesia on August 10, 2023, i.e. 24 Rafale for Indonesia in backlog as of December 31, 2023. Moreover, post-closing of the 2023 financial statements, an additional 18 Rafale entered into force on January 8, 2024 (they are therefore not included in the 2023 order intake, nor in the backlog as of December 31, 2023), taking the total ordered by Indonesia to 42 Rafale,\n- the choice of the Rafale Marine by the Indian government, which announced in July 2023 that it had selected the aircraft to equip the Indian Navy with 26 Rafale,\n- continuing prospection.\n\nMoreover, the Group continued to fulfill its export contract, with notably:\n\n- the delivery to Greece of 2 new Rafale and 6 pre-owned Rafale,\n- support for the delivery by France to Croatia of the first 4 pre-owned Rafale.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Mirage 2000\n\nThe highlight for 2023 was the acceptance by the United Arab Emirates of the SAD95 standard for the M2000-9.\n\n#### Future Combat Air System (FCAS)\n\nThe FCAS consists of creating a combat system built around a New Generation Fighter (NGF) combining piloted platforms (current and future generation fighters, tankers, AWACS) and drones. France has been designated lead nation on the project and Dassault Aviation lead contractor on the NGF.\n\nDassault Aviation is lead architect of pillar 1, the NGF, and is involved (as co-contractor or subcontractor) in pillars 3, 4, 5 and 7, as well as in item 0 (continuation of joint concept studies with the military and preparation of the operating system).\n\nDetailed specification for the development of the demonstrator, corresponding to Phase 1B of the contract awarded at the end of 2022, began in March 2023. A physical workspace was created in Saint-Cloud to welcome industrial teams from the three partner countries.\n\nFor the New Generation Fighter, the decision to move to phase 2 should be taken in line with a contracting in 2026 for a 1st flight of the demonstrator in 2029.\n\n### Eurodrone (Medium Altitude Long-Endurance drone)\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Airbus and the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) signed the Eurodrone contract relative to the development, the production and the 5-year maintenance of 20 systems.\n\nAirbus Defence and Space GmbH signed the contract as prime contractor, on behalf of the three main contractors, Airbus Defence and Space SAU in Spain, Dassault Aviation in France and Leonardo SpA in Italy.\n\nOCCAR represents the first four countries to order: Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nDassault Aviation is specifically in charge of flight control and mission communication systems. Work is continuing.\n\n### Multi-mission aircraft\n\nFor the multi-mission aircraft, the following key events took place in 2023.\n\n- Albatros: continued development of the \"AVSIMAR\" (maritime surveillance and response aircraft) on a Falcon 2000LXS platform (for the record: 7 aircraft ordered, with an option for a further 5),\n- Archange: continued development of the strategic intelligence aircraft based on a Falcon 8X platform (for the record: 2 aircraft ordered, with an option for 1 more),\n- ATL2: the 7th modernized aircraft has been delivered to the French Defense Procurement Agency (the last aircraft modernized by Dassault Aviation),\n- Future maritime patrol aircraft (PATMAR): launch of the architectural design based on the Falcon 10X (in competition with Airbus).\n\nIn Export, the highlight for 2023 was the delivery of 2 of the 4 \"green\" Falcon 2000 ordered by South Korea in 2022.\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, 23 orders were recorded and 26 Falcon delivered, compared with a guidance of 35, versus 64 orders and 32 deliveries in 2022.\n\nAfter being certified on August 22, 2023, the Falcon 6X including the application of post-certification improvements approved by the EASA entered into service on November 30, 2023.\n\nAn inflationary context, fears of a recession and banking crises weighed on demand for business jets.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness aviation traffic in the high-end segment remained stable in 2023 compared with 2022. The market for pre-owned aircraft was strong, although pre-owned aircraft inventories for sale increased to the same level as 2020.\n\nWe are continuing to enhance the Falcon range with the entry into service in November 2023 of the Falcon 6X and the continued development of the Falcon 10X. The Group is also improving its aircraft in service with the new EASy IV avionics proposed for the Falcon 7X/8X (13 upgrades made in 2023) and the Falcon Privacy Suite module proposed for the Falcon 8X (and for the Falcon 6X and Falcon 10X).\n\n#### Falcon 6X\n\nThe Falcon 6X program was certified on August 22, 2023 and the aircraft entered into service on November 30, 2023. The first customer delivery was on February 2024. Moreover:\n\n- The industrial ramp-up comes at a time of supply chain difficulties,\n- Customer feedback confirm a very high level of passenger comfort (acoustics, lighting, stability in flight and during descent),\n- Performances at low speeds (take-off and landing distances) are better than expected,\n- The cabin has received several awards for its design (including the Red Dot Award and the International Yacht and Aviation Award for Interior Design).\n\n### Falcon 10X\n\nDevelopment continues and we have now entered the industrialization and production phase.\n\n- The definition of the detailed technical specifications has been completed and production of the first development aircraft is underway.\n- This brand new aircraft is characterized by its long range (7,500 nm, for example New York to Shanghai, Los Angeles to Sydney, or Paris to Santiago de Chile) and the size of its cabin, which is the most spacious on the market, while maintaining the operational capabilities of the Falcon family. It will offer unequaled cabin modularity in its category,\n- It is fitted with two Rolls Royce Pearl 10X 100% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)-compatible engines, will have a top speed of 0.925 Mach and will be able to land and take off on short runways, such as London City Airport,\n- It features innovations and technologies, some of which are borrowed from our military aircraft (smart throttle controlling the two engines, recovery mode, composite wingbox, dual head-up display for primary flight data, etc.) and a state-of-the-art cockpit,\n- The program timeline has been adjusted,\n- The first deliveries are scheduled for 2027.\n\n### Business aviation and European Taxonomy for Transport\n\nBusiness aviation has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050; the segment currently generates 2% of global aviation CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, i.e. 0.04% of global CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. As a reminder, one year of global 2,100 Falcon fleet utilization is equivalent to 24 hours of global video streaming, 5 hours of worldwide truck traffic or 2.5 days of the German thermal power plants.\n\nBusiness aviation is excluded from \"green\" taxonomy, unlike commercial aviation. This exclusion is regrettable at a time when business aviation is a pioneer in decarbonization, notably thanks to its use of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and the optimization of missions. Supply chain SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises will be the first to suffer as this exclusion means that their access to financing will be more limited while they are already facing several difficulties.\n\nConsidering this exclusion being unjustified and not in accordance with European Union law, Dassault Aviation lodged on February 14th, 2024 an action for annulment with the General Court of the\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nEuropean Union, calling for the annulment of this provision and for the European commission to define criteria for the inclusion of business aviation in the taxonomy.\n\nAt the same time, the United States has launched an investment plan of more than USD 390 billion for clean energy and notably for SAF. Europe has a different approach, putting less funding on the table and imposing standards. The European approach continues to favor taxation and exclusion over incentives.\n\n### Four cornerstones to decarbonize business aviation\n\nDassault Aviation is active in the four main areas which will facilitate the decarbonization of the business aviation sector:\n\n- SAF: all Falcon models are certified to fly with SAF/kerosene blends of up to 50%. Current alternative fuels (SAF) reduce carbon emissions by between 80 and 90% compared to kerosene. All Dassault Aviation flights, including in the United States, operate using 30% SAF mixes, the only ones currently available on the market. In 2023, Dassault Aviation operated 413 flights using 30% SAF mixes (vs. 179 in 2022). Aircraft in production will be 100% SAF compatible in 2030 (natively for the Falcon 10X).\n- Research and Technology:\n\t- o the developments of the new programs (Falcon 6X, Falcon 10X) and those added to the existing Falcon family aim to improve the aerodynamics of these aircraft, optimize mass and increase engine performance,\n\t- o Dassault Aviation takes part in research programs in France (CORAC) and internationally (Clean Aviation) in order to reduce fuel consumption by optimizing the aircraft design,\n- Optimization of air operations:\n\t- o existing Falcon tools and properties (flexibility, avionics and flight controls, FalconEye*,* etc.) are major assets for the future of air traffic management,\n\t- o Dassault Aviation has developed an innovative flight plan optimization tool, called \"FalconWays\" to reduce fuel consumption and CO<sup>2</sup> emissions and received the Aviation Week Laureate Award in November 2023,\n- CO<sup>2</sup> emission storage: the Group provides philanthropic support for forest renewal and biodiversity conservation. Dassault Aviation is a \"Major Patron\" of Maubuisson forest (Val d'Oise, Ile-de-France region) where a planting campaign was launched in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Groupe ADP and Dassault Aviation signed a five-year agreement to strengthen their decarbonization actions at Paris-Le Bourget airport (distribution and use of SAF, use of electric equipment for ground operations, use of geothermal power for airport buildings and hangars).\n\n### Make in India\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to step up activities transferred to India via Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) which, among others, produces sections T12 and T4 of the Falcon 2000.\n\nThe Group is also continuing to develop the Indian supply chain (primary parts, tools, pylons, tanks, etc.), by expanding its base of local partners and appointing new major sub-contractors. Major contracts were signed at the beginning of 2024:\n\n- DYNAMATIC for the T5 tank of the Falcon 6X and for the supply of primary parts,\n- AEROLLOY, a subsidiary of the PTC Group, for the development of a titanium foundry division.\n\nMoreover, Dassault Aviation is investing in the development of the Indian supply chain's human capital. In this regard, the \"Dassault Skill Academy\" (a vocational training program for aeronautical fitters and a prestigious higher education pathway) offers the \"Aeronautics Vocational Baccalaureate\" training program in the State of Mahārāshtra with a secondary program in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The engineering center in Pune is fully operational.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.5.2. Military support and Falcon support**\n\n### **Military support**\n\nThe dedication and organization of our teams throughout 2023 enabled us to meet the fleet availability commitments required by military customers in France and for Export.\n\nFor France and vertically integrated operational maintenance contracts for Rafale (RAVEL), ATL2 (OCEAN) and Mirage 2000 (Balzac), highlights included:\n\n- responses to the various government requests in relation to the war in Ukraine,\n- active participation with expected availability for High Intensity warfare exercises carried out by French forces involving the Rafale, Mirage 2000 and ATL2,\n- delivery of the first airframe inspection drones for the Rafale,\n- notification at the end of 2023 of additional means to equip the Rafale squadron at the Orange air base (France), including in particular the new version of the Mermoz test bench for electronic equipment testing,\n- the opening of one-stop logistic centers at the Luxeuil and Nancy Mirage 2000 air bases and the gradual reopening of electronic workshops in Nancy,\n- the presentation of the first \"EMAR certificates\" to French technicians and managers from the French Air and Space Force following their training at the Conversion Training Center in Mérignac (France), and monitoring of training resources made available within the French Air and Space Force (CFR-NG).\n\nMoreover, for the French Alpha Jet, negotiation of the Alpha Jet vertically integrated support contract resulted at the end of 2023 in the award of the Alpha Care contract for a period of five years.\n\nFor support for the use of fleets in service for Export customers, the main highlights included:\n\n- for Egypt, passing the milestone of 10,000 flying hours for the Rafale, logged by the Egyptian Air Force on February 28 in Berigat, and support work carried out for the execution of the contract for the additional Rafale,\n- for Qatar, renewal of our support contract for 2023 and preparation for 2024,\n- for India, renewal of the contracts of our Technical Assistant teams at the Ambala and Hasimara air bases,\n- for Greece, steadily increasing aviation activity following the delivery of aircraft throughout the year with a fleet of 6 new and 12 pre-owned Rafale at the end of 2023,\n- for Croatia, the deliveries of parts and customer support systems, the customer's first aircraft have been made available in Mérignac, the arrival of Croatian pilots and technicians during the second half of 2023 and the beginning of Rafale training at our Conversion Training Center,\n- for the United Arab Emirates, we launched our support products and services and held regular meetings with our customer to prepare installations in the country,\n- for Indonesia, launch of support products and services corresponding to the notification of batch 1 and 2 of the contract.\n\n### **Falcon support**\n\nIn terms of Falcon support, 2023 saw:\n\n the growth of the Group's network of maintenance centers, now made up of more than 60 sites across the world: including the opening in 2023 of a new ExecuJet maintenance center in Dubai (to replace the old center),\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n- the preparation for the entry into service of the Falcon 6X: adaptation of the global network of maintenance centers, supply of spare parts and tools, theory training for mechanics and crew with CAE and practical training at Dassault Aviation in Mérignac,\n- stabilization of the WorldWideSpares solution,\n- two 6C-checks (36 years) on the Falcon 900B from the ET 60 under the maintenance contract for the French government's Falcon fleet, notified in September 2022 for seven years; the Group was congratulated by the government on its first year of operations at the Villacoublay air base,\n- renewal of the Hellenic Air Force's Falcon 7X support contract.\n\n### **1.5.3. Research and development**\n\nIn 2023, most of our research and development was focused on the development of the Falcon 10X, the finalization of the development and certification of the Falcon 6X, as well as the development of the Rafale, particularly its future standards, and the NGF demonstrator.\n\nThe Group is also keen to improve existing products and pave the way for future products, continually striving to reduce environmental impacts while offering its customers increasing levels of service and efficiency with unparalleled safety.\n\nSince 2008, Dassault Aviation has been a member of CORAC (COnseil pour la Recherche Aéronautique Civile – the French Civil Aviation Research Council), under the aegis of which leading manufacturers have drafted plans as part of the \"France 2030\" investment plan, which replaces the \"France Relance\" recovery plan and are preparing the national road map for 2024-2029.\n\nDassault Aviation is also involved in the last years of the European \"Clean Sky 2\" project and now the \"Clean Aviation\" program. Dassault Aviation is coordinating a project on the technical principles of requirements and how to comply with the future regulations needed to certify disruptive aircraft with a view to decarbonizing air transport.\n\nWithin these European and national frameworks, teams are actively working on developing technologies to improve environmental performance. In addition, Dassault Aviation is committed to working with regional ecosystems.\n\nMore specifically, this research and innovation work includes technological development projects and concepts such as:\n\n- reducing the weight of primary structures with new materials and processes (new metal alloys, composites),\n- reducing the weight of certain equipment and additional components (metal additive manufacturing, thermoplastics),\n- maturing electric de-icing technologies,\n- exploring how the flight controls can control a wing which is more elongated and therefore more efficient, but also more flexible and more prone to flutter,\n- the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), which must be compatible with fuel systems and engines when blended with conventional kerosene at high percentage levels, with a view to achieving 100% SAF operation in the medium term by the middle of the decade,\n- optimized flight planning and management to reduce fuel consumption, and therefore CO<sup>2</sup> (an initial flight app has been launched under the commercial name FalconWays) and optimized take-off and landing trajectories to reduce external noise,\n- research into concepts and technologies for the reduction of noise at source, which must not increase aircraft mass and/or aerodynamic drag,\n- reduction of pilot workload as part of this optimization process, and development of protective features for piloting systems,\n- extension of the capacity of the synthetic vision system to increase the operational capacity of the Falcon in severe weather conditions,\n- optimization of the cabin air system to maximize passenger comfort and reduce health risks.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n Research into alternative solutions following the publication by Europe of its hazardous substances list (REACH)\n\nIn addition, the Group continues to make significant efforts to increase the efficiency, from the design stage, of its production processes and maintenance services by using the tools offered by digital technology:\n\n- co-engineering methods are tested and implemented to ensure the best trade-offs between design, production and support,\n- optimization of the entire testing process (new types of instrumentation, processing and data analysis) and hybridization of simulation models and test data reduce the number of development flight tests and the processing cycle for any adjustments,\n- advances in digital technology help demonstrate why the aircraft meets the certification criteria,\n- optimizing the production cycle involves research into eco-design, new materials, additive manufacturing and waste recycling, and finding alternative solutions for treating and protecting parts from corrosion, such as the removal of chromates and baths in the processes,\n- the development of algorithms for automated fleet data processing should increase predictive maintenance capabilities.\n\nThe Group has stepped up scientific and industrial collaboration on methods and tools for the development, validation, verification and qualification of reliable artificial intelligence (AI) functions, with the aim of improving system efficiency and productivity via adapted and secure AI processes that use sensitive information. In particular, the Group is exploring its contribution to improving the efficiency of future flight operations to take full advantage of the collaborative combat concept. The teams are working on proofs of concept with academics and innovative companies in the field.\n\nTo strike a balance between short-cycle innovations and technological developments over the long term, work is focused on architectures that can effectively integrate changes and disruptions, while meeting the highest safety requirements.\n\nWith the InnovLab process we are continuing our rapid-application proof of concept (feasibility) demonstrations. Several of them have been launched as part of the network-based innovation process that networks creative laboratory initiatives to foster their collaborative work. Particular attention is paid to relationships with a dynamic start-up ecosystem.\n\nWork is continuing at the MOLIERE joint research laboratory with two universities on innovative functional materials for aviation. Initial results are promising and additional support has been received from the AID (Agence d'Innovation de Défense – French Defense Innovation Agency) since early 2022.\n\n### **1.5.4. \"Leading Our Future\"**\n\n\"Leading Our Future\" is focused on preparing the Group's future in an increasingly unpredictable and competitive environment. The main objective is improving competitiveness and flexibility.\n\nTo do so, four areas for action have been introduced since 2017:\n\n- Human capital, organization, methods,\n- Production facilities and innovation,\n- Digital solutions to drive operational performance,\n- Program coordination.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Employee recruitment, training and guidance\n- The consolidation of our digital platforms:\n\t- o Widespread use of the 3DExpérienceTM platform for program coordination, extension of the design office, completion, technical collaboration with our suppliers and aggregation of technical data (for the industrial definition and operation of our aircraft),\n\t- o Single database for planning and managing purchasing, production and support flows through SAP,\n\t- o Big data: data processing to provide better support to our military and civil customers,\n\t- o Sovereign Cloud with the 3DExperienceTM Cloud solution as part of our aircraft maintenance programs and the European FCAS program,\n\t- o Data Act: protection of our intellectual property and securing cyber risks with the European Commission.\n- Modernisation of industrial infrastructure\n\t- o Istres: delivery of the building designed to house the Falcon 10X simulator,\n\t- o Mérignac: adaptation of building G for special projects and of building K to house the Falcon 10X,\n\t- o Martignas: delivery of the building for assembly of the Falcon 10X wingbox,\n\t- o Cergy: delivery of the building postponed to 2024.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue to work on the following catalysts for action:\n\n- Human capital, organization, methods, training and guidance,\n- Digital solutions to drive operational performance,\n- Programs and innovation,\n- Make in India.\n\n### **1.5.5. Total quality**\n\nThe objective of the Dassault Aviation's total quality is to ensure right from the start that the quality of our products and services fully meets the expectations of our customers.\n\nDelivering quality products and services also contributes to the safety and airworthiness of our aircraft.\n\nThe management of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and supervision of the Company's operations are also part of the total quality department's role.\n\nObjectives are shared with all Dassault Aviation employees. Achieving them is possible because people at the company embody the culture of quality, and because our efficient management and quality assurance system is universally applied.\n\nThanks to its integrated management system, Dassault Aviation holds the following certification:\n\n- ISO 9001, EN 9100 and AQAP 2110, for the development, production and maintenance of our products and services,\n- ISO 14001, for the environment.\n\nThe Group's organization has also allowed it to hold design, production and maintenance airworthiness certifications for its civil and military aircraft. These certifications, which were issued by the main airworthiness authorities, are a recognition of Dassault Aviation's ability to design, produce and maintain civil and military aircraft in compliance with the strictest airworthiness requirements.\n\nWeaknesses at some of our suppliers will continue to remain a focus in 2024. For this reason, we will continue our major efforts to monitor and support them. With particular attention paid to maintaining skills and mastering manufacturing processes.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main themes for the Total Quality policy in 2024 remain:\n\n- Maintaining Falcon and military customer satisfaction at the top of industry rankings to guarantee sustainable long-term sales,\n- Drawing on human capital to reinforce our expertise and our commitment to serving industrial performance,\n- Continuing to use data to be efficient in our quality assurance and continuous improvement plans,\n- Developing quality assurance at our suppliers to reinforce our \"right first time\" approach.\n\nThe main themes of the CSR policy in 2024 are:\n\n- Decarbonization, with the use of alternative fuel (SAF),\n- Application of our environmental sobriety plan to all our industrial and tertiary sites,\n- The new talent recruitment and support plan (same level of recruitment than in 2023).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2. RISK FACTORS**\n\nThis chapter describes the main risks to which the Dassault Aviation Group is exposed. Some of the risks listed are covered in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration (\"NFPD\") in Chapter 4 of this report.\n\nThe Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties which may affect its activities, reputation or ability to achieve its objectives.\n\nThese various factors are taken into account using a comprehensive risk management system in order to:\n\n- continually identify the sources of risk at the earliest possible opportunity so that the consequences can be better managed,\n- map the risks each year across all of the Group's functions, under the aegis of the Corporate Risk Committee.\n\nThe risks described are the most significant net risks, categorized by residual importance (high/medium/low) following measures to mitigate them. For each risk, its impact is combined with its probability of occurrence or its short/medium/long-term nature.\n\n| Exposure to risk | Identified Risk                                                   | Risk Category                            |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| High             | o Dependence on the supply chain                                  | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Program management                                              | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Cyber risks for IT systems                                      | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Security risks                                                  | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Global economic and geopolitical environment                    | Economic and Market risks                |\n| Medium           | o Markets                                                         | Economic and Market risks                |\n|                  | o Risks related to personnel                                      | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Environmental risks                                             | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Corporate social responsibility                                 | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Protection of intellectual property                             | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Market (exchange rate risk)                                     | Financial and market risks               |\n| Low              | o Implementation of Make In India                                 | Operational risks                        |\n|                  | o Compliance                                                      | Reputational, regulatory and legal risks |\n|                  | o Financial (liquidity and treasury; loans and<br>counterparties) | Financial and market risks               |\n|                  | o Inadequate coverage                                             | Insurance                                |\n\n### **Summary of material risks**\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2.1. Economic and market risks**\n\n### **2.1.1. Market risks**\n\nOn the civil market, the slowdown seen at the end of 2022 was confirmed in 2023, exacerbated by increased energy and credit costs, as well as by an international context marked by a combination of uncertainties.\n\nIn addition, some entities in the maintenance network in Europe were faced with the loss of Russian customers since 2022 and a stagnating fleet in this region. In the United States, the Group continued to develop its current operations against an extremely competitive backdrop.\n\nCompetitors continue to benefit from favorable economic factors and flexibility due to their location in the dollar zone.\n\nTo address this, Dassault Aviation is pursuing its efforts to innovate and expand its Falcon range, as well as streamline production and reduce costs.\n\nFurthermore, mindful of its customers' carbon footprint, the Group is fully engaged with the industry's commitments to the environmental transition, following the Paris Agreement on carbon neutrality by 2050. Dassault Aviation's strategy includes the use of sustainable alternative fuels, for which production and the distribution network are expanding. In the short term, it continues studies to optimize aircraft already in operation and to seek innovation solutions for its projects. For the medium term, Dassault Aviation takes into account the tightening of French and European environmental regulations relating to climate change (the measures taken are detailed in Section 4.7). This complex regulatory environment could potentially lead to risks of competitiveness and distortion of competition.\n\nIn the defense sector, the export situation is benefiting from the geopolitical context. The search for Rafale contracts remains an ongoing challenge and the launch of demonstrators remains essential for future programs.\n\n### **2.1.2. Risks related to the global economic and geopolitical environment**\n\nThe nature of the Group's business exposes it to risks related to the uncertainties and volatility of the global economy, as well as political instability.\n\nThe international context was once again shaped by war in Ukraine and more recently by the conflict in the Middle-East, as well as the accompanying geopolitical instability. Should this conflict spread to the Gulf, it could have significant consequences for political equilibrium in the Middle East, as well as for global growth and energy prices.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, supplies in the aviation sector remain under significant pressure.\n\nThe Group generates a significant part of its business from government customers, and particularly from defense contracts. Public spending on these types of contracts depends on political and economic factors, which are likely to influence opportunities.\n\nIn the field of business aviation, customers are sensitive to the global economic situation and their financing capacity may depend on it.\n\n### **2.2. Operational risks**\n\n### **2.2.1. Risks of dependence on the Supply Chain**\n\nThe contribution of suppliers makes up a significant part of Dassault Aviation's products. As a result, supplier performance (price, quality and lead time) contributes to the Group's performance, and the failure of a supplier could jeopardize its programs and deliveries.\n\nAs production depends on an adequate supply for the production lines, any instability or supplier default could lead to significant disruption, delays, or even production line shutdowns.\n\nIn 2023, the structural and financial consequences of the various crises were acutely felt by suppliers faced with the recovery of the sector and capacity saturation, leading to severe pressure on supplies. As this situation has an impact on the development and production of its aircraft, the Group strives to limit these negative impacts by monitoring its suppliers' production more closely.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeliveries in 2023 were adversely affected by supply chain disruptions. Supplier defaults, coupled with capacity shortages, mainly in aerostructure, resulted in delays in production start-ups.\n\nAdded to this were efforts to decarbonize and the increasing risk of cyber attacks. These factors notably weaken the supply chain.\n\nThere are different kinds of supplier risks:\n\n- structural risks (financial soundness or changes in equity ownership),\n- operational risks (technical failures, quality issues, supply disruptions, delivery delays, cyberattacks, etc.),\n- compliance risks (legal, regulatory, etc.) and export bans,\n- global risks (geopolitical, natural disasters, pandemics, etc.).\n\nFaced with these risks, the Group has set up a \"Watch Tower\" for its suppliers to improve monitoring and Supplier Risk Committees to assess appropriate preventative and corrective measures, to meet the needs of the production chains.\n\nThe risk to our supplies and production management is still present in 2024. We have adapted our organization and implemented a centralized steering plan to introduce corrective measures, provide the necessary support to certain sub-contractors and develop \"Make in India.*\"*\n\n### **2.2.2. Risks related to program management**\n\nThe timescales required for the development and production of the Group's products, the complexity of aviation technology, flight safety requirements and the existence of long-term contractual obligations expose the programs to risks that it is essential to manage in order to meet schedules and customer commitments and thus protect net sales.\n\nAs an industrial architect and integrator, Dassault Aviation must manage a multitude of partners and suppliers while observing technical, legal and financial constraints, particularly in relation to contracts involving transfers of technology.\n\nR&D investments, technical and technological choices, and program innovations must satisfy customers' long-term operational needs and expectations, while integrating the requirements of increasingly stringent environmental emission standards for civil aircraft (noise, NOx, CO2, etc.).\n\nTo adapt to the market environment, Dassault Aviation needs to have flexible and responsive production lines, including within its supply chain, to ensure that the potential is in line with production commitments and be able to cater to customer demand.\n\n### **2.2.3. Cyber risks for IT systems**\n\nSince 2020, the cyber exposure of companies has increased and the risk of attacks has become much greater for the Group and its supply chain in particular.\n\nSince any IT system failure can result in data loss and business disruption, the Group has procedures in place and has taken steps to protect itself against the risk of its IT systems being attacked.\n\nBecause the human factor is a major issue in cybersecurity, regular efforts are made to raise awareness and remind employees and partners of the need for vigilance.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe surveillance and protection systems are continually being adapted at Group level in response to the changing threat. Communications infrastructure and systems have evolved in view of the need to work and interact online within a secure environment. The safeguards put in place and the architecture adopted by the Group have protected it from the main threats.\n\nThe recovery plan in the event of system shutdown is tested annually to ensure the continuity of operations.\n\nEffective IT protection also requires all sub-contractors in the supply chain to have robust systems as well as the implementation of an appropriate standard*.* In addition, an agreement was signed at the end of 2019 between the French Ministry of Armed Forces and the defense industry, calling on the latter to supply the armed forces with equipment that is more resistant to cyberattack.\n\nThe Group has also factored in the changing threat to onboard systems, the services offered to our customers, and our production facilities.\n\n### **2.2.4. Security risks**\n\nThe international context has led to an increase in the alert level both in France and abroad. At the end of 2023, the Company increased its level of vigilance with regard the threat of destabilization from various sources following the resurgence of tensions in the Middle East. This level of vigilance will remain the same in 2024 as, in the current geostrategic context, damage to the Group's reputation, industrial operations and the use of its fighter jets could seek to undermine national military sovereignty.\n\nThe Group's personnel and its industrial, technical and scientific assets are safeguarded by systematic site access control procedures, physical protection systems, operational assessment of suppliers and a \"security\" step in the recruitment process. The blurring of private and work lives caused by the organizational changes put in place since 2020 has prompted greater awareness about the importance of protective measures.\n\nThe security risk is also addressed by protecting the IT systems. The gradual introduction of remote working has significantly increased exposure to the risk of industrial espionage, particularly through attempts to steal data by phishing or other Trojan horses.\n\nEmployees are made aware of the cyber risk and radicalization in the workplace, as well as procedures to remind \"travelers\" of the precautions necessary for a safe trip.\n\n### **2.2.5. Risks related to personnel**\n\n#### **Risks related to the Group's attractiveness and the development and retention of talent (see NFPD)**\n\nThe Group's performance is highly dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and grow the talent necessary to manage and develop programs. The loss of technical skills is a risk as they are the Group's main asset and guarantee the quality expected by its customers.\n\nThe competitive environment requires the adaptation and continuous improvement of the organizational structure.\n\nDassault Aviation significantly increased the number of recruitments in 2022 to ramp-up production and renew its skill sets. To promote talent integration, retention and development, the Group introduced several support and training measures aimed at its employees.\n\nIn terms of occupational health and safety (see. NFPD), the Group's activities can give rise to various situations in which the health and safety of its staff could be at risk. A systematic policy of reducing occupational risks and improving working conditions has been in place for several years. The measures taken are described in Section 4.6.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2.2.6. Environmental risks**\n\nThe Group complies with the national and international regulations applicable in the countries in which it operates, as well as standards relating to the environmental performance of its products and activities.\n\n### **Risks of pollution or damage to the environment**\n\nIn terms of environmental risk control, the Environmental Management System (EMS) includes a risk analysis deployed in the Company's facilities and in its major subsidiaries.\n\nNo court has ever found the Group guilty of pollution or ordered it to pay compensation to repair damage caused to the environment. In 2023, the Group did not have to recognize any environmental liabilities.\n\nThe preventive measures taken are described in §4.7.\n\nRegarding the environmental risk of classified installations, the Company is only required to provide financial security for one of its facilities (Decree No. 2012-633 of May 3, 2012).\n\n#### **Risks related to the consequences of climate change (see NFPD)**\n\nDue to its geographical location, the Group has low exposure to the physical consequences of climate change, whether for its industrial sites or supply chain, which are mainly European and North American. The Group's only facility exposed to the risk of tornadoes, in Little Rock, Arkansas, has put in place a business continuity plan.\n\nThe fight against climate change is one of the European and national strategic ambitions, with a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and ambitious intermediate targets in 2030 and 2040. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted those targets in environmental standards incorporated into our product design requirements. This allows the Group to mitigate the transition risk associated with climate change.\n\nThe measures taken are described in Section 4.7.\n\n#### **2.2.7. Risks related to the implementation of Make In India**\n\nThe Group launched Make in India in view of the offset obligations linked to India's contract for the purchase of 36 Rafale. The Nagpur plant delivers fuselage sections for the Falcon 2000 and Rafale parts.\n\nThe growth of the business also depends on the local supply chain being extended to new suppliers.\n\n### **2.3. Reputational, regulatory and legal risks**\n\n#### **2.3.1. Corporate social responsibility**\n\nThe Group may be exposed to potential risks resulting from its products, activities or practices. To protect itself from risks that could have a lasting impact on its image, the Group has put in place organizational measures and CSR governance, as well as tools consistent with the risks identified. It has also established various operating procedures and issued guidance on best practice. These provisions underline Dassault Aviation's commitment to environmental, social, societal and governance issues.\n\nMost of these risks are regulated, and some are included in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration (\"NFPD\") in Chapter 4 of this report.\n\n#### **2.3.2. Compliance**\n\nThe nature of the Group's business means that it is subject to an extremely diverse and continually changing legal and regulatory framework with increasingly stringent requirements:\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n- in terms of product airworthiness, with aircraft program developments being regulated at the national, European and international level,\n- in terms of employees (see §4.5) and the protection of personal data,\n- in terms of the environment and occupational health and safety (see §4.6) and the Duty of Care,\n- In terms of the application of the anti-corruption mechanism (Loi Sapin 2, FCPA, etc.),\n- in terms of customs, economic, ethics, tax and financial regulations.\n\nThese regulations, at times extra-territorial in nature (particularly from the United States), create additional constraints and uncertainties (embargoes, restrictive financial and/or commercial measures, ITAR, ethics, etc.).\n\nThis complex regulatory environment has the potential to cause compliance risks and risks of obsolescence (particularly among certain suppliers and sub-contractors, with the associated costs and lead times), competitiveness or distortion of competition.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Group has established a compliance program to ensure strict compliance with laws and regulations, as well as a dedicated department - the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\n#### **2.3.3. Protection of intellectual property**\n\nInnovation has become an essential tool to guarantee the success of the Company's products.\n\nThe protection of the Company's intellectual property and know-how, principally via secrecy, patents, copyright and trademarks, is a major challenge in the protection of its assets. In particular, the Company uses intellectual property rights to protect its technology, to prevent competitors from using that protected technology, and to remain competitive. Regarding the FCAS/NGF contract, the Company has sought to guard against the risk of technology leakage.\n\nThe Company has always focused on protecting its innovations and its know-how through confidentiality. Employees are encouraged to take the necessary measures to avoid any inadvertent disclosure. Some of our innovations remain secret and evidence of their creation is produced, if necessary. Other innovations are patented, particularly in the context of the Company's civil and military programs.\n\nThe Company's portfolio of patents continues to grow. It comprises French or foreign patents filed in strategic countries. Trademarks are also filed regularly to protect the names of the Company's leading products and services in the countries where it operates. Awareness-raising sessions focusing on intellectual property and confidentiality are organized for the employees concerned to ensure they are able to actively protect technological assets.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to create inventions through a pay policy that has been tailored accordingly. An \"Intellectual Property Committee\" meets regularly to decide on the necessary protections for the Company's strategic inventions.\n\n### **2.4. Financial and market risks**\n\n### **2.4.1. Financial risks**\n\n#### **Cash and liquidity risks**\n\nThe Group investment portfolio is primarily composed of time deposit, debt securities and others securities with no significant risk of impairment.\n\nTreasury and investment portfolio allow the Group to face its commitments without liquidity risk.\n\n#### **Credit and counterparty risks**\n\nThe Group performs its cash and foreign exchange transactions with recognized financial institutions. It divides its investments and bank accounts among the various selected institutions.\n\nThe Group limits counterparty risk by conducting most of its sales in cash and ensuring that the loans granted to a limited number of customers are secured by export insurance guarantees (Bpifrance \n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nAssurance Export) or collateral. The manufacturing risk is also guaranteed with Bpifrance Assurance Export for major military export contracts.\n\nAdditional information is available in Notes 8 \"Trade and other receivables\" and 23.2 \"Management of credit and counterparty risks\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **2.4.2. Market risks**\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risks**\n\nThe Group is exposed to a foreign exchange risk through the Parent Company's Falcon sales, which are virtually all denominated in US dollars. The Parent Company's foreign exchange risk is partly hedged by its purchases in dollars, and partly by the use of forward exchange contracts and options(1). This risk is permanent, taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. This is a significant risk for the Group, since the measures put in place to limit this risk are not sufficient to make the net risk zero (periods not covered by hedges, possible financial impact of hedges already taken in the event of reversal of market assumptions).\n\n(1) A sensitivity analysis of the hedge portfolio can be found in Note 23.3 \"Management of market risks.\" For the sale of Dassault Aviation's military aircraft, movements in the dollar exchange rate can affect its competitiveness, as comparisons with competitors are made in this currency.\n\n### **2.5. Insurance**\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department implements the risk transfer policy of Dassault Aviation defined by the Executive Management.\n\nCoverage of all the risks generated by the aeronautical activities of Dassault Aviation and its subsidiaries (work-in-progress, changing aircraft, civil liability after delivery, maintenance and logistical support, etc.) constitutes the largest item of the insurance budget.\n\nCoverage is obtained from a broad panel of insurers and reinsurers that specialize in the aviation industry and offer high solvency margins to ensure they are able to handle any long-term claims.\n\nThe Group's sites, as well as its industrial facilities, are insured for fire and other risks.\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department oversees a regular audit program of the Group's sites. It disseminates the risk prevention and industrial facilities protection policy to reduce the frequency and intensity of accidental risks. To do this, it relies on the specialized engineers of the property damage insurer.\n\nOther programs are purchased in order to reduce risks not related to aviation activity: general civil liability, environmental damage, the fleet of vehicles, construction sites including assembly and testing and the civil liability of corporate officers and directors.\n\nThe Legal Affairs and Insurance Department ensures that the Group's insurance coverage constantly adapts to changes in its structure and business.\n\nDassault Assurances Courtage and Agence Aéronautique d'Assurances are involved in the placement of risks. Dassault-Réassurance handles the subscription of reinsurance portions for the Group's aviation and fire risks.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3. INTERNAL AUDITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES**\n\n### **3.1. Internal auditing objectives**\n\nThe purpose of the internal auditing procedures set up in our Company is to:\n\n- ensure that the conducting of operations and management actions, and the behavior of staff fall within the framework defined by Executive Management, applicable laws and regulations, and our Company's internal values and rules,\n- verify that the information provided and communications addressed to the Board of Directors and to the General Meetings are reliable and give a true and fair view of the Company's activity.\n\nOne of the main purposes of the internal auditing system is to anticipate and control the risks resulting from the Company's activity and risks of error or fraud, particularly with respect to finance and accounting. However, as with any control system, it cannot provide absolute assurance that these risks have been totally eliminated.\n\n### **3.2. Environment and general organization of internal auditing**\n\n### **3.2.1. Internal auditing reference documents**\n\nThe Company's internal auditing is guided by the following reference documents:\n\n- the Quality Manual, which describes the Company processes,\n- the Organization Manual, which describes the tasks and organization of each department,\n- the economic and financial data management procedure described in the Quality Manual for accounting and financial activities,\n- an Anticorruption Code and an Internal Alert Procedure complete the processes that already exist,\n- a Supplier Vigilance Plan.\n\nDassault Aviation also draws on the AMF reference framework of July 22, 2010. Internal control activities are performed by each and every department.\n\n### **3.2.2. Control of subsidiaries**\n\nThe Parent Company maintains an effective presence on the Boards of Directors and management bodies of its subsidiaries.\n\nPeriodic directors' reports are prepared by each subsidiary for the Parent Company.\n\n### **3.2.3. Internal auditing**\n\nAttached to the Total Quality Management Department, the Internal Audit and Risk Department is tasked with assessing risk management and internal auditing processes.\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risk Director reports to Executive Management on the results of the audits and the recommendations implemented. The Internal Audit Director also presents the Internal Audit plan to Executive Management for approval prior to its implementation.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the Internal Audit and Risk Director and examines the Group's major risks, the audit plan and the findings of the audits.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.2.4. External auditing factors**\n\nThe Company operates in a particular external auditing environment due to its French government contracts and aviation activity:\n\n- the calculation of our cost price components (hourly rates, procurement and non-production expenses) as well as the cost prices of our activities related to French government contracts are examined by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA),\n- in the field of military aviation, product monitoring, our acknowledgment of design skills and our acknowledgment of skill in the production of Rafale for Export is overseen by the DGA,\n- the Company, in the field of civil aviation, possesses design, production and maintenance certifications. These certifications are subject to ongoing monitoring by the airworthiness authorities that have issued them:\n\t- o the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC),\n\t- o the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA),\n\t- o the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),\n\t- o Other foreign authorities depending on the market.\n\nThe Parent Company and its subsidiaries DFJ and DFS are EN 9100-, ISO 9001- and ISO 14001 certified. Audits conducted in 2023 by outside organizations confirmed the compliance of our management systems with the requirements of the standards.\n\n### **3.3. Risk management procedures**\n\nThe risk management organization detailed in Chapter 2 of this report is based on a risk mapping updated by each of the Company's major departments and primary subsidiaries of the Group for the activities that concern them.\n\nEach of the risks identified in this mapping, whatever its nature, has been assessed according to its seriousness and its frequency of occurrence. The procedures for handling risks are also recorded in this mapping.\n\nThe risk management procedures are defined and applied by the departments of the Company.\n\nIn particular, Program risk control at Dassault Aviation is performed through regular risk reviews organized by the Program Departments with the Operational Departments.\n\nRisks are monitored at the various stages in a product's life cycle for various reviews. The purpose of these reviews is to identify new risks and monitor and reduce existing risks.\n\nThe Total Quality Management Department, through the Internal Audit and Risk Department, notifies Executive Management of risks by transmitting the list of most critical risks identified.\n\nFinally, the Risk Committee's mission, based on risk mapping and a campaign of interviews with all Departments, is to:\n\n- validate the identified risks, their classification and the risk reduction actions carried out,\n- ensure that new risks are identified, taken into account and their financial impacts measured.\n\nTo this end, the Committee conducts interviews with senior directors of the Company who are responsible for updating the risk map.\n\nThe Committee also ensures that the risk management system is taken into account in its subsidiaries. It is chaired by the Senior Executive Vice President, Total Quality, assisted by the Director of Internal Audit and Risks, secretary of the Committee, and reports to the Executive Management.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.4. Internal auditing procedures for financial and accounting purposes**\n\n### **3.4.1. Organization of the financial and accounting function**\n\nThis function, described in the Quality Manual, is managed by the Finance Department for both the Parent Company and Group consolidation. This aforesaid function consists of:\n\n- validating and auditing the Company's financial and accounting information system, implemented by Information Systems General Management,\n- updating the consolidation software configuration used by the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n### **3.4.2. General references**\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with:\n\n- the accounting standards applicable to French companies:\n\t- o Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) Regulation 2014-03,\n\t- o subsequent opinions and recommendations of the ANC.\n- the international standards for the measurement and presentation of IFRS financial information in force as of December 31, 2023, as adopted by the European Union, which must be applied for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, for the consolidated financial statements,\n- the operating and control procedures described in the economic and financial data management procedure, supplemented by the special procedures for the preparation of company and half-yearly financial statements of the Parent Company and the Consolidated Group. These procedures and the IT applications used by the finance and accounting department are regularly reviewed by the Statutory Auditors in connection with their annual certification of the financial statements.\n\n### **3.4.3. Financial and accounting information process**\n\nIn 2023, the Finance Department centralized the accounting data and produced the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group.\n\nIt distributed a schedule of the tasks and controls to be performed at each period-end to the relevant persons in the Parent Company and subsidiaries. This schedule indicated the start date for the Statutory Auditors' certification procedures at approximately six weeks prior to the Board meeting at which the financial statements are submitted for approval.\n\nIn parallel, the reports and financial statements are checked by a review committee, independent of the teams participating in the drafting of these documents.\n\n### **3.5. 2023 actions**\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risks Department and the Total Quality Management Department continued to monitor the internal audit procedures for all parties involved by using the risk mapping that was updated during the year.\n\nThey performed the audits in order to verify the proper application of the internal auditing procedures.\n\n### **3.6. 2024 action plan**\n\nFor 2024, the Total Quality Management Department and the Internal Audit Department are tasked with continuing the audits that ensure oversight of internal controls and risk management, and the proper application of procedures.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4. NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION (\"NFPD\")**\n\n### **4.1. General Policy and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**\n\nSince joining the United Nations Global Compact in 2003, Dassault Aviation has committed itself to an active Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy. This policy, which has been enhanced over time, demonstrates the Group's commitment to its employees, environment and suppliers.\n\nBuilt on current CSR issues and backed by industry standards and rules, Dassault Aviation's CSR policy is built on five pillars.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/7 description: The image is a circular diagram divided into five colored sections, each representing a different aspect of corporate responsibility. In the center of the circle is the acronym \"RSE\". The sections are as follows: Green: \"Improve environmental performance of our activities and products\" with bullet points including reinforcing the low carbon Company plan, integrating eco-design, and reducing environmental footprint. Yellow: \"Be part of a responsible approach\" with bullet points including preventing corruption risks, reinforcing responsible purchasing, and keeping industrial risks to the lowest level. Blue: \"Propose an attractive and motivating social model\" with bullet points including attracting and retaining talent, promoting diversity and equal opportunity, and proposing attractive compensation and benefits. Red: \"Guarantee a high quality, healthy and secure workplace\" with bullet points including bringing the Company up to an effective prevention culture, continuing to reduce occupational risk, and developing the quality of life at work. Orange: \"Meet regulatory requirements and compliance obligations\" with bullet points including complying with international, national and local regulations, acting in accordance with commitments and charters, and listening to Company's stakeholders.\n\nWith this approach, Dassault Aviation is putting the social, environmental, and societal aspects of its business first.\n\nThe commitments thus made at the Group level reflect the sustainable development challenges adopted by the UN in 2015. The actions taken in this respect mostly contribute to 8 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Contribution of the Dassault Aviation Group to the Sustainable Development Goals**\n\nImage /page/91/Figure/3 description: The image is a circular diagram outlining Dassault Aviation's commitment to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The diagram is divided into 17 sections, each representing a different SDG. The SDGs are arranged in a circle around the Dassault Aviation logo. Each SDG is represented by its corresponding icon and a brief description. The SDGs are as follows: 1. No Poverty, 2. Zero Hunger, 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 5. Gender Equality, 6. Clean Water and Sanitation, 7. Affordable and Clean Energy, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production, 13. Climate Action, 14. Life Below Water, 15. Life on Land, 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, 17. Partnerships for the Goals. The image also includes text descriptions of Dassault Aviation's commitment to each SDG. The text descriptions are located around the outside of the circle.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.2. CSR organization**\n\nA Group CSR manager, appointed by Dassault Aviation's CEO, is responsible for defining a CSR policy based on the main issues and risks identified and for overseeing its application.\n\nThis manager and his or her team within the Total Quality Management Department relies on a network of CSR officers assigned to each department of the Parent Company and each Group subsidiary.\n\n### **4.3. Listening to the Company's stakeholders and meeting their expectations**\n\nListening to external and internal stakeholders and meeting their expectations is of fundamental importance for Dassault Aviation.\n\nOne of our chief concerns is listening to our customers; trade shows and customer days are an opportunity to do precisely that.\n\nEvents are also held regularly with our shareholders and suppliers.\n\nWe are actively involved in aviation industry bodies both in France (GIFAS, UIMM, AFEP, AFNOR, etc.) and internationally (ICAO, GAMA, EBAA, ASD, IAEG, IAQG, etc.).\n\nWe also maintain close ties with the academic community and with students in aeronautical disciplines through the various initiatives carried out (see Section 4.5.1 \"Attracting and retaining talent\").\n\nListening to our internal stakeholders is equally important. It is facilitated by meetings of the central or local Economic and Social Committee (CSE), of the central or local Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CSSCT), commissions and thematic committees (economic, training, employment/gender equality surveys, disability, etc.), or at various annual events.\n\nThe special relationships we forge with our stakeholders enable us to identify their expectations and factor them into our products, services and CSR policy.\n\n### **4.4. Identification of non-financial risks**\n\nTo identify and prioritize non-financial issues and risks, which are the building blocks of the CSR policy, the Parent Company performs a materiality assessment assisted by the network of CSR officers. The assessment includes:\n\n- mapping of the main Company risks (see Section 2 Risk factors),\n- CSR issues identified for aerospace companies by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB),\n- a summary of CSR issues identified in a panel of comparable national and international companies in terms of activity,\n- a non-financial risk assessment that takes into account the impact of issues for both Dassault Aviation and its stakeholders.\n\nThe materiality assessment was updated in 2023 based on new requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This updated version will be used to draft the next version of the CSR policy and its implementation through new action plans.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing this identification, the following issues and risks were selected in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration:\n\n| Challenges                                                     | Risk factors<br>(risk exposure)                                   | Policies                                                 | 2023 key performance<br>indicators<br>(reference 2019)                                                                                                                                                                                           | Sustainable<br>Development<br>Goals (SDGs)<br>affected |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attractiveness,<br>employment and<br>skills                    | Section<br>2.2 Risks<br>related to personnel<br>(moderate)        | Section<br>4.5                                           | % of staff trained: 75.8%                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Image: SDG 5 and SDG 10                                |\n| Health, safety<br>and working<br>conditions                    | Section<br>2.2 Risks<br>related to personnel<br>(moderate)        | Section<br>4.6                                           | Frequency rate of work-<br>related accidents: 7.14<br>(target: 7.50)<br>Severity rate of work-<br>related accidents: 0.29<br>(target: 0.33)                                                                                                      | Image: SDG 3 and SDG 8                                 |\n| Climate change                                                 | Section 2.2<br>Environmental risks<br>(moderate)                  | Section<br>4.7.1<br>Section<br>4.7.2<br>Section<br>4.7.4 | Energy consumption by<br>source:<br>- Gas: -21.5%<br>(target in 2024: -8.0%)<br>- Electricity: -8.0%<br>(target in 2024: -8.0%)<br>Greenhouse gas<br>emissions (scope 1<br>excluding kerosene and<br>scope 2): -20.8% (target in<br>2024: -8.0%) | Image: SDG 9 and SDG 13                                |\n| Traceability and<br>obsolescence of<br>hazardous<br>substances | Section 2.3.2<br>Compliance<br>(low)                              | Section<br>4.7.2                                         | Number of substituted<br>hazardous products: 494                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Image: SDG 3 and SDG 12                                |\n| supply chain:<br>customer duty                                 | Section 2.3.1<br>Corporate social<br>responsibility<br>(moderate) | Section<br>4.8.3<br>Section<br>4.8.6                     | % of new suppliers<br>processed: 100%<br>(target: 100%)<br>% of suppliers with a<br>negative opinion: 0.8%                                                                                                                                       | Image: SDG 8 and SDG 12                                |\n| Business ethics                                                | Section 2.3.1<br>Corporate social<br>responsibility<br>(moderate) | Section<br>4.8.7<br>Section<br>4.8.8                     | Number of acts of<br>corruption: 0<br>(target: 0)<br>Number of people trained:<br>755<br>(2393 since 2018)                                                                                                                                       | Image: SDG 16                                          |\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5. Offering an attractive and motivating employment model**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/5 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Each icon features a number and a title above a symbolic image, all set against a colored square background. SDG 5 is on a red background and shows the gender equality symbol. SDG 8 is on a maroon background and shows an upward trending line graph. SDG 10 is on a pink background and shows an equals sign inside a circle.\n\nThe development of the Dassault Aviation Group is based on the quality and commitment of its people. They are its main source of wealth. This principle is enshrined in the Code of Ethics.\n\n| Changes in registered headcount  | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2023 | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Dassault Aviation Parent Company | 9,778                            | 9,201                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Jet              | 2,052                            | 1,878                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Service          | 571                              | 556                              |\n| Sogitec                          | 288                              | 272                              |\n| DABS FBO/DABS                    | 373                              | 434                              |\n| ExecuJet                         | 471                              | 427                              |\n| Total                            | 13,533                           | 12,768                           |\n\n| Changes in active headcounts     | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2023 | Headcount<br>as at<br>12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Dassault Aviation Parent Company | 9,347                            | 8,825                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Jet              | 2,046                            | 1,862                            |\n| Dassault Falcon Service          | 508                              | 500                              |\n| Sogitec                          | 279                              | 262                              |\n| DABS FBO/DABS                    | 359                              | 416                              |\n| ExecuJet                         | 461                              | 419                              |\n| Total                            | 13,000                           | 12,284                           |\n\nMore than 96% of the Group's employees are on open-ended contracts. The geographical distribution of the Group's headcount is as follows:\n\n| France            | 79% |\n|-------------------|-----|\n| Americas          | 15% |\n| Rest of the world | 6%  |\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5.1. Attracting and retaining talent**\n\nThe Group's Companies invest in preparing the talents who will join us after completing their studies or retraining.\n\nThe Group thus works in cooperation with the academic and research community.\n\nIn this context, the Group's companies:\n\n- support students during their studies through internships, work-study programs and France's international business volunteer program (VIE – Volontariat International en Entreprise). In 2023, the Group's companies took on 489 interns (35 VIE participants) and 344 work-study students, thus demonstrating the willingness to support the training of young people in our businesses and facilitate their entry into professional life. More than 45% of French subsidiary apprentices were hired at the end of their apprenticeships.\n- participate in consultations on how to adapt curricula to the medium and long-term needs of the aviation industry. These consultations are carried out within professional bodies such as GIFAS, and with educational institutions and organizations (engineering colleges, universities, vocational high schools),\n- encourage their staff to take part in vocational or multidisciplinary courses and examination boards and to supervise technical projects,\n- make their recruiters available to educational institutions several times a year to prepare future graduates for recruitment interviews,\n- promote an awareness of our business lines by organizing meetings (forums, Group presentations, etc.) and visits to our sites for pupils, students and their advisors (teachers, career counselors, principals, etc.). Targeted actions for middle school and high school students have been carried out to foster diversity within technical and scientific professions.\n\nWe also contribute to the general skills development of future technicians, engineers and researchers by creating or participating in teaching and research chairs. This takes the form of financial support, which we supplement with the participation of our experts in the development of educational and research projects for the benefit of the academic and scientific community.\n\nDue to the major recruitment demand for manufacturing staff for the Dassault Aviation Parent Company, around ten training programs have been set up with external bodies to \"build skills\" and support people undergoing retraining with professional certification in metallurgy at the end of the course (CQPM - Certificat de Qualification Paritaire de la Métallurgie). A school of mechanics was created in April 2023 at Dassault Aviation's Argonay site. This specific and made-to-measure training course was designed by our teams and is taught by in-house trainers and partner organizations: AFPI-Etudoc and IMAA.\n\n### *Measures undertaken in India*\n\nThe Indian government-approved Dassault Skill Academy was created in 2018 to develop new training courses in India for the aviation industry. It was designed to be a two-year training course equivalent to the French professional aviation diploma (Baccalauréat professionnel aéronautique). Since the start of the 2019/2020 school year, the training has been based in a public high school in Nagpur (Maharashtra State). The high school teachers were trained by French teachers and are now qualified to take over. Building on this success, the project was then rolled out in two new professional high schools in the state of Maharashtra. Since then, all graduates have been recruited by various aviation companies in Maharashtra and Telangana.\n\nIn 2023, the Indian government signed a partnership agreement with our subsidiary in India for the creation of the \"Dassault Aviation Center of Excellence for Aeronautical Vocational Training\" within the National Skill Training Institute in Kanpur (state of Uttar Pradesh). This center of excellence will help prepare future Indian teachers for the widespread roll-out of this training.\n\nWith regard to higher education, a network of excellence bringing together Nagpur's VNIT (Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology - the city's largest engineering school), CESI (the Nanterre school of engineering in France) and Dassault Aviation, was founded in 2023 through the signing of partnerships. These partnerships will allow both schools to set up academic and research exchanges and also bring Indian students selected by Dassault Reliance Aviation Limited (DRAL) to France to complete the final year of their studies. An academic semester at CESI followed by an internship at Dassault Aviation\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nprepares students for recruitment at DRAL, giving them a taste of the products, tools, processes and the Dassault culture in general.\n\n#### *Paris Le Bourget Air Show*\n\nDuring the International Paris Le Bourget Air Show, the Group's companies took part in the fifth edition of the \"Careers Plane.\" Almost 50 Group employees presented their professions - fitters, layout fitters, system architects, structural mechanics and maintenance engineers - to inspire young people to enter the trade.\n\nDuring the Paris Le Bourget Air Show, the Group also took part in the Paris Air Lab, an exhibition dedicated to innovation, where our specialists presented the \"FalconWays\" project, a flight optimization tool which allows pilots to select the most efficient route to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions.\n\nDuring the \"L'Aéro Recrute\" recruitment event, organized by GIFAS, more than 80 Group employees welcomed a great number of visitors, providing them with information and advice to guide them in their career choices.\n\n#### *Communication initiatives*\n\nTo enhance its employer brand image, the Group has bolstered its presence on social media and become more vocal about its recruitment needs, increasing the number of actions to be more visible at a national and local level.\n\nIn 2023, the Parent Company once again featured in the TOP 5 of the Universum France ranking of the 130 best places to work, across all sectors, according to engineering students. It was also ranked number one in the \"Aerospace, rail, naval\" sector of the Statista rankings for the economics magazine CAPITAL (out of 39 companies ranked in the sector).\n\nDespite the pressures on the job market in 2023, the Group continued recruiting by seeking the best possible match between costs, headcount and skills requirements.\n\nAs a result of this policy, 1,947 employees were recruited in 2023.\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/13 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing data from 2023 and 2022. The bar for 2023 is blue and has a value of 1947. The bar for 2022 is gray and has a value of 1564.\n\nTo facilitate the integration of their new hires, the Group's companies have put in place programs that explain their business, set-up and operation.\n\nDassault Aviation has significantly improved its employee onboarding process with the launch of two new schemes:\n\n- \"Les Journées Envol\" (Take-off Days) allow new hires to discover Dassault Aviation's history and business alongside Directors and pilots,\n- The Dassault Defense Academy presents the geopolitical context, France's defense policy, the structure of the national army corps and the role of the military in Dassault Aviation's DNA.\n\nDFJ invites all new employees and interns to take part in the \"Welcome to Dassault Falcon Jet Passport\" program. This scheme provides access to a LinkedIn Learning platform where employees can access more than 16,000 courses taught by industry experts covering sales, innovation and technology subjects.\n\nRecruitment and onboarding initiatives are essential. They help prepare for the future and facilitate the intergenerational transfer of skills.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Employees leaving the Group**\n\nImage /page/97/Figure/3 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing values for 2023 and 2022. The bar for 2023 is blue and has a value of 1182. The bar for 2022 is gray and has a value of 1167.\n\nAmong employees leaving the Group, the resignation rate is around 3% of the workforce.\n\n### **4.5.2. Development and transfer of skills**\n\nIndividual development of each employee is an essential condition of collective success. With 75,8% of employees trained in 2023, the Group has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining and developing its employees' skills.\n\n### **Vocational training**\n\nGroup companies continue to develop distance learning in the skills development plan. These measures also address the constraints of geographical dispersion and optimize future skills development for employees. The initiatives took into account the operational needs of the Group's companies, the development of the roles and technologies, and individual development preferences. Professional training represents 293,275 hours of training.\n\nDassault Falcon Jet also relies on a tuition assistance plan to enable its employees to join a higher education program that will develop their skills. This program, directly related to the position held by the employee, reflects his or her career development prospects. A total of 337 employees have benefited from this scheme since it was set up.\n\n### **Skills Conservatory and support for digital tools**\n\nAs part of its skills conservatory, Dassault Aviation launched a pipe fitter training course in 2023 that had been tested at the end of 2022. This course rounds out the range of training courses for professions such as process planners and assemblers. Moreover, the functional business lines also have targeted courses covering business-specific issues, such as the Purchasing Passport and the Supply Chain Academy. The latter focuses on synergies between all vocations that work in the supply chain.\n\n### **Strengthening the Group's management**\n\nStrengthening its management is a priority for the Dassault Aviation Group, which guides the development of its managers throughout their career. The Dassault Institute has continued to hold training courses for the Group's French subsidiaries. In 2023, 492 managers or future managers of the Group's French companies were trained.\n\nMore specifically, Dassault Aviation launched a support plan for its managers to help them communicate and inform their teams about the impact of the new collective bargaining agreement for the metallurgy industry that has been in force in France since January 1, 2024. A total of 1,128 managers were thus trained under this plan.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, DABS continued with its \"Shaping our Future\" program which was launched in 2022. A total of 90% of managers therefore started the Managerial Training Cycle covering the first two themes: the role of manager and the manager coach. Five other themes will be covered during 2024.\n\n### **4.5.3. Promoting diversity and equal opportunities**\n\nThe Group promotes diversity in the workplace and is highly committed to the principles of nondiscrimination. Firmly believing that diversity is a major issue and a performance factor for the company, the Group restates its commitment to preventing discrimination and is committed to promoting equal opportunities and treatment in compliance with national regulations.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the signing of company-level agreements in the following areas:\n\n- professional equality between women and men,\n- employment and retention in employment of persons with disabilities,\n- careers of staff representatives.\n\n### **Gender equality at work**\n\nThe Group pursues its policy of developing gender balance in the company by implementing specific measures, particularly in the technical, industrial, management and aircraft maintenance professions.\n\nThe Group is facing the issue of fewer women enrolling in initial technical and industrial training courses. The development of scientific and technical careers among women is therefore an important issue.\n\nVarious initiatives are aimed at girls in middle school and high school to encourage them to take vocational courses relevant to the aviation sector; Dassault Aviation is a founding member of the association \"Elles bougent\" (\"Girls on the Move\").\n\nOn March 8, 2022, Dassault Aviation signed the charter \"Féminisons les métiers de l'aéronautique et du spatial\" (\"Women in the aeronautics and space industry\"). Signatories to the charter can share best practices and take part in initiatives organized by Airemploi to showcase career opportunities in the aviation industry and debunk stereotypes and prejudices. By signing the charter, Dassault Aviation has underlined its commitment to gender diversity within the industry.\n\nDFS and Dassault Aviation also took part in the \"Women in the Aeronautics Industry\" drive launched for the Paris Le Bourget Air Show.\n\nWomen account for 18.9% of the Group's workforce, a slight increase from 2022. As a result of the Group's proactive policy, women made up 22.2% of all recruits in 2023 (excluding apprentices).\n\nConcerning the French companies of the Group, this percentage is 23.7%, and 24.2% for Dassault Aviation Parent Company.\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/18 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing data from 2023 and 2022. In 2023, the total is 13,533, with women representing 18.9% and men representing 81.1%. In 2022, the total is 12,768, with women representing 18.6% and men representing 81.4%. The chart includes a legend indicating that the lighter blue color represents women and the darker blue color represents men.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this regard, the recent appointment of a woman at the head of Technical Management Department could serve as a fresh source of inspiration for a great many women within the Group or interested in joining it.\n\nThe Group also pays particular attention to the training and development of women's careers, helping to promote them to positions of responsibility, particularly in management and senior management.\n\nThe Group is also mindful of gender equality in its compensation and promotion policies. The French companies have a compiled gender equality score of 87 out of 100. This is well above the regulatory threshold of 75.\n\nThe Group's French Companies all have an agreement on gender equality and equal pay. Priority is given to initiatives to recruit women in all professional categories and to support their career development so that they can go on to hold positions of responsibility.\n\n### **Employment and retention in employment of persons with disabilities**\n\nThe Group continues its policy of recruitment and retention of persons with disabilities. The Group's French Companies all have an agreement on hiring and retaining people with disabilities.\n\nRegular communication initiatives are carried out, particularly with the academic community, local organizations for the employment of disabled people and disability-friendly companies. The Group's companies participate in specialized forums and organize awareness-raising actions with employees and recruiters.\n\nDassault Aviation is a member of the association Hanvol, which offers a unique training scheme for the return to work of disabled people with diverse backgrounds and skills but a shared goal: to work in the aerospace sector.\n\nConcrete measures are being taken to modify workstations and to facilitate and encourage formal recognition of the status of employees with disabilities and renewal of that recognition. The Group relies on cooperation between its HR teams, medical professionals from occupational health services, EHS staff and ergonomists to institute the necessary initiatives and arrangements to retain employees with disabilities. The Parent Company has earmarked an annual budget of EUR 400,000 for the period 2021- 2023.\n\nAn awareness campaign focused on disability in sports was launched in November 2023 during European Disabled Workers Week across all nine of the Parent Company's facilities. The campaign featured role plays, quizzes, and demonstrations of adaptation solutions to raise awareness surrounding disability.\n\nThe Group is also committed to ensuring that employees with disabilities benefit from the same opportunities for pay increases and career advancement as other employees.\n\nIn late 2023, the Dassault Aviation Group employed 607 disabled workers, compared to 578 in 2022. The Group has a disabled employment rate of more than 6% across the three entities, in compliance with French employment law.\n\n#### **Careers of staff representatives**\n\nDassault Aviation and Dassault Falcon Service are implementing agreements signed in 2019 on social dialog to facilitate the functioning of union organizations and staff representative institutions. More specifically, those agreements provide a career monitoring mechanism for the careers of staff representatives to ensure equal treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the French Companies of the Group give employee representative institutions many additional resources compared to those provided for by law.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.5.4. Offering attractive compensation and benefits**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group is committed to attracting talent and keeping its employees highly motivated by offering them stimulating projects along with an attractive compensation policy.\n\nThis compensation policy rewards and inspires loyalty among its employees, while adapting to the economic situation and the economic environment to maintain the Group's competitiveness in a highly competitive market. Employee retention is illustrated by the average length of service of 13.3 years.\n\nThe average annual pay of Group employees in 2023 was EUR 62,480.\n\nThe average annual gross salary for a non-managerial employee was EUR 39,644 in 2023, which is 1.9 times the French minimum wage (SMIC). To this is added any team bonuses and overtime (or other) which represent on average nearly 10% of the salary.\n\nDassault Aviation has a redistribution policy that is fully in keeping with its value-sharing philosophy. Dassault Aviation has chosen not to have a share award policy; instead it has opted for a direct contribution to the company's performance through an attractive redistribution policy based on profitsharing and incentive schemes. The Group's French companies have signed profit-sharing opt-out agreements and particularly advantageous incentive agreements, enabling employees to have a share in the profits. In all, 78.6% of the Group's employees benefit from these schemes. The amounts awarded over the last five years have represented on average 3.1 months of salary for the employees of Dassault Aviation Parent Company.\n\nThe average annual pay of the Group's French Companies, including profit-sharing and incentives, was EUR 77,875. For Dassault Aviation, the lowest salary was EUR 37,465, including the profit-sharing paid in 2023 relative to 2022, and EUR 35,215, including the average profit-sharing paid for the last 5 years.\n\nThese companies also promote employee savings by offering company savings plans with a wide choice of investments, as well as a group pension plan.\n\nThe Group offers all its employees medical cover.\n\nThe Group's French companies paid more than EUR 30 million (i.e. more than 5% of the payroll) to the social and economic committees at their facilities, enabling employees to enjoy numerous social and cultural activities. The budget will also fund various sports associations for the benefit of all employees who want to play sports or do physical exercise.\n\n#### **4.5.5. Constructive employee relations**\n\nThe Group has an employee relations policy which is built on trust, compromise, and mutual respect.\n\nTrade unions representing the professional interests of employees are present in all French subsidiaries and DFJ Do Brasil. They cover more than 78% of the Group's workforce.\n\nIn Group entities with employee representative bodies, regular negotiations give rise to constructive social dialog based on the search for collective agreement.\n\nIn 2023, 24 agreements and amendments were signed. These notably covered subjects including pay, pensions, gender equality, hiring and retaining people with disabilities, the roll-out of the new branch collective bargaining agreement and the organization of professional elections.\n\nRegular constructive discussions with social partners mean that any changes which the Group is going through can be taken into account accordingly. For the Group's French companies, 2023 saw the continuation of discussions with social partners regarding the challenges and roll out of the new branch collective bargaining agreement which was signed in February 2022.\n\nThis social dialog within the Group helps to maintain a climate conducive to the proper functioning of the companies. For the French companies, more than 130 meetings were held between the Management and members of the social and economic committees and more than 46 meetings between the Management and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committees. Social dialog is also expressed at joint committee meetings during which plans for the organization of the Group's companies, questions of employment and gender equality, and issues around health, safety and working conditions, among others, are discussed. This social agenda provides a framework for employee relations and allows staff representatives to stay up to date on the issues facing the Group.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, some Group entities that do not have staff representatives have set up direct communication channels with senior management.\n\n### **4.6. Ensuring a high-quality, safe and healthy work environment**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/5 description: The image contains two icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first icon, on the left, is green and represents SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. It features a white heartbeat symbol. The second icon, on the right, is maroon and represents SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features a white upward-trending line graph.\n\n### **4.6.1. Fostering an effective culture of prevention throughout the company**\n\nThe Group continued developing a safety culture in 2023, in line with the CSR policy defined in 2020. This involves the sustainability of practices and tools that promote proactive management of occupational health and safety and the training and awareness-raising of those involved in prevention.\n\nSince 2022, the Parent Company has had a fully operational environment, health and safety (EHS) training course for new managers, consisting of four modules. Moreover, EHS aspects are being gradually incorporated into vocational training courses so that they can be applied in practice.\n\nAt the end of 2023, a managerial roadshow including EHS aspects was launched to improve daily good practices.\n\nIn this respect, Dassault Aviation has designed an EHS management framework built around four levels of maturity, in line with the ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 standards, with level one corresponding to basic proficiency and level four to operational excellence. At the end of 2023, six Parent Company facilities, representing 81% of staff, had achieved, or were very close to achieving level three status. Actions plans remain underway at the other facilities.\n\n### **4.6.2. Continuing to reduce occupational risks and improve working conditions**\n\nControlling the risk of workplace accidents and occupational diseases means reducing physical and chemical risks.\n\nActions to manage chemical risk are ongoing. In 2023, the Company continued with efforts to provide additional collective protection, such as the installation of new bonding booths for canopies and windshields, the installation of extractor hoods and equipment for paint touch-ups, and the improvement of local extraction systems.\n\nEfforts continued to make working at height safer, ensuring that this work is carried out safely on the Falcon production line or on the roofs of buildings.\n\nGroup-wide, absenteeism in 2023 was 96,866 days from all causes, compared with 112,843 in 2022, excluding maternity and parental leave.\n\nThe number of work-related accidents with lost time was 149 in 2023. The corresponding number of days lost was 6,005 days.\n\nThe Group frequency rate (FR) has decreased over the past ten years, from 10.97 in 2013 to 7.14 in 2023.\n\nThe severity rate (SR) dropped from 0.39 to 0.29.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/3 description: This line graph compares the values of FR and SR from 2012 to 2023. The FR line starts at 10.21 in 2012, peaks at 10.97 in 2013, then decreases to 8.38 in 2014 and 8.44 in 2015. It rises to 9.57 in 2016 and 8.77 in 2017, then slightly decreases to 8.68 in 2018 before rising to 9.13 in 2019. The line then drops to 6.24 in 2020, rises to 7.67 in 2021, and plateaus at 7.13 in 2022 and 7.14 in 2023. The SR line starts at 0.42 in 2012, decreases to 0.33 in 2013 and 0.32 in 2014, then drops to 0.28 in 2015. It rises to 0.39 in 2016 and remains at 0.39 in 2017, then decreases to 0.31 in 2018 and 0.30 in 2019. The line then rises to 0.33 in 2020, 0.38 in 2021, and 0.39 in 2022 before dropping to 0.29 in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, 28 occupational illnesses were identified by the various competent authorities, compared with 15 in 2022. These were primarily musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n#### **4.6.3. Developing quality of life at work and fostering employee well-being**\n\n### **Ergonomics and working conditions**\n\nTo promote a culture of ergonomics and ensure that ergonomic considerations are factored into new projects and programs, training courses are held. Moreover, more than 80 ergonomics officers have been trained across all sites.\n\nErgonomics are taken into account in the industrialization phase via a specific \"EHS/ergonomics\" training module delivered by the Dassault Aviation conservatory; this is an integral part of the vocational course for process planners and toolmakers. A total of 56 employees have been trained since it was set up in 2021.\n\nLastly, a network of 15 trainers specializing in risk prevention during physical activities and in body posture and movement provide training at the Parent Company's facilities. In 2023, 220 employees attended these training courses, learning about what actions they can take to prevent musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nAt the same time, the workplace transformation to take better account of ergonomics continued in 2023, focusing on:\n\n- reducing the risk of accidents linked to manual load handling by purchasing suitable equipment (trolleys, stacker trucks, lifting platforms, hoists, etc.), reorganizing storage facilities, and redesigning tools to make them more lightweight,\n- addressing the causes of musculoskeletal disorders (setting up and equipping workstations, workbenches and desks so that they can be raised, lowered and/or reclined, using pivotable tripods and testing exoskeletons for the thumb, neck, back and arms/shoulders),\n- The reduction of noise pollution in shared offices: provision of active noise-reduction headphones (6,000 employees to be equipped over three years – 2023/2025),\n- accommodating disabilities; adapting workstations, purchasing suitable equipment, etc.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Preventing psychosocial risks**\n\nA renewed focus has been placed on psychosocial risks. In 2021, the Parent Company introduced a system for assessing collective psychosocial risks in the workplace in order to gauge the risk and take the necessary corrective measures.\n\nWhen the Quality of Life and Working Conditions agreement was renegotiated and signed on February 14, 2023, the Parent Company undertook to introduce a new mechanism in 2024 to assess psychosocial risks for each company employee. Specific support will be offered to managers to analyze the results of this assessment and launch any necessary action plans.\n\nThe system will supplement the detection and monitoring of individual psychosocial risks carried out by internal or inter-company occupational health services.\n\nDassault Aviation has an agreement in place with the Psychological Support and Resources Institute (IAPR), which offers a listening and support system for employees who are victims of workplace stress and psychological trauma.\n\nTo prevent harassment, sexist behavior, sexual assault and discrimination at work, the Group's companies have introduced internal mechanisms for identifying and dealing with problematic situations. Formalized procedures have been published, notably at Dassault Aviation and ExecuJet, covering more than 75% of employees.\n\nIn 2023, the Parent Company also continued the practice launched in 2022 of arranging meetings enabling employees to discuss with their manager what actions could be taken to work together better. Nearly 900 meetings were held in 2023. This long-term approach is part of the agreement relating to quality of life and conditions at work.\n\n#### **Quality of life at work**\n\nThe Group has long encouraged a work/life balance, particularly through schemes to help parents.\n\nSome Group companies provide access to an inter-company crèche.\n\nSince 2021, Dassault Aviation has implemented a digital and physical corporate concierge scheme, offering employees local services that are readily accessible and that help them manage personal tasks. The services available are regularly updated to meet employees' needs. The digital concierges will now be offering one-off physical onsite services (such as bike repair, etc.).\n\nWorking hours also contribute to quality of life at work. Tailoring working hours to accommodate the personal needs of individual employees leads to a more flexible organization and improves shift management within the Group's French Companies. All Group companies offer part-time hours, subject to the manager's approval. More than 78% of the Group's workforce has a \"working time account\" to help employees manage their annual leave.\n\nThe Group's French Companies have signed company-level agreements on remote working, balancing personal and professional life while maintaining collective efficiency.\n\nIn terms of societal challenges, mobility is also a matter of concern for employees. The Parent Company has introduced a sustainable mobility scheme, through which the company contributes up to EUR 200 toward the purchase of a manual or electric bicycle. In 2023, 328 bonuses were paid through this scheme. The Parent Company's facilities are improving their infrastructure to accommodate bicycles and ensure their safe use.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Medical monitoring of employees**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has autonomous occupational health services or assistance programs at all of its sites.\n\nEmployees in high-risk positions or who are expatriates or on mission receive specific monitoring and specialized additional support. This includes more regular medical check-ups and additional examinations paid for by the Group.\n\nPrevention and awareness campaigns, local or Group-wide, are organized, periodically or occasionally, on a variety of themes, professional or public-health related:\n\n- influenza (awareness campaign and free vaccinations),\n- heat wave-related risks,\n- low back pain and injuries from carrying heavy loads,\n- help with addiction (tobacco, alcohol, psychotropic products, games, cyberdependency),\n- food hygiene,\n- psychosocial risks,\n- cardiovascular diseases,\n- organ donation,\n- sleep disorders.\n\n### **4.7. Improving the environmental performance of our activities and products**\n\n#### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/104/Figure/18 description: The image shows four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) which is green and features a white heartbeat symbol; SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) which is orange and features a white cube structure; SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) which is brown and features a white infinity symbol with arrows; and SDG 13 (Climate Action) which is green and features a white eye looking at the earth.\n\nThe environment is the core focus of Dassault Aviation's CSR policy. The aim is to reduce the footprint of the Group's products and activities, while mitigating the risks of pollution and environmental damage. The policy takes the form of an environmental methodology (\"Eco-démarche\") consisting of projects and actions to improve environmental performance throughout the life cycle of our products.\n\nReducing our environmental footprint means factoring EHS requirements into aircraft development programs, into contracts with suppliers and partners, into the search for new processes and materials, into plans for new infrastructure or production facilities, and into the operational support given to our customers.\n\nThe Group has been committed to this proactive environmental approach for more than 15 years, relying to that end on the ISO 14001 management standard. The Group's research offices and production facilities are certified. This includes all Dassault Aviation sites, the Dassault Falcon Jet facility in Little Rock and the Dassault Falcon Service locations in Le Bourget and Mérignac. Together the certified sites represent almost 90% of the Company's total workforce.\n\n#### **4.7.1. Factoring eco-design into the search for innovative technical solutions**\n\nOver the past 40 years, technological progress with regard to engine efficiency, aerodynamics and weight saving has reduced fuel consumption, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions and noise levels from our aircraft. The Group is continuing on this path, both in the search for technological innovations and in the optimization of the aircraft in operation.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo support this strategy, the Group has long embraced the goals set in 2000 by the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) and participates in European studies that contribute to them, such as the CleanSky program and its successor, Clean Aviation.\n\nIn France, Dassault Aviation, as a member of the Civil Aviation Research Guidance Council (CORAC), is involved in the studies conducted in that framework. Dassault Aviation is also on the steering committee for the air transport value chain (Article 301 of the French Climate and Resilience Act) and contributed to the publication of the road map for decarbonizing air transport presented to the French government on February 14, 2023.\n\nDassault Aviation reiterated its commitment in June 2023 during the International Paris Le Bourget Air Show by signing a statement with six other major aviation players (Airbus, Boeing, GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce and Safran), acknowledging their shared objective of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and underlining the importance of the production and availability of sustainable aviation fuel to achieve this objective. In October 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) invited Member States to achieve the same target for international civil aviation. In September 2023, the ICCAIA (International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Association) set out the commitment of manufacturers to supply products that are 100% SAF compatible by 2030.\n\n### **Environmental footprint of aircraft**\n\nThe environmental footprint is modeled using a life-cycle analysis (LCA) approach, in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, for the Falcon 8X, Falcon 7X and Falcon 2000. The modeling identifies the impact of each stage in the aircraft's life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its end-of-life solution. Various indicators are used: the potential for global warming, the depletion of natural resources, the depletion of the ozone layer, the potential for acidification and the eutrophication of water.\n\nThese studies show that aircraft use accounts for more than 95% of greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life cycle, while highlighting the significant contribution of the kerosene production phase. On that basis, Dassault Aviation has directed most of its efforts toward improving energy efficiency during the operational phase and promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), while also maintaining projects to improve other environmental aspects, such as the choice of bio-sourced materials in the fittings of Falcon cabins.\n\nThe long service life of aircraft (potentially more than 30 years) means that life cycle constraints must be anticipated in the design phase. To achieve this, Dassault Aviation takes an innovative approach, supported by efficient digital industrial processes such as Product Lifecycle Management.\n\nThe aircraft sold by Dassault Aviation are repairable throughout their operation and offer significant endof-life recyclability potential (85%, according to the ISO 22 628 standard defining the calculation methodology for road vehicles, in the absence of a similar standard for aircraft). This is due to the reusable equipment and the materials used (such as aluminum in particular).\n\n### **Technological aircraft innovation**\n\nDassault Aviation is engaged in European and national initiatives (Clean Sky and Clean Aviation) and leads or participates in concept and development studies in conjunction with the entire aviation sector. These studies relate to:\n\n- reducing the weight of primary structures with new materials and processes (new metal alloys, composites),\n- reducing the weight of some complete equipment and components and lowering the \"buy to fly ratio,\" i.e., the ratio between the quantity of materials of a part and the quantity of materials purchased and transported to make it (metal additive manufacturing, thermoplastics),\n- consolidating the principles of design and manufacture of surfaces with increased laminar flow and performance, achievable due to the drag reduction thus obtained,\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n- using sustainable aviation fuels, which must be compatible with fuel systems and engines when blended with conventional kerosene at high percentage levels, with the aim of achieving 100% SAF operation,\n- optimizing flight planning and management to reduce fuel consumption, launched under the commercial name FalconWays,\n- optimizing take-off and landing trajectories to reduce ground noise,\n- researching concepts and technologies for noise reduction at source, without adversely affecting aircraft mass and/or aerodynamic drag.\n\nIn addition, work on the \"certifiability\" of disruptive technologies, with specific demonstrations and associated numerical modeling, is being done as part of Clean Aviation's Concerto project, coordinated by Dassault Aviation in partnership with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\n#### **Methods and processes**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group is pursuing its efforts to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of its design methods, production processes and maintenance services by harnessing the tools offered by digital technology:\n\n- co-engineering methods are tested and implemented to ensure the best trade-offs between design, production and support,\n- the optimization of the entire testing process (new types of instrumentation, processing and data analysis) and hybridization of simulation models and test data reduces the number of development flight tests and the processing cycle for any adjustments,\n- advances in digital technology help demonstrate why the aircraft meets the certification criteria,\n- efforts to optimize the production cycle are taking the form of research into eco-design, new materials, additive manufacturing and waste recycling,\n- alternative solutions are being sought for the treatment and protection of parts against corrosion, such as the removal of chromates from the processes,\n- the development of algorithms for automated fleet data processing aims to increase predictive maintenance capabilities.\n\n### **Optimization of aircraft in operation**\n\nThanks to its longstanding contribution to French (CORAC) and European (SESAR, CleanSky/CleanAviation) research programs, as well as through its own self-funded research, Dassault Aviation is capable of developing and integrating the most advanced technologies in its aircraft to minimize the environmental footprint of the Falcon fleet and in particular its CO<sup>2</sup> emissions: preparation and optimization of flight planning, flight assistance systems such as FalconEye cameras/head up displays, navigation and communication systems.\n\nWe share best practices and flight optimization recommendations with Falcon fleet operators. The aim is to maximize the environmental efficiency of flight operations. This includes optimizing loads on board, the flight profile in terms of speed and altitude and flight paths. These practices are supported by onboard digital tools made available to pilots, such as the new FalconWays solution. This software takes into account real-time weather data to allow pilots the option of adjusting flight plans to optimize the use of winds at different altitudes and thus reduce fuel consumption and therefore the associated emissions.\n\nFor optimal flight efficiency, it is also important that aircraft maintenance is carried out according to a set schedule. Our teams work actively on a daily basis at our maintenance centers around the world to carry out operations which keep Falcon aircraft operating at peak operational and environmental efficiency. Our maintenance centers, as Group subsidiaries, are also committed to reducing their carbon footprint in line with the CSR policy. This is achieved through the implementation of energy saving plans targeting the heating and electricity supply of the centers, but also through the gradual introduction of carbon-free maintenance resources, such as electric runway generators and airfield tractors.\n\nPilots working for our Falcon customers are made aware of these best practices and environmental issues at special meetings or at events during international trade shows and forums.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)**\n\nFalcon models are already SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) compatible and certified for a blend limit of 50%.\n\nDassault Aviation is working with the engine and equipment manufacturers of its aircraft currently in development to validate the feasibility of 100% SAF in its new models for the entry into service of the Falcon 10X. The same goal is shared by the VOLCAN project, in which Dassault Aviation is involved in partnership with Airbus, ONERA, Safran and the DGAC (Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile – the French Civil Aviation Authority). We are preparing all of our models currently in production for the use of SAF above the current blend limit of 50%, in line with the industry-wide objective of achieving compatibility with a 100% blend of sustainable fuel by 2030.\n\nThe SAF plan, which was launched in 2022, continued in 2023 and will continue in 2024. As a result, we are using SAF for our operations out of French airports Le Bourget and Bordeaux-Mérignac, as well as from our Little Rock facility (United States). Levels of SAF uplifted currently varies between 25% and 35% depending on our suppliers' capacities, with this percentage substantially ahead of the ReFuelEU European Directive which is targeting 2% SAF in 2025 and 6% in 2030. This demonstrates the commitment of the business aviation industry to decarbonize as quickly as possible.\n\nA total of 413 flights were operated with SAF in 2023, representing a reduction of 681 TCO2eq.\n\nThe overall reduction in CO<sup>2</sup> emissions over the life cycle of SAF (production followed by use in flight) is close to 80-90%, according to international benchmarks. During their combustion, SAF also release fewer pollutants into the atmosphere, such as sulfur, and could help to limit the production of condensation trails.\n\nSAF supply chains are taking shape. Dassault Aviation is committed to promoting the use of SAF in its own operations and in those of its customers, working closely with GAMA, NBAA and EBAA.\n\nDassault Aviation has been a member of the RLCF (Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance) since its creation in 2022. The alliance, launched by the European Commission, is the industrial pillar of the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which aims to phase in progressively SAF by 2050.\n\n### **4.7.2. Reducing our environmental footprint according to the principles of the circular economy**\n\nAs part of its CSR policy, Dassault Aviation has set three-year targets for reducing its environmental footprint. The desired performance improvement targets energy consumption, water consumption, air emissions and waste recovery.\n\nThe targets initially set for 2021-2023 based on the available performance analysis were revised in 2022 to reflect guidance on energy saving from the French government. The year 2020, disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis, is not representative of the Company's activities. The year 2019 was therefore chosen as the reference year.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Themes                                                        |                                             | 2024 targets<br>(Ref. 2019) | 2023             | 2022             | Group performance<br>Like-for-like change since 2019* |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                               | Electricity (GJ)                            | -8%                         | 499,936          | 500,596          | -8.0%                                                 |\n|                                                               | Self-produced renewable electricity (GJ)    | 40,000                      | 1,006            | Not available**  | NA                                                    |\n|                                                               | Gas (GJ)                                    | -8%                         | 281,471          | 312,634          | -21.5%                                                |\n| Optimize consumption of resources                             | Other sources – heating oil and diesel (GJ) | Stability                   | 7,297            | 7,804            | -56.7%                                                |\n|                                                               | TOTAL                                       | -8%                         | 789,710          | 821,034          | -13.5%                                                |\n|                                                               | Kerosene (GJ)                               | NA                          | 411,770          | 506,992          | -26.0%                                                |\n|                                                               | SAF 30% (m3)                                | 2,900                       | 1,016            | 369              | N/A                                                   |\n|                                                               | Water (m3)                                  | Stability                   | 215,654          | 230,401          | -11.4%                                                |\n| Minimize the use of hazardous chemicals                       | Hazardous products removed or substituted   | NA                          | 494 (since 2013) | 405 (since 2013) | 138.00                                                |\n|                                                               | VOC (T)                                     | Stability                   | 97               | 110              | -41.3%                                                |\n| Reduce waste generation and discharges into the water and air | Non-hazardous waste (T)                     | Stability                   | 7,207            | 6,187            | 0.9%                                                  |\n|                                                               | Hazardous waste (T)                         | Stability                   | 1,788            | 1,425            | -34.1%                                                |\n|                                                               | Total waste (T)                             | Stability                   | 8,995            | 7,629            | -8.3%                                                 |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\n\\*\\*Production began in 2022 and is currently in the test phase; consolidated data as of 2023.\n\n### **Energy consumption**\n\nThe energy management system is integrated with the ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. There is no plan for ISO 50001 certification.\n\nA network of energy experts, trained in 2022, was set up at the Parent Company level to improve energy performance management and the rollout of improvements, particularly those resulting from the energy audits carried out at Dassault Aviation facilities in late 2019. Regulatory energy audits were carried out in 2023 and will contribute to improving action plans.\n\nEnergy is mostly consumed within the framework of the industrial activity of the production sites (electricity and gas), and the aviation activity (kerosene).\n\nElectricity consumption remains stable compared to 2022 despite an increase in the number of hours worked, as a result of the energy-saving efforts made by all of the Group's entities, including behavioral change, reducing equipment operating ranges, optimizing temperatures in server rooms, installing LED lighting and optimizing consumption management.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nDirector's report\n\nGas consumption decreased significantly owing to the beneficial impact of temperature reduction recommendations, the improvement in technical building management, and recovering of heat from server rooms undertaken under the energy saving plan.\n\nIn response to the appeal from the French government, a large-scale energy saving plan was launched in September 2022. The aim is to reach the target of 10% less consumption by 2024 relative to the base year (2019). Coordinated by an energy saving manager appointed at Group level and by energy saving advisors at each French facility, the plan focuses on several areas:\n\n- reducing electricity and gas consumption by following government guidance on heating and air conditioning,\n- optimizing the energy efficiency of systems and equipment such as technical aeration plants, compressors, datacenters and computer workstations,\n- switching from conventional lighting to LED lighting,\n- introducing technical energy management and technical building management as standard at all facilities,\n- producing renewable energy by installing photovoltaic panels at all facilities where this is technically feasible.\n\nCommunication was ramped up to facilitate buy-in and rally all employees behind these goals, both within the company and outside it.\n\nThe first results from this energy saving plan were noted in the consumption readings as of the end of 2022, as a result of the immediate implementation of organizational and behavioral measures. The first technical measures, including the widespread use of LED lighting and the introduction of technical energy management at certain facilities, were implemented in 2023, confirming the positive effects of this plan. The plan will reach its full potential by 2025 once photovoltaic panels and technical energy management is rolled out at all facilities.\n\n66% of other combustion energies are consumed by a single site following its relocation in 2022 to new premises, resulting in the use of heating oil. The remaining consumption is related to the use of diesel during operational testing of the sprinkler system motor pump units and during the operation of emergency generators.\n\nIn the context of new construction and renovation of buildings, energy and environmental performances are systematically sought in the interests of economic balance. New building designs factor in the requirements of the applicable French thermal regulations.\n\nSeveral of the Dassault Aviation Group's activities require aircraft fuel consumption, in both the civil and military sectors (ground and flight tests as part of new programs, end of production tests, ferry flights, demonstrations, pilot training, commercial flights). Consumptions varied depending on these activities in 2023 but they all contributed to an overall reduction in kerosene consumption. Conversely, SAF consumption increased, underlining the Group's commitment to working to decarbonize the sector of activity.\n\n### **Water consumption**\n\nTo date, all of the Dassault Aviation's facilities as well as those of its subsidiaries have access to a sufficient quantity and quality of water. Most water comes from public water supply networks, and to a lesser extent from groundwater pumping (nearly 5% in 2023). Most water is used for non-industrial purposes.\n\nIn 2023, water consumption was down by more than 10% on a like-for-like basis relative to 2019. This was due to the introduction of remote working, a partial move away from irrigating green spaces, the installation of flow restrictors in toilets and the fixing of leaks.\n\nAccording to the WRI's (World Research Institute*)* Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, four facilities are located in high risk or extremely high risk zones. The consumption of facilities in these zones at risk of water stress represent 7% of the Group's water supply.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/110/Figure/3 description: This image is a donut chart titled \"Water supply\". The chart shows the following data: (0-1) Low: 52%, (1-2) Low - Medium: 40%, (2-3) Medium - High: 6%, (3-4) High: 1%, (4-5) Extremely High: 1%.\n\nThe main objective over the next few years is to maintain the current level of water consumption, since most of the savings were achieved in the past (consumption of more than 700,000 m3 before the 2000s for the Parent Company alone and stable at the Group level since 2011 at around 200,000 m3). Particular attention will nevertheless be paid to water management in high risk zones.\n\n### **Raw materials**\n\nAluminum, titanium, steel and composites are the materials most widely used for the manufacturing of our products. By weight, aluminum is the predominant material used in the structure of our aircraft. For example, it accounts for more than 75% of the structural weight of a Falcon 8X. Dassault Aviation works with suppliers that are part of the sector's efforts to promote the increasing integration of recycled raw materials.\n\nThe search for a reduction in raw material consumption is a permanent objective, which includes:\n\n- the development of new technologies, such as composite or direct plastic and metal fabrication, which consumes less raw material. The Group's main direct metal fabrication unit is now fully operational at the Argonay facility,\n- the use of centralized platforms to regulate raw material volumes consumed,\n- selective sorting of scrap metal and composites, and returning them to the raw materials value chain, according to circular economy principles. A recycling process for composite by-products was set up in 2022 with the participation of Dassault Aviation.\n\nPaper consumption was down 35% compared with 2019, and stable compared with 2022, a testament to the sustainability of dematerialization efforts made during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n### **Chemicals**\n\nFor several years, actions aimed at limiting the use of hazardous chemicals have been carried out for CMR products (Carcinogens, Mutagens, Reprotoxics) subject to the REACH regulation (chromates, nonylphenols, siloxanes, terphenyls, etc.).\n\nThe modernization of the machinery fleet and the changes in processes contribute to the optimization of the quantities of chemicals used.\n\nThis optimization involves the qualification and deployment of alternative processes such as: replacement of chemical machining by mechanical machining, removal of chromates in surface treatment processes (Anodic Chromic Oxidation replaced by Anodic Sulfuric Oxidation, stripping without chrome VI), substitution of chromated paint primers and removal of octylphenols from sealants.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have taken future REACh regulations into account in our Company strategy: terphenyls in sealants, bisphenol A in epoxy resins, lead in electronics, PFAS restriction proposals which could have a major impact across all business sectors. As part of the European Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the recasting of chemicals regulations (REACH, F-GAS, ODS, etc.) are also being monitored.\n\nA Chemical Product Unit has been in place for more than ten years to advise on new products used in production or maintenance. This makes it possible to select, early on, the least hazardous chemicals for our industrial processes and to anticipate regulations so as to avoid the risks of obsolescence in the long term.\n\nSince 2013, 494 hazardous products have been removed, replaced or are being substituted.\n\nAt the same time, Dassault Aviation informs its customers about the presence of hazardous substances in aircraft via REACH – Article 33 declarations and maintenance manuals that specify the substances contained in certain aircraft components (chromates, lead, cadmium, bisphenol A, terphenyl, etc.). The potential risk during specific operations is thus identified, allowing the appropriate measures to be taken depending on local regulations.\n\n### **Wastewater**\n\nThe production sites likely to generate industrial wastewater are equipped with detoxification stations or wastewater treatment installations of the \"zero liquid discharge\" type. For heavy metals, these installations have discharge rates lower than the value limits set by the regulations.\n\nOut of all the sites involved in the monitoring of the Release of Hazardous Substances in Water (RSDE), only Mérignac is subject to continuous regulatory monitoring.\n\n### **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other atmospheric releases (excluding GHGs)**\n\nProduction activities require the implementation of chemical products, including solvent-based paints and cleaning products that emit VOCs. These VOC emissions are monitored under solvent management and facility emission control plans.\n\nThe more than 40% decrease in emissions compared with 2019 is the result of using products containing fewer solvents and efforts to prevent their evaporation.\n\n### **Fight against food waste and insecurity**\n\nThe Group has not identified any challenges for this issue.\n\n### **Waste**\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year saw a major increase in the production of non-hazardous waste, compared with 2022, but the production of this waste is stable compared with 2019, in line with objectives. This mainly included metal waste generated by the machining activity at the Secline site, which is growing rapidly in line with the Company's planned ramp-up.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Development of the circular economy**\n\n| Themes                                                                                |                                   | 2023<br>targets<br>(Ref:<br>2019) | 2023 | 2022 | Group performance<br>Like-for-like<br>change<br>since 2019* |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Developing the circular<br>economy,<br>in particular through the<br>recovery of waste | % recovery<br>total waste         | 80.0                              | 85.5 | 86.0 | 9.0                                                         |\n|                                                                                       | % recovery<br>non-hazardous waste | 90.0                              | 91.7 | 90.7 | 5.5                                                         |\n|                                                                                       | % recovery<br>hazardous waste     | 50.0                              | 60.6 | 65.4 | 10.1                                                        |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\nAccording to the principles of the circular economy, sites identify their hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams and seek the most suitable recovery and disposal solutions for their local environment, such as new recycling channels for furniture, sorting densification and landfill limitation.\n\nThe increasing integration of composite materials in aircraft provides significant weight saving, which means a reduction in CO<sup>2</sup> emissions during the operational phase. A share of production residues generated by these new activities are now considered as by-products and reused as raw materials in a dedicated branch set up in 2022.\n\nFive main processes are used for the end-of-life of our by-products and waste:\n\n- recycling of by-products, notably for composites,\n- reuse, mainly through collections set up with furnishing, electric and electronic eco-organizations,\n- recycling of metal, paper, cardboard and plastics,\n- energy recovery, the main sector for hazardous waste and mixed non-hazardous industrial waste,\n- bio-waste recovery.\n\n### **4.7.3. Keeping industrial accident risks to a minimum**\n\nIn order to prevent accidental pollution, the sites are equipped with oil separators, fitted dumping areas and containment basins for fire-extinguishing water.\n\nSites located over water tables have instituted monitoring of the water quality (piezometer) when their activities so require.\n\nEach site has a collection area specifically designed for the storage of its waste to avoid accidental pollution.\n\nSoil pollution diagnostics are carried out prior to civil engineering works or when land or buildings are sold. If historical pollution is identified, technical solutions are put in place to render the soil compatible with the intended use.\n\nThe risks of fire and explosion are assessed in each facility, and are covered by action plans to minimize them. The actions carried out as part of these plans include risk segregation, automatic fire detection and protection, and organizational measures.\n\nThe Group's French industrial sites are subject to ICPE (Classified Installations for the Protection of Environment) legislation. They hold the required administrative authorizations and none are classified as SEVESO.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.7.4. Strengthening the company's low-carbon plan in response to climate change**\n\nTackling climate change is a priority for the Company's CSR policy. GHG emissions reduction targets are set over three-year periods.\n\nTo align those targets with the 2050 trajectory, in 2021 Dassault Aviation worked with an expert company in this field. Accessible climate scenarios and an associated climate transition plan are currently being drawn up while measures have already been launched, as described in the previous sections.\n\nIn 2023, a Corporate Social Responsibility performance indicator was defined and is included in the corporate governance report. The low-carbon plan is one element of this indicator.\n\n| Themes                      |                        | 2024 targets<br>(Ref. 2019) | 2023<br>(TCO2eq.) | 2022<br>(TCO2eq.) | Like-for-like<br>change since<br>2019* |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Control<br>GHG<br>emissions | Scope 1 Non-kerosene   | -8%                         | 18,516            | 21,030            | -14.7%                                 |\n|                             | Scope 1 Kerosene + SAF | NA                          | 27,186            | 34,057            | -27.8%                                 |\n|                             | Scope 2                | -8%                         | 18,706            | 18,643            | -26.2%                                 |\n\n\\*The subsidiaries DABS and ExecuJet have only been consolidated since 2020, so there is no reference data for 2019.\n\n### **Scope 1 and 2 emissions**\n\nThe greenhouse gases taken into account are those covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Their emissions are expressed in metric tons of CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent. Emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are derived for scope 1 from direct emissions from the Group's air activity, combustion plants, the use of company vehicles and refrigerant leaks.\n\nYear on year, scope 1 emissions are down due to the reduction in industrial energy consumption resulting from the launch of the energy saving plan and the implementation of the first phase of the SAF plan.\n\nDassault Aviation has decided to speed up the replacement of its fleet of company and service vehicles above and beyond the regulatory requirements laid down in the French Mobility Orientation Law (Loi sur l'Orientation des Mobilités). The fleet, historically composed of diesel and gasoline vehicles, is thus transitioning toward hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nAt the end of 2023, low-emission electric and hybrid vehicles accounted for 43% of the Company's car fleet, representing an increase of 20% compared to the previous year.\n\nIn parallel with the replacement of the vehicle fleet, more than 360 charging points were also installed during 2023.\n\nEmissions associated with kerosene combustion are directly related to our aircraft activity. The Group's SAF plan implemented since July 2022 (see Section 4.7.1) continues and has been extended, contributing to the mitigation of these emissions. A total of 413 flights were operated with SAF in 2023; representing a reduction of 681 TCO2eq., i.e., an increase of 169% compared with 2022.\n\nAs in previous years, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions reports required for the Emissions Trading Scheme were produced for the Group's aviation business in France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nScope 2 emissions from electricity consumption were stable in 2023.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, the last GHG assessments and energy audits were carried out at eligible sites in France at the end of 2023.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Corporate Social Responsibility performance indicator\n\nThis indicator covers the Parent Company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions excluding kerosene, expressed as a function of worked hours and reference meteorological conditions. In 2022, carbon emissions within this scope were 15,144 T. In 2023, these emissions were 14,055 T representing a decrease of 7.2%.\n\n### **Scope 3 indirect emissions**\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Dassault Aviation carried out studies in collaboration with a firm of experts to identify decarbonization opportunities for its indirect emissions that could contribute to its low-carbon strategy. In 2023, work continued with all Executive Management teams to build the foundations of the climate transition plan.\n\n#### Purchases of products and services\n\nThis category was quantified using the methodology developed by the IAEG (International Aerospace Environmental Group) as part of the low-carbon plan.\n\nInitiatives have also been launched to raise the awareness of the supply chain to climate and environmental issues, including through specific contractual clauses and a supplier approval process incorporating environmental aspects.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to a commitment charter on relations between customers and suppliers in the aviation industry. As such, the company contributes to the work led by GIFAS (French Aerospace Industries Group) to rally the industry behind the shared goals of reducing the carbon footprint of aviation.\n\nDassault Aviation is involved in IAEG Working Group 11 (WG11), which is tasked with rolling out ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards within the aviation supply chain. One of the missions of this group was to select a platform capable of assessing and sharing information on supplier practices and which includes a carbon component. The EcoVadis platform is thus currently being rolled out within the aviation sector. Dassault System is studying the possibility of integrating this platform into its current assessment process.\n\n### Upstream and downstream freight transport\n\nLogistics platforms contribute to the optimization of transport flows and the associated CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. Environmental criteria, mainly relating to greenhouse gas emissions and the climate transition, were tightened in the Parent Company's invitation to tender for transport services when it was last revised at the end of 2023.\n\nMoreover, discussions took place in 2023 with innovative companies to consider groundbreaking transport solutions, notably transatlantic freight transit by sail.\n\n#### Business travel\n\nTravel remains below 2019 levels. The intensive use of collaborative tools and videoconferencing is contributing to this decline.\n\nThe Parent Company's travel policy encourages the use of trains for journeys of less than three hours. Under the terms of vehicle rental agreements for business trips, electric vehicles must be provided\n\nwherever possible, which at the Parent Company level resulted in an increase from less than 1% of journeys using electric vehicles in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023.\n\n#### Use of Falcon products sold\n\nThe reduction in fuel consumption and the corresponding carbon footprint is a historic concern of Dassault Aviation. Falcon aircraft are recognized as being among the least-emitting aircraft on the market with an equivalent range. To go further, many actions are being taken both in the technical and operational fields and in alternative fuels (see Section 4.7.1).\n\nModeling studies of emissions from Falcon aircraft delivered during the year are ongoing, according to the \"GHG Protocol\" method, taking into account the ramp-up of the SAF. Indeed, given the significant potential for reducing the carbon emissions of these fuels, the progressive use of the different\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\ngenerations of SAF in the air activity of business aviation makes it possible to consider a significant reduction of the carbon footprint over the aircraft lifetime.\n\n#### Travel to and from work\n\nThe employee mobility survey conducted during the first quarter of 2022 provided input for the Quality of Life and Working Conditions agreement signed on February 14, 2023 and which now includes a sustainable mobility component.\n\nSeveral measures implemented under this agreement help mitigate carbon emissions. For example, the formalization of remote working, on a regular basis or exceptionally when necessary, as well as the promotion of three virtuous modes of transport: bicycle, carpooling and low-emission vehicles, while continuing to encourage the use of public transport.\n\n### Impacts of climate change\n\nWork to identify physical risks related to climate change adaptation was undertaken by the Group. The aim of this work is to identify whether the sites of the Dassault Aviation Group, its subsidiaries and its supply chain are exposed to climate risk either currently or in the medium and long term using climate modeling scenarios.\n\nActions to reduce the environmental footprint of the Group's products and activities help mitigate the transition risks linked to climate change described in Chapter 2 \"Risk factors\", particularly market risks.\n\nThese elements are the input data for our transition plan.\n\n### **4.7.5. European Green Taxonomy**\n\n### **Regulatory context**\n\nTo promote transparency and a long-term vision of economic activities and to direct capital flows toward sustainable investments, the European Union has created a common classification system for business activities to identify economic activities considered sustainable. This system is defined in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the \"Taxonomy Regulation\") and is applicable since publication on the 2021 financial statements.\n\nTo determine whether an activity can be considered sustainable (aligned), it must:\n\n- Contribute substantially to one or more of the following environmental objectives:\n\t- climate change mitigation,\n\t- climate change adaptation,\n\t- the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\n\t- the transition to a circular economy,\n\t- pollution prevention and control,\n\t- the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- Comply with technical screening criteria established by the Commission,\n- Not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives,\n- Be carried out in compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights (minimum social safeguards).\n\nCompanies must disclose the share of their net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure associated with \"eligible\" (i.e. classified in the European Taxonomy) and \"aligned\" or \"sustainable\" economic activities (according to the rules listed above).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe publication of new Delegated Regulations 2023/2485 and 2023/2486 in November 2023 make new economic activities, including aviation activities, eligible for the six environmental objectives. These activities are set out in Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 and only meet the objective of mitigating climate change. For the 2023 fiscal year (2024 publication), only eligibility must be published for these new activities which were added in 2023.\n\n#### **Scope of analysis**\n\nThe net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure considered cover all the activities of the Dassault Aviation Group and correspond to the scope of consolidation of the financial statements defined in Note 2 of the 2023 consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs a result, the ratio calculations presented below do not take into account the entities over which the Dassault Aviation Group has joint control or significant influence, in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021.\n\n#### **Eligible and aligned activities under the taxonomy**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has reviewed its activities in all sectors defined:\n\n- in Annexes I and II of the supplementary Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, including its amended version following the publication of Delegated Regulation 2023/2485\n- in Annexes I to IV of Delegated Regulation 2023/2486 relating to the four environmental objectives.\n\nThe addition of aviation in Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 classes Dassault Aviation Group's main activity as eligible for the objective of mitigating climate change.\n\nThe analysis of the eligibility and alignment of CapEx and OpEx also focused on \"individual measures\" (i.e., other than those related to aviation), enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to achieve greenhouse gas reductions, as defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. Nevertheless, the share of expenses related to these activities is deemed non material.\n\nAs a result, all net sales, CapEx and OpEx are attributed to the aircraft manufacturing activity and are therefore 100% eligible.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturing activity will be included in the acts published in 2023 and is not subject to alignment criteria for the current fiscal year.\n\n### **Procedures for determining eligibility and alignment ratios**\n\nThe financial ratios were defined in accordance with the definitions given in Annex I to the Delegated Act of July 6, 2021.\n\nWith regard to net sales:\n\n as the aviation Delegated Act has been published, all net sales are declared as eligible under the \"3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft\" activity (cf. Note 15 to the Consolidated company financial statements).\n\nWith regard to capital expenditure (CapEx):\n\n- The denominator is taken directly from the Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements (after elimination of intra-group transactions). The scope covered corresponds to the entire scope of the consolidated financial statements, excluding associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. Capital expenditure includes inflows of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the fiscal year under review, before depreciation, amortization and revaluation, and inflows of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from business combinations.\n- The numerator is equal to total capital expenditure included in the denominator as related to assets associated with the eligible activity.\n\nIn total, eligible CapEx is valued at EUR 440 million and represents 100% of Group CapEx (see Note 4 to the consolidated company financial statements).\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to operating expenditure (OpEx):\n\n- The denominator is taken directly from the Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements (after elimination of intra-group transactions). The scope covered corresponds to the entire scope of the consolidated financial statements, excluding associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The denominator covers direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n- in terms of the numerator, it is equal to the total expenditure listed in the denominator as related to the eligible activity. However, this expenditure is insignificant (10%) in relation to the Group's overall operating expenditure (see consolidated income statement). Consequently, the Group considers that the eligible OpEx is not material for its business model and its business sector<sup>1</sup>.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Pursuant to Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 of July 6, 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Financial<br>year N                                                                                                                  | Economic<br>Activities<br>(1) | Code<br>(2) | Turn-<br>over<br>(3) | Propor-<br>tion of<br>Turn-<br>over<br>(4) | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (5) | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (6)     | Water (7) | Pollution (8) | Circular Economy<br>(9) | Biodiversity (10) | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (11)                | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (12) | Water (13) | Pollution (14) | Circular Economy<br>(15) | Biodiversity (16) | Minimum Safeguards<br>(17) | Proportion<br>of<br>Taxonomy<br>aligned<br>(A.1.) or<br>eligible<br>(A.2.)<br>Turnover,<br>year N-1<br>(18) | Category<br>enabling<br>activity<br>(19) | Category<br>transitional<br>activity<br>(20) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                      |                               | 2023        |                      |                                            |                                  | Substantial Contribution<br>Criteria |           |               |                         |                   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not<br>Significantly Harm') |                                   |            |                |                          |                   |                            |                                                                                                             |                                          |                                              |\n| A.

However, these expenditures appear insignificant (<10%) compared to all of the Group's operating expenses (see Consolidated income statement). Consequently, the Group considers that the eligible OpEx are immaterial with respect to its business model and its sector of activity. By convention, these eligible Opex were declared in line B – *Non-eligible activities*.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Level of eligibility and alignment of indicators by environmental objective in 2023**\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.7.6. Biodiversity**\n\nPreservation of biodiversity is taken into account when challenges require it. Accordingly, whenever new buildings are constructed at the Group's facilities, action is taken to avoid and mitigate any impacts on biodiversity.\n\nWhere avoidance and mitigation are insufficient, environmental offsetting measures are used, such as reforestation or restoration of wetlands and habitats of protected species.\n\nDassault Aviation does not however limit its commitment to controlling the impact of its new buildings on biodiversity. Dassault Aviation is thus a Patron of Maubuisson forest (Val d'Oise, Ile-de-France region). The Maubuisson project is unprecedented in the Ile-de-France region, with the planting of a million trees of 30 different species. This 1,340 ha of forest will benefit a population of 100,000 people in seven neighboring communities as well as the 12 million inhabitants of the Ile-de-France region.\n\n### **4.7.7. Respect for animal welfare and responsible food**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group's activities have no impact in these areas.\n\n### **4.8. Adopting a responsible approach**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/11 description: The image shows five icons representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. From left to right, the first icon is green and represents \"Good Health and Well-Being\". It features a white heart rate line. The second icon is maroon and represents \"Decent Work and Economic Growth\". It features a white bar graph with an upward trending arrow. The third icon is orange and represents \"Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\". It features a white geometric structure. The fourth icon is gold and represents \"Responsible Consumption and Production\". It features a white infinity symbol with an arrow. The fifth icon is blue and represents \"Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions\". It features a white dove holding an olive branch above a gavel.\n\n### **4.8.1. Safety culture**\n\n### **Airworthiness and Safety**\n\nThe Group works closely with the French and international airworthiness authorities, both civil and military. It has set up an organization to meet airworthiness requirements in design, production, maintenance and training for civil (PART 21, PART or FAR 145) and military (EMAR 21-G and EMAR/FR 145) aircraft.\n\nThe Group is regularly audited by the authorities (the French Department of Civil Aviation, the French Defense Procurement Agency, etc.), which verify compliance with the regulations on design, production and testing, maintenance, and safety management.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to improve the safety of its civil and military aircraft, Dassault Aviation has introduced a Safety Management System (SMS) based on ICAO recommendations, covering the entire aircraft life cycle.\n\nAn Executive Aviation Safety Officer coordinates the Safety Management System, promotes the safety culture and provides an independent assessment of all flight safety issues for civil and military aircraft and related activities for the entire Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe SMS was implemented by DFJ and DRAL in 2022. This roll-out continued in 2023 in the MRO subsidiaries of the Parent Company.\n\nMoreover, the Parent Company strives to promote the SMS culture at the suppliers of its supply chain.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Safety and Security**\n\nThe Safety/Security organization within the Company is structured around three areas:\n\n- Defense and Industry Security aimed at protecting the Company's assets (tangible and intangible), natural persons (employees) and legal persons (image, reputation).\n- Information System Security (ISS), relating to the protection of digital assets, IT systems, personal data and intellectual property rights.\n- Product Safety, covering protection with regard to aircraft safety, continuity of flight operations, operational maintenance of aircraft, continuity of service to Falcon passengers and the property of product users, such as personal data.\n\nFor each area, an officer from the Parent Company is appointed to oversee the activities.\n\n#### **4.8.2. Military aircraft production and export policy**\n\nDassault Aviation designs, manufactures, sells and supports military aircraft: Rafale, Mirage, ATL2, multi-mission Falcon.\n\nLinked to the government's foreign and defense policy, the production and export of war materiel are activities:\n\n- strictly regulated by French laws (since the Second World War),\n- carried out in accordance with European and international commitments entered into by France.\n\nCompanies involved in the manufacture or sale of war materiel may not do business unless they have authorization from the State and are under its control.\n\nIn the interests of sovereignty, the State has granted authorization to Dassault Aviation for the manufacture and sale of military aircraft. It also grants it export licenses through a robust and strictly enforced procedure.\n\nOn that basis, Dassault Aviation:\n\n- has a manufacturing and trade authorization granted by the French Ministry of Armed Forces for a maximum period of five years; the authorization is renewable, if necessary following investigation by the police, gendarmerie and prefecture in the areas where its plants are located,\n- cooperates with regular site inspections and document checks carried out by officials from the relevant ministries,\n- includes on its Board of Directors a government commissioner appointed by order of the French Ministry of Armed Forces,\n- carries out its design and production under the supervision and/or project management of the DGA (Direction générale de l'armement du ministère des Armées – French Defense Procurement Agency).\n\nFor exports of war materiel in particular, two general principles apply in France:\n\n- principle of prohibition: arms exports are prohibited, unless an exemption is granted by the State and subject to its control (there is no freedom of enterprise or trade in this respect); the exemption is applied by granting export licenses for war materiel;\n- principle of interministerial coordination: the Prime Minister bears ultimate responsibility for export controls.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nBy law, the State is responsible for the evaluation of France's military customers via a strict authorization process overseen by three regulatory bodies:\n\n- the CIEEMG (Commission interministérielle pour l'étude de l'exportation des matériels de guerre Interministerial Commission for Scrutiny of War Materiel Exports); the interministerial aspect ensures that export license applications undergo proper scrutiny5;\n- the SGDSN;\n- the DGA.\n\nThe provisions of Articles L. 2335-1 et seq. of the French Defense Code define the legal framework for authorization.\n\nExport transactions are examined retrospectively to ensure that they comply with the authorization granted by the CIEEMG. This procedure, which contributes to the robustness of the scrutiny process, includes manufacturers' compliance with any conditions imposed when the export license was issued.\n\nConsequently, the selection and evaluation of military customers, as well as the export of military aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (with the associated after-sales support), are subject to the strict supervision of the French authorities. They have the sovereign power to decide in which countries and under what conditions Dassault Aviation is authorized to enter into a contract with a military customer of the State.\n\nInterestingly, the Rafale aircraft of the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy contribute to the French nuclear deterrence policy through their ability to deploy the ASMP-A nuclear missile. This capability and this missile cannot be exported, in compliance with France's non-proliferation commitments.\n\nThe French Parliament is kept regularly informed of the activities of defense companies during parliamentary debates and through the publication of an annual report that addresses the need for transparency. The French Senate and National Assembly also hold select committee hearings at which defense company executives are asked questions. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation attends such hearings several times a year.\n\n### **4.8.3. Upgrading our approach to sustainable procurement**\n\nDue to the specific features of its sector of activity, and in accordance with its purchasing policy, Dassault Aviation is committed to sustainability processes in the choice of its partners.\n\nIn the framework of its industrial and purchasing activities, the Dassault Aviation Group:\n\n- supplies, manufactures and integrates all the constituent elements of its aircraft,\n- builds the interior fittings of Falcon business jets according to its customers' requirements,\n- controls its supply chain,\n\n- installs replacement and maintenance equipment that ensures the best service for customers,\n- ensures the operational availability of the aircraft.\n\nThese activities are based on an extensive supply chain with a strong national component, with a significant economic and social impact at the territorial level.\n\n<sup>5</sup> The CIEEMG examines applications for export and transfer licenses from manufacturers. The Commission, chaired by the SGDSN (Secrétariat général de la défense et de la sécurité nationale – Secretariat-General for Defense and National Security), brings together representatives of the French Minister for Defense, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for the Economy. Where appropriate, favorable opinions expressed by the CIEEMG may be accompanied by conditions, as well as the requirement for a non-re-export clause and an end-use certificate. The Prime Minister's decision, taken on the advice of the CIEEMG, is notified to Customs, which then issues any approved licenses.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises**\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an economic crisis, Dassault Aviation:\n\n- is involved, under the aegis of GIFAS, in monitoring the actions implemented within the framework of the \"Charter of commitment on customer and supplier relations within the French aeronautics sector,\"\n- is continuing to support its suppliers, focusing on financial aspects such as reducing payment times and taking into account - on a case-by-case basis - measures adapted to energy price changes.\n\nFor several decades, the Dassault Aviation Group has worked with and supported a broad network of aerospace companies and contributes to the evolution of many SMEs. The very nature of Dassault Aviation's products and the related services entails a long-term relationship with its suppliers.\n\nActive participation in professional bodies such as GIFAS and CIDEF allows Dassault Aviation to support SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the French aerospace supply chain in their plans to improve competitiveness and reduce their environmental footprint, etc.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to the SME Defense Pact membership agreement with the French Ministry of the Armed Forces. The Group is involved in the updating of this agreement, underlining its commitment to advancing French SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the Defense sector, and to strengthening good business practices.\n\nDassault Aviation also contributes to the ACE Aéro Partenaires investment fund. This fund aims to support SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in the aviation industry. In the prospective countries, Dassault Aviation involves SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises in cooperation and offsets.\n\n### **Purchasing policy**\n\nDassault Aviation's purchasing policy is designed to secure the Group's supply chain by improving the structural assessment of suppliers. This assessment is performed when referencing or monitoring a supplier to ensure that it is maintained in compliance with the guidelines. Structural risks are now taken into consideration in the Purchasing Policy.\n\nThe supplier approval procedure has been in place since 2007. It has been changed to include the provisions relating to the \"Sapin 2\" and \"Duty of Care\" laws, as well as cyber-security challenges.\n\nTo allow the referencing of a supplier, a structural assessment consists of five components:\n\n- Financial health,\n- Security,\n- Cyber-security,\n- Management of health, safety in the workplace, the environment and chemical products,\n- Compliance (anti-corruption, human rights and fundamental freedoms).\n\nSupplier monitoring, which takes into account these same themes, is performed regularly through semiannual campaigns, or when a significant event occurs.\n\nFor example, Dassault Aviation carried out almost 500 structural analyses of 100% of new suppliers approved in 2023.\n\nThe collaborative work with suppliers is based on the deployment of the \"BoostAeroSpace/Air Supply\" digital platform, which is the aviation industry standard. Dassault Aviation is reinforcing this approach with the commitments set out in the recovery plan and the Supplier Charter.\n\nDassault Aviation pays particular attention to the management and performance of its supply chain particularly through the supply chain committee, which defines the strategy in this area.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Volume of purchases**\n\nIn 2023, the order commitments of the Dassault Aviation Group were in the region of EUR 4.4 billion. France accounts for almost 80% of purchases.\n\n### **4.8.4. Territorial influence**\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has a significant French and international territorial network:\n\n- Dassault Aviation: nine sites in France,\n- Dassault Falcon Service: two sites in France,\n- Sogitec: two sites in France,\n- Dassault Falcon Jet and its subsidiaries: five sites, four in the United States, and one in Brazil,\n- Dassault Aviation Business Services: four sites in Europe,\n- ExecuJet MRO Services: nine main sites, one in South Africa, two in Belgium, one in Malaysia, one in the United Arab Emirates and four in Australia/New Zealand,\n- Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited: one site in India.\n\nThe Falcon maintenance subsidiaries also have several international technical divisions which are not listed because their size does not warrant it.\n\nAll these entities rely on a large number of suppliers who contribute to the local economy.\n\nDassault Aviation is a certified Approved Economic Operator.\n\nThe Group actively participates in local bodies, competitiveness clusters and regional professional bodies:\n\n- In France: Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Territorial Economic and Social Councils, Environment Committees, Aerospace Valley, SAFE in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, BAAS, Aérocampus, ESTIA campus, Agency for Development and Innovation (ADI), Alpha Route des Lasers (Alpha RLH), Bordeaux Technowest, PDIE and AEROTEAM in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region, ASTech in the Ile-de-France region and CESI (the Nanterre school of engineering in France).\n- In the United States: Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce, State of Arkansas Work-force Development, Delaware River Administration, and the Arkansas, Delaware and New Jersey Economic Advisory Committees.\n\n### **4.8.5. Inclusion, humanitarianism and culture**\n\nThrough sponsorship agreements and charitable actions, the Dassault Aviation Group supported various non-profit organizations and institutions in 2023, including: Hanvol, Elles bougent, la Fondation des Œuvres Sociales de l'Air, l'Association pour le Développement des Œuvres Sociales de la Marine, l'Association des Anciens de l'École Navale, l'École d'Enseignement Technique de l'Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace, le Syndicat Mixte d'Aménagement de la Plaine de Pierrelaye-Bessancourt, Aviation Sans Frontières, Rêves de Gosses, la Course du Cœur, la Fondation Foch, l'Ordre de la Libération, l'Association de la Flamme sous l'Arc de Triomphe, la Fondation des Ailes de France, l'Académie de l'Air et de l'Espace, la Fondation de l'Académie des Technologies, le Musée de la Marine, l'Association pour le Grand Prix de l'École Navale, Cultivate Women in Business, Women in Aviation, Habitat for Humanity, Arkansas Food Bank, American Red Cross, Muscular Dystrophy Association.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4.8.6. Duty of care**\n\nWith its Code of Ethics and decision to support the UN Global Compact in 2003, Dassault Aviation affirmed its commitment in this area very early on.\n\nA system for assessing the risks at Group level (see Section 3.3 Risk management procedures) identifies the main risks and manages their potential consequences for the company and its stakeholders.\n\nIn parallel with this system, a Group-wide vigilance plan was drawn up in 2017 to assess the risks of serious breaches in the areas of the environment, occupational health and safety, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The plan covers all suppliers with whom the Group has an established business relationship.\n\n### **General framework**\n\nThrough its organization and internal processes (Human Resources, CSR, Ethics and Compliance, etc.), Dassault Aviation takes into account the risks generated by its activities and services that come under its duty of care.\n\nThe risks of serious breaches directly related to the Group's activities are addressed by the Company Risk Committee.\n\nAn evaluation and monitoring mechanism for production sub-contractors, which was extended to Europe and India in 2019 and covers environmental and occupational health and safety risks, is also in place. Since then, 261 production sub-contractors have been evaluated, with 35 identified as being at risk. Those sub-contractors have undergone surveillance audits and taken part in awareness-raising.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the network of service centers were also evaluated on this basis.\n\n### **Specific framework supplementing the Duty of Care law**\n\nAn additional vigilance plan, in accordance with the requirements of Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of care, is in place to deal with the Group's supply chain and identify suppliers at potential risk.\n\nThe main components of this vigilance plan are:\n\n- risk mapping by country, taking into consideration environmental criteria, rights and freedoms of work, and health, safety and working conditions. It is based on global indicators published periodically by specialized organizations such as Yale University, UNICEF and ILO,\n- risk mapping by activity (industrial, tertiary, completion, infrastructure, etc.),\n- a risk assessment by supplier, incorporated into the approval and oversight process, based on standardized IAEG and GIFAS questionnaires and questionnaires specific to the company,\n- an onsite evaluation process that may result in an audit for high-risk subsidiaries and suppliers,\n- a mechanism for the internal reporting of potentially risky situations detected among suppliers that gives anyone outside the Company an additional opportunity to use one of the existing means of communication to submit any reports. This is part of the Company's whistleblowing procedure,\n- a \"vigilance\" commission which examines aggregated reports.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Themes                                                              | Group performance                                                      |                                                       |            |            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                     |                                                                        | Objective                                             | 2023       | 2022       |\n|                                                                     | Number of suppliers processed                                          | All suppliers in the process of approval or follow-up | 397 (100%) | 533 (100%) |\n| Anticipate supplier risks, especially for sub-contracted activities | % of suppliers with a high-risk location or business                   | -                                                     | 15%        | 20%        |\n|                                                                     | % of progress in the assessments of production sub-contractors at risk | 100%                                                  | 84%        | 87.5%      |\n|                                                                     | % of suppliers with a negative opinion                                 | -                                                     | 0.8%       | 0.6%       |\n| Anticipate the supplier risks of subsidiaries                       | Number of suppliers processed by subsidiaries                          | -                                                     | 385        | 240        |\n\nThe vigilance plan has been implemented within the main subsidiaries: Dassault Falcon Service, Sogitec and Dassault Falcon Jet.\n\nSince the scheme was introduced in 2018, the Group has not detected any supplier with an immediate significant risk. Nevertheless, among the assessments carried out, a few suppliers had weaknesses in one of the areas assessed. They are placed under supervision and action is taken (e.g. on-site audits) proportionate to the risk identified. Three audits were carried out in 2023.\n\nIn parallel, a campaign to raise buyers' awareness of CSR issues was carried out to enhance their contribution to risk management. This module, which is part of the Purchasing training course, has raised awareness among 121 buyers since 2021.\n\nThe Total Quality Management Department coordinates the vigilance plan and ensures the correct operation and effectiveness of the process in place. In 2021, an audit was conducted by the Internal Audit and Risks Department of Dassault Aviation on the Parent Company's compliance with Law 2017- 399 of March 27, 2017, governing the Duty of Care.\n\n#### **Conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold)**\n\nAlthough Dassault Aviation does not source directly, the Company is particularly vigilant about the origin of certain minerals (such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) used in its products, in accordance with US regulations derived from the Dodd-Frank Act and Regulation (EU) 2017/821.\n\nTo share information with its customers, Dassault Aviation has set up an organization to compile information from its supply chain on the provenance of such minerals. This topic is included in the supplier evaluation questionnaire during the accreditation stage. In addition, a CMRT (Conflict Minerals Reporting Template) has been collected annually since 2020, mainly from electronics suppliers likely to use these minerals in the manufacture of their components (386 suppliers questioned in 2023).\n\nWe also collected information on other controversial minerals (cobalt, mica) using the EMRT (Extended Minerals Reporting Template) and CRT (Cobalt Reporting Template).\n\nIn 2023, we received 465 supplier reports (294 CMRT and 171 EMRT or CRT). For 2024, the aim is to compile information on cobalt systematically and to expand the panel of suppliers targeted.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4.8.7. Respect for human rights**\n\nIn line with OECD Guidelines (updated in 2023), Dassault Aviation is committed to responsible business conduct for the respect of Human Rights.\n\nThe Group has introduced a comprehensive system to manage human rights-related risks: Code of Ethics, dedicated internal organization, due diligence and vigilance plan which details the measures put in place to prevent and mitigate the risks around human rights in compliance with international conventions and the French Duty of Care Law (Loi sur le Devoir de Vigilance) of March 27, 2017.\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group, whose main facilities are located in France and the United States, is committed to the respect of all national and international laws and regulations regarding human rights, especially as regards occupational health and safety of employees and non-discrimination in the workplace. It acts in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the provisions of the OECD and the International Labour Organization relating to Human Rights.\n\nDassault Aviation joined the UN Global Compact in 2003 and adopted the 10 principles, including the principle relating to Human Rights.\n\nThe Dassault Aviation Group has a Code of Ethics that reflects these commitments. This Charter is available on the Dassault Aviation website and on the Dassault Aviation Intranet; it is always distributed to new hires.\n\nThe Code also pays particular attention to respect for human rights and fundamental labor rights and to the proper application of essential principles:\n\n- non-discrimination on grounds of origin, morals, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political or religious opinions, trade union membership;\n- respect for the individual and his or her private life;\n- maintenance of a safe working environment and conditions (see Section 4.6).\n\nIn accordance with our General Purchasing Conditions, our suppliers and service providers undertake to comply with our Code of Ethics when they execute their orders.\n\nSince 2017, under our purchasing and supply chain security policy, the evaluation procedure for suppliers and sub-contractors has included criteria for evaluating respect for human rights. They are evaluated on the basis of a completed questionnaire, the answers to which will allow Dassault Aviation to decide whether to embark on a business relationship with them.\n\nLastly, the Ethics and Compliance Department handles any reports of violations of the law and international conventions on human rights, as part of its internal whistleblowing procedure.\n\n### **4.8.8. Preventing risks of corruption and upholding business ethics**\n\nIn strict compliance with the recommendations of the French Anti-Corruption Agency, the Group has introduced a system to address the risks of corruption with appropriate measures to prevent and detect, in France and abroad, acts of corruption or influence peddling in accordance with Law 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy.\n\nDassault Aviation has chosen to entrust an independent body, the Ethics and Compliance Department, with the implementation and supervision of the anti-corruption system. This department reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Within the Dassault Aviation Group and its subsidiaries, this department ensures that the Company fulfills its legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Strict business ethics**\n\nThrough its Code of Ethics, the Dassault Aviation Group asserts the values that serve to unite the actions of all its employees. This charter also sets out a code of conduct that the Group applies with its customers, partners, suppliers and sub-contractors. It is supplemented by an anti-corruption code and an anti-corruption guide describing real-life situations that employees might encounter.\n\nObserving a strict code of ethics, the Group commits to acting in accordance with the Convention of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Convention and national laws. The Parent Company takes part in the OECD's Annual Anti-Corruption and Integrity Forum.\n\nDassault Aviation is a signatory to numerous international commitments on the prevention of corruption (Global Compact, Common Industry Standards, Global Principles). It is also a member of several associations and forums on ethical business conduct and corporate responsibility at the national, European and international levels (see website www.dassault-aviation.com, Ethics section). Dassault Aviation is a member of the IFBEC (International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct) and adheres to the standards of the ASD (AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe) with a view to maintaining its anti-corruption system at the highest level.\n\n### **A training policy for all staff**\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department organizes specific training sessions for the managers and personnel most exposed to risks of corruption and influence peddling. The purpose of this training is to give staff the essential tools to detect potential risks and instruct them in the vigilance and behavior required in such situations.\n\nIn line with its 2022 action plan, the Ethics and Compliance Department trained 755 employees in 2023 through 21 sessions dedicated to the Sapin 2 program.\n\nThe content of each session is set in consultation with the Ethics and Compliance Department and the concerned department, with regard to mapping the risks of breaches of probity. These sessions must allow the fundamental principles of the Sapin 2 Law to be acquired based on concrete situations covered by the risk mapping scenarios.\n\nIn addition to longer training sessions for functions considered more at risk with regard to their specific nature (buyers and sellers for example), the Ethics and Compliance Department organizes awareness sessions for less exposed staff. These awareness sessions enable it to reach out to more employees on anti-corruption issues and related corporate policies.\n\nSessions covering other areas relating to business ethics have also been run by the Ethics and Compliance Department. This was the case in particular for sessions covering the GDPR and Duty of Care law. These compliance training sessions have also been proposed to the Group's subsidiaries and overseas offices.\n\nA Sapin 2 e-learning module aimed at all employees was launched during 2023 and has already been used to train 3,033 members of staff. This e-learning module was a fun way of validating the knowledge of all new Company employees.\n\n### **A robust compliance system**\n\nFor many years, the Dassault Aviation Group has implemented strict internal procedures to prevent corruption and ensure the integrity, business ethics and reputation of the Group in its industrial and commercial relations.\n\nPursuant to the law of December 9, 2016 concerning the fight against corruption, the Dassault Aviation Group supplemented and strengthened its process to prevent and detect corruption and influence peddling at the level of both the Parent Company and its subsidiaries under the leadership of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who promotes a zero-tolerance policy.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department is tasked with implementing and auditing procedures related to the fight against corruption and influence peddling. As a result, risk maps on the fight against corruption and influence peddling have been developed and deployed within the Group in consultation with the various operational units and are regularly updated. These risk maps are designed to identify, analyze\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nand prioritize the risks of the Group's exposure to corruption and influence peddling, taking into account internal processes, risks factors, the nature of the civil and military activities, and the geographical areas in which the company operates. These maps serve as the basis for the Group's compliance policy, which led the Dassault Aviation Group to strengthen existing anti-corruption procedures.\n\nIn addition to the Code of Ethics, an Anti-Corruption Code - specifically dedicated to the prevention and fight against corruption - had been updated. This Code defines and illustrates, using practical examples and scenarios, the different types of employee behavior to be proscribed as likely to constitute acts of bribery or influence peddling. It is integrated into the internal rules of Dassault Aviation's various sites. Any violation is therefore punishable.\n\nSince the \"Whistleblower\" law of March 21, 2022, the Internal Whistleblowing Procedure allowing employees and external contractors to report any breach of the Code of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Code has been extended to the reporting of any crime or offense, including human rights abuses. The Ethics and Compliance Department is responsible for receiving and processing internal whistleblowing reports. For this purpose, a dedicated email address with an encryption system guaranteeing confidentiality is available to all employees. In fiscal year 2023, no acts of corruption or influence peddling were brought to the attention of the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\nThe procedures for evaluating the situation of customers, suppliers, sub-contractors and consultants in the light of the risk map have been strengthened. Before the Dassault Aviation Group agrees to do business with them, special committees are tasked with going through the various stages to ensure that they comply with its business ethics.\n\nSpecial internal and external accounting control procedures intended to ensure that the books, ledgers and accounts do not mask acts of corruption or influence peddling are deployed within the Finance Department, thus reinforcing the existing procedures implemented by the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\nThroughout the 2023 fiscal year, the Ethics and Compliance Department performed level 2 controls:\n\n- of evaluation procedures for tier 1 suppliers and sub-contractors, civil aircraft customers and consultants,\n- of accounting procedures in association with the Financial Department,\n- and of gifts relating to the Communication Department.\n\nThese follow-up missions confirmed that evaluation procedures covering the Sapin 2 Law had been put in place and were working.\n\nThe compliance program deployed by Dassault Aviation and its subsidiaries demonstrates our commitment to effectively combating corruption and influence peddling.\n\nA page dedicated to the Ethics and Compliance Department is available on the Parent Company intranet site. This page outlines the company's policy on business ethics, provides details of contacts within the Ethics and Compliance Department, and gives a list of reference documents (in French and English), including the Anti-Corruption Code, the Anti-Corruption Guide and the Internal Whistleblowing Procedure.\n\nA page dedicated to ethics and compliance is also accessible on the Group's website.\n\n### **4.8.9. Promoting the Nation-Army bond**\n\nThe strong historical links between Dassault Aviation and the French Army are part of our Group's DNA. This is reflected in the commitment of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Éric Trappier, who served for several years as an officer of the French Navy's operational reserve and is currently Naval Captain of the French military reserve.\n\nDassault Aviation grants its reservist employees an annual leave of absence of 12 calendar days in respect of their deployment or training activities in the military operational reserve (the minimum legal period is 10 working days).\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nMoreover, in 2023, Dassault Aviation introduced the \"Dassault Defense Academy\" for new managerlevel recruitments: three days of training with high-level conferences and visits to military sites.\n\nFinally, Dassault Aviation is patron of several defense-related institutions and charities, including:\n\n- Ordre de la Libération,\n- Association de la Flamme sous l'Arc de Triomphe,\n- Fondation des Ailes de France,\n- Musée de la Marine,\n- Association pour le Grand Prix de l'École Navale.\n\n### **4.9. Complying with European, national and local regulations**\n\n### **Contribution to SDGs**\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/12 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background. In the upper left corner, there is a large white number \"9\" stacked on top of the words \"INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE\", also in white. Below the text, there is a white geometric design composed of three cubes connected to each other.\n\nThe main Group entities have regulatory oversight systems that make it possible to identify or anticipate the requirements applicable to their activities and carry out compliance actions when it is necessary.\n\nIn 2023, several major regulatory measures on climate change and sustainability were drafted and published:\n\n- delegated acts on the climate component of the European environmental Taxonomy, and on four other environmental objectives,\n- the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), along with the related ESRS,\n- the \"Fit for 55\" legislative package,\n- a new draft EU directive the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, etc.\n\nTo supplement the regulatory oversight systems put in place, Dassault Aviation participates in activities, studies and work carried out by aerospace organizations. This enables the Group to anticipate the regulations applicable to its activities.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5. DASSAULT AVIATION, Parent Company**\n\n### **5.1. Activities**\n\nThe activities of Dassault Aviation (Parent Company), particularly in the area of programs development, Research & Development, and production, have been presented to you within the framework of the Group's activities.\n\n### **5.2. Results**\n\n### **5.2.1. Order intake**\n\nParent Company order intake in 2023 was **EUR 6,734 million**, compared with EUR 17,860 million in 2022. Export order intake represented 61%.\n\nChanges were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|          | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Defense  | 5,717 | 15,377 | 8,955  |\n| Export   | 3,059 | 13,855 | 6,109  |\n| France   | 2,658 | 1,522  | 2,846  |\n| Falcon   | 1,017 | 2,483  | 2,119  |\n| Total    | 6,734 | 17,860 | 11,074 |\n| % Export | 61%   | 90%    | 73%    |\n\nThe order intake is composed entirely of firm orders.\n\n### **Defense programs**\n\nIn 2023, **Defense order intake** totaled **EUR 5,717 million** compared with EUR 15,377 million in 2022. The **Defense Export figure** was **EUR 3,059 million** in 2023, versus EUR 13,855 million in 2022. In 2022, 92 Rafale were ordered (80 by the United Arab Emirates, 6 by Greece and 6 by Indonesia) compared to 18 Rafale ordered by Indonesia in 2023.\n\nThe **Defense France** share amounted to **EUR 2,658 million** in 2023, compared with EUR 1,522 million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the order for Tranche 5 for 42 Rafale (in 2022, the order relating to Phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator was recorded.)\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Falcon programs**\n\nIn 2023, **24 Falcon orders** were recorded, compared with 63 in 2022. Order intake totaled **EUR 1,017 million**, versus EUR 2,483 million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to the decline in the number of Falcon ordered (24 vs. 63 in 2022).\n\n### **5.2.2. Net sales**\n\nNet sales in 2023 totaled **EUR 4,101 million**, versus EUR 6,305 million in 2022. Changes were as follows, in millions of euros:\n\n|          | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Defense  | 2917  | 4,778 | 5,042 |\n| Export   | 1516  | 3,607 | 4,369 |\n| France   | 1 401 | 1,171 | 673   |\n| Falcon   | 1 184 | 1,527 | 1,316 |\n| Total    | 4 101 | 6,305 | 6,358 |\n| % Export | 64%   | 81%   | 88%   |\n\n#### **Defense programs**\n\n**13 Rafale (11 France and 2 Export)** were delivered. 14 Rafale (13 Export and 1 France) were delivered in 2022.\n\n**Defense net sales** in 2023 were **EUR 2,917 million** versus EUR 4,778 million in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense Export** share was **EUR 1,516 million** versus EUR 3,607 million in 2022. This decrease is largely due to the delivery of 2 Rafale Export, whereas 13 Rafale Export were delivered in 2022.\n\nThe **Defense France** share was **EUR 1,401 million** versus EUR 1,171 million in 2022.

Shareholder information**\n\n### **5.5.1. Capital structure**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the share capital of the Company is EUR 64,641,892.80. It is divided into 80,802,366 shares, each with a par value of EUR 0.80.\n\nThe shares are listed on the regulated \"Euronext Paris\" market in Compartment A, International Securities Identification Number (ISIN): FR0014004L86. They are eligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (SRD). Following the increase in its free float, in 2016 Dassault Aviation joined the following stock market indices: Sociétés des Bourses Françaises 120 (SBF 120) and the Morgan Stanley Capital International World (MSCI World).\n\nPursuant to Law No. 2014-384 of March 29, 2014, seeking to reconquer the real economy, and since April 3, 2016, shares issued by the Company and held in a registered account for two years or more are entitled to double voting rights.\n\nThe Company's bylaws do not include any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or on the transfer of shares.\n\nSince the General Meeting of May 20, 2015, there has been a statutory obligation to provide information on the crossing of ownership thresholds. This applies to any fraction held that is equal to or greater than 1% of the capital and voting rights of the Company, and any multiple of that percentage, which exceeds or falls below those thresholds. A proposal will be made to the next General Meeting to amend this statutory clause to remove the obligation to declare the 1% crossing of ownership thresholds beyond 50%.\n\nNo shareholder has special control rights. In particular, there is no shareholding system offering employees specific control.\n\n| Shareholders        | Number of shares | %       | Exercisable voting<br>rights(2) | %       |\n|---------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| GIMD                | 51,960,760       | 64.31%  | 103,921,520                     | 79.26%  |\n| Float               | 18,786,539       | 23.25%  | 18,922,456                      | 14.43%  |\n| Airbus SE           | 8,275,290        | 10.24%  | 8,275,290                       | 6.31%   |\n| Treasury shares (1) | 1,779,777        | 2.20%   | 0                               | 0.00%   |\n| TOTAL               | 80,802,366       | 100.00% | 131,119,266                     | 100.00% |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the shareholding of Dassault Aviation is as follows:\n\n(1) shares recorded in the \"fully registered shares\" account, without voting rights.\n\n(2) Pursuant to the \"Florange\" Law, and in the absence of contrary provisions in the bylaws of Dassault Aviation, shares held in a registered account for more than two years are entitled to double voting rights.\n\nDirect or indirect shareholdings in the Company of which it is aware, pursuant to Articles L. 233- 7 and L. 233-12 of the French Commercial Code, are shown in the table above.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, 24,600 shares (0.03% of the capital) were held by one of the corporate investment funds whose members are current or former employees of the Company.\n\n### **5.5.2. Information on capital, shareholders and voting rights**\n\nThe General Meeting has not agreed to delegate any authority or powers to the Board of Directors regarding capital increases.\n\nThe Company has not issued any securities representative of its current capital.\n\nThe Company did not create any stock options in 2023.\n\nThe General Meeting of May 11, 2021 authorized the Board of Directors to allocate, in one or more stages, free existing shares of the Company (to the benefit of Company employees or certain employee categories it may determine, and to the benefit of eligible corporate officers of the Company).\n\nThis authorization, valid for a period of 38 months from the General Meeting, concerned a maximum of 278,000 shares (1) representing 0.33% of the capital as of May 11, 2021. It states that the Board of Directors shall determine the identity of the beneficiaries of such allocations and, as required, the conditions and the criteria for allocating the shares, as well as the vesting and lock-in period of those shares.\n\n(1) proforma, following the 10-for-1 stock split\n\nPursuant to this authorization (see Table 6 of the Report on Corporate Governance), on March 8, 2023 the Board of Directors decided to award 23,000 performance shares to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 16,900 performance shares to the Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThese shares will become vested (between 0% and 128%) provided the following performance criteria are met:\n\n- adjusted Group operating margin,\n- two aspects of corporate social responsibility, namely:\n\t- o feminization,\n\t- o the low-carbon plan,\n- qualitative assessment of individual performance.\n\nIn addition, the same Board Meeting defined the following other conditions:\n\n- a one-year vesting period, ending on March 7, 2024 (evening),\n- presence in the workforce at the end of the vesting period,\n- a one-year holding period for beneficiaries, starting from March 8, 2024, and ending March 7, 2025,\n- from March 8, 2025, the retention of 20% of those shares for the duration of their term of office.\n\nA proposal will be made to the next General Meeting to approve a new delegation of powers to the Board of Directors to allocate free existing shares of the Company (to the benefit of Company employees or certain employee categories it may determine, and to the benefit of eligible corporate officers of the Company).\n\n### **5.5.3. Securities transactions by corporate officers**\n\nThe securities transactions executed in 2023 by corporate officers consisted of the acquisition of performance shares voted by the Board of Directors on March 8, 2023 (see Report on Corporate Governance).\n\nNo other acquisition or sale of Dassault Aviation shares was declared by corporate officers to the Company or to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*). Such transactions, when they occur and subject to their amount, must be reported to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) and the Company, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 223-22-A et seq. of the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) General Regulation.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.5.4. Shareholders' agreements**\n\nThere is no shareholders' agreement between Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault (GIMD) and Airbus SE.\n\nHowever, the following two agreements are in place:\n\n### **Agreement between the French government, Airbus SE and Airbus SAS**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 233-11 of the French Commercial Code, the Company has been informed by the French Commissioner of State Holdings that on June 21, 2013, the French government signed a shareholders' agreement with Airbus SE and Airbus SAS that established concerted action with respect to Dassault Aviation. This agreement provides as follows:\n\n- Airbus may exercise its voting rights in General Meetings following consultation with the French government,\n- the French government is granted the right of first refusal and the right of first offer should Airbus seek to dispose of all or part of its shares in the stock of Dassault Aviation.\n\nAirbus SE, which also signed the agreement, is bound by these commitments.\n\n### **Agreement between the French Government and GIMD**\n\nIn application of Article L. 233-11 of the French Commercial Code, the Company was informed by GIMD that, on November 28, 2014, the French Government signed an agreement with GIMD, which would enter into force on December 2, 2014. The purpose of this agreement is to confer on the French Government preemptive rights in case of transfer of Dassault Aviation shares by GIMD that would drop below the 40% threshold in Dassault Aviation capital, and in case of any subsequent shares transfers below this threshold.\n\nThis agreement does not constitute a concerted action between the French government and GIMD, each remaining at total liberty to manage its shareholding and exercise its voting rights.\n\nThese two agreements have no impact on the Company's governance.\n\nGIMD holds the majority of the capital and voting rights in Dassault Aviation.\n\n### **5.5.5. Treasury shares**\n\n### **Share buyback programs**\n\nThe share buyback program voted by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and implemented by the Board of Directors on July 20, 2022 continued into the first half of 2023.\n\nTo allow Dassault Aviation to continue to trade its own shares on the market or off-market, the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 authorized a new share buyback program, identical to those implemented since 2014, under similar conditions to the 2022 program. At its meeting of May 16, 2023, the Board of Directors implemented the new share buyback program and delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to conduct any transaction under the conditions set by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis new authorization, valid for a period of 18 months as of May 16, 2023 (until November 15, 2024 inclusive), terminates, at this date, the share buyback program previously authorized by the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2022, for the unused portion of that program.\n\nThis share buyback program is in compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and European Regulation 596/2014 of April 16, 2014.\n\nThis share buyback authorization may be used by the Board of Directors for the following objectives:\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n- to cancel shares in order to increase the profitability of shareholders' equity and earnings per share,\n- to transfer or allocate shares to employees and corporate officers of the Company and/or of affiliated companies under the terms and conditions stipulated by law, particularly in case of the exercising of stock options or allocating existing free shares, or transferring and/or subscribing for existing shares as part as an employee stock ownership scheme,\n- to stimulate market activity or increase the liquidity of Dassault Aviation shares through an investment services provider under a liquidity contract compliant with an ethics charter recognized by the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers),\n- to retain the shares with a view to subsequent use, to remit them as payment or in exchange, including as part of any external growth transactions, for up to 5% of the share capital,\n- to remit the shares upon exercise of rights attached to debt securities convertible to Dassault Aviation shares,\n- to implement any market practice that would be recognized by the law or by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*).\n\nThe acquisition, disposal or transfer of shares as described above may be carried out by any means compatible with applicable law and regulations, including as part of a negotiated trade.\n\nThe authorization given by the General Meeting on May 16, 2023, to the Board of Directors entitles Dassault Aviation to buy its own shares, up to a limit of 10% of its capital, for a unit price capped at EUR 200 exclusive of acquisition costs (compared with EUR 170 in 2022), subject to adjustments linked to corporate actions, particularly through the incorporation of reserves and the allocation of free shares and/or stock split or reverse stock split.\n\nThe maximum amount to be used to buy back the Company's shares is EUR 1,661,559,000 based on the number of shares outstanding on the date of the decision; this condition is combined with the condition for a 10% cap on the Company's capital.\n\nThe General Meeting conferred all powers to the Board of Directors, with an option to subdelegate in the cases authorized by the law, to decide to act on this authorization, place any stock market or offmarket orders, sign any agreements, draw up any documents including information documents, set the terms for the Company's market or off-market dealings, as well as the terms and conditions for acquisition and disposal of shares, file any declarations, including to the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*), set the terms and conditions protecting, where necessary, the rights of the holders of securities giving access to the capital, of options to subscribe for or buy shares, or of rights to allocate performance shares in accordance with legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, fulfill any formalities and, in general, do whatever is necessary to complete such transactions.\n\nThe General Meeting also conferred all powers to the Board of Directors if the law or the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*) were to extend or add to the objectives authorized for the share buyback program, in order to bring to public attention, within applicable legal and regulatory terms and conditions, any amendments with regard to the program's objectives.\n\nThe buyback by Dassault Aviation of its own shares in 2023 related to:\n\n- 556,179 shares acquired between January 1, 2023 and May 16, 2023 under the share buyback program voted by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022,\n- 3,257,124 shares acquired between May 17, 2023 and December 31, 2023 under the program voted by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023,\n\nIn 2023, these 3,813,303 shares (4.72% of the share capital at December 31, 2023) were acquired at an average share price of EUR 173.16, or a cumulative gross amount of EUR 660,311,989. Trading fees amounted to EUR 462,218.\n\nTaking into account the allocation in 2023 of a total of 38,364 shares (0.05% of the share capital) to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to the Chief Operating Officer as 2022 performance shares, the balance of shares acquired under a previous buyback program and set aside for the distribution of performance shares and the potential arrangement of a liquidity contract to stimulate the market or ensure the liquidity of the stock through an investment service provider was 242,066 shares.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to allow the Company to trade in its own shares at any time, on March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting of May 16, 2024, that a new share buyback program be launched with a maximum price per share fixed at EUR 220, other conditions remaining unchanged (Resolution 14).\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 225-211 and R. 225-160 of the French Commercial Code, the Company maintains registers of the purchase and sale of shares acquired and sold in the context of its share buyback programs.\n\n### **Cancellation of shares through a capital reduction**\n\nUnder the authorization given by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022, the Board of Directors in its March 8, 2023 meeting canceled 409,072 shares (0.49% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and which had been allocated for cancellation.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the General Meeting authorized the Board of Directors, on the same terms as the authorizations granted since 2019, to:\n\n- reduce its share capital by way of cancellation, in one or more stages, of all or some of the shares acquired by the Company under a share buyback program, limited to 10% of the capital per 24 month period,\n- allocate the difference between the buyback value of canceled shares and their nominal value to premiums and available reserves.\n\nTo this end, the General Meeting has granted all powers to the Board of Directors to set the terms and conditions for any capital reductions consecutive to any cancellation operations decided upon.\n\nThis authorization was given for a period that expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nUnder this new authorization, the Board of Directors decided to cancel:\n\n- on May 16, 2023, 556,179 shares (0.67% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 18, 2022 and which had been allocated for cancellation,\n- on July 20, 2023, 1,719,413 shares (2.08% of the share capital) acquired under the share buyback program authorized by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 and which had been allocated for cancellation.\n\nIn order to allow the Company to reduce its share capital at any time, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of March 5, 2024, recommends to the General Meeting of May 16, 2024 that it authorize the Board to reduce the Company's share capital by the cancellation of shares purchased or to be purchased under a share buyback program (Resolution 15).\n\n### **Treasury shares as at December 31, 2023**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held 1,779,777 of its own shares (2.20% of the share capital) with a par value of EUR 0.80, for a gross purchase value of EUR 295,451,233.\n\nOf these 1,779,777 shares, 242,066 were allocated for the distribution of performance shares and the potential arrangement of a liquidity contract and 1,537,711 shares were allocated for cancellation.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **5.5.6. Significant agreements entered into by the Company**\n\nThe Company did not enter into any major agreement that would be amended or automatically terminated in the event of a change in control of the Company.\n\nHowever, in such a case, the National Defense contracts entered into with the French government would be reexamined by the French Ministry of Defense, which could require that all or some of these contracts be transferred to another French company for reasons of national interest.\n\nThere is no agreement offering compensation for:\n\n- members of the Board of Directors, should they resign or be dismissed,\n- for employees, should they resign or are dismissed without real and serious cause or if their employment is terminated due to a public tender offer, beyond the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **6.

You are asked to renew this term of office for a period of four years, i.e., until after the Annual General Meeting called in 2028 to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 (Resolution 10).\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appointment of Mazars and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit as joint sustainability auditors**\n\nThe Directive EU No 2022/2464 (\"CSRD\"), enacted into French law by Order (\"Ordonnance\") No 2023- 1142 dated December 6, 2023, provides for the introduction as of 2025 (relating to the 2024 financial statements) of a sustainability report to replace the Non-Financial Performance Declaration.\n\nThis sustainability report must be certified by one or more sustainability auditors who may be appointed from among the Company's Statutory Auditors or external firms. These sustainability auditors are appointed by the General Meeting upon recommendation by the Board of Directors.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Board of Directors, based on the advice of the Audit Committee, you are asked to approve the appointment of Mazars and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, the Company's current joint Statutory Auditors, as joint sustainability auditors for a period equivalent to that of their term of office as Statutory Auditors, i.e., until the end of the Annual General Meeting called in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the 2025 fiscal year (Resolutions 11 and 12).\n\n### **Approval of the related-party agreement for the acquisition by Dassault Aviation of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes from GIMD**\n\nAfter having reviewed the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements referred to in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the Annual General Meeting is called upon to approve the agreement concerning the acquisition by Dassault Aviation of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes (92) from GIMD.\n\nThis agreement was authorized by the Board of Directors at its meeting on March 8, 2023.\n\nThis acquisition was completed on June 27, 2023 for a total amount of EUR 25.24 million (excluding taxes and charges) (Resolution 13).\n\n### **Authorization to be given to the Board of Directors to allow the Company to purchase its own shares under a share buyback program**\n\nCompanies whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market are allowed to purchase their own shares if they are authorized by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nUnder Article L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the provisions of European Regulation 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, we ask you to reauthorize the Board of Directors to implement a share buyback program for a period of 18 months (Resolution 14).\n\nThe share buyback program would enable the Company:\n\n- 1) to cancel shares in order to increase the return on equity and earnings per share (subject to adopting Resolution 15),\n- 2) to transfer or allocate shares to employees and corporate officers of the Company and/or of affiliated companies under the terms and conditions stipulated by law, particularly in case of the exercising of stock options or allocation of existing free shares, or transferring and/or subscribing for existing shares as part as an employee stock ownership scheme,\n- 3) to stimulate market activity or increase the liquidity of Dassault Aviation shares through an investment services provider under a share liquidity contract compliant with an ethics charter recognized by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*),\n- 4) to retain the shares with a view to subsequent use, to remit them as payment or in exchange, including as part of any external growth transactions, for up to 5% of the share capital,\n- 5) to remit the shares upon exercise of rights attached to debt securities convertible to Dassault Aviation shares,\n- 6) to implement any market practice that would be recognized by the law or by the French Financial Markets Authority (*Autorité des Marchés Financiers*).\n\nThe Board could proceed with the buyback of Dassault Aviation shares within the legal limit of 10% of the Dassault Aviation share capital.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe maximum buyback price would be EUR 220 per share exclusive of acquisition costs (compared with EUR 200 in 2023). Considering the number of shares of the capital as of December 31, 2023, decreased by the number of shares canceled through the capital reduction decided by the Board of March 5, 2024, the maximum number of shares possibly acquired is 7,895,181, i.e. a maximum investment of EUR 1,736,939,820, this condition being combined with the condition of a cap of 10% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThis authorization would take effect at the next meeting of the Board of Directors which would decide whether to implement the new share buyback program, on which date the unused portion of the share buyback program previously authorized by the General Meeting of May 16, 2023 would be terminated.\n\n### **6.2. Resolutions for the Extraordinary General Meeting**\n\n### **Authorization to be given to the Board of Directors to reduce the Company's share capital by cancellation of shares purchased or to be purchased under the scope of a share buyback program**\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting is asked to authorize the Board of Directors, with the option of sub-delegation, to:\n\n- reduce its share capital by way of cancellation, in one or more stages, of all or some of the shares acquired by the Company under a share buyback program, limited to 10% of the share capital per 24-month period,\n- allocate the difference between the buyback value of canceled shares and their nominal value to premiums and available reserves.\n\nThis new authorization would be granted for a period that expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Resolution 15).\n\nAs of May 16, 2024, it would render the similar authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2023 ineffective for the unused portion.\n\n### **Authorization to be granted to the Board of Directors to allocate free shares of the Company to corporate officers and certain Company employees**\n\nThe authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the General Meeting of May 11, 2021 to allocate existing performance shares of the Company, to Company employees or certain employee categories and to the Company's eligible corporate officers, will expire on July 11, 2024.\n\nThe General Meeting is asked to renew this authorization (Resolution 16).\n\nThis allocation would be made within the limit of 242,066 shares (shares yet to be allocated).\n\nThis new authorization is proposed under similar terms to those currently in force.\n\nIt would be approved for a period of 38 months as of the General Meeting and would render ineffective, for the unused part, the authorization of the same nature approved by the General Meeting on May 11, 2021.\n\n### **Amendment of Article 11 of the Company's Articles of Association relating to the crossing of statutory thresholds**\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association provide for an obligation to provide information on the crossing of ownership thresholds. This applies to any fraction held that is equal to or greater than 1% of the capital and voting rights of the Company, and any multiple of that percentage, which exceeds or falls below those thresholds.\n\nDue to the shareholding structure, this provision is not of interest for fractions of 1% which exceed or fall below the ownership thresholds, beyond 50%.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result, a proposal is made to the next General Meeting to amend this statutory clause to remove the obligation to declare 1% crossing of ownership thresholds beyond 50% (Resolution°17).\n\nThe declaration of legal threshold crossings remains mandatory in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\n### **Miscellaneous amendments to the Company's Articles of Association to bring them into line with legal and regulatory provisions**\n\nIn view of the amendment proposed in the previous Resolution, we recommend that the Articles of Association be brought into line with legal and regulatory changes (Resolution 18).\n\nFor simplification purposes, certain amended articles simply refer to the legal and regulatory texts in force.\n\nThese amendments mainly relate to:\n\n- the persons authorized to certify copies or extracts of minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors (Article 17 of the Articles of Association),\n- the removal of reference to directors' fees which no longer exists in the French Commercial Code (Articles 22 and 32),\n- the Article relating to related-party agreements due to the disappearance of super-regulated agreements on deferred compensation at the end of terms of office which has been included in the Say on Pay policy (Article 24),\n- the share registration deadline to be able to take part in General Meetings which has been reduced to two days before the meeting (Article 29),\n- the deadline for sending voting forms by mail (Articles 31, 33 and 34),\n- majority rules at General Meetings which are calculated on the basis of votes cast (Articles 33 and 34).\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **7. OUTLOOK**\n\n2024 Objectives:\n\n- Deliver Rafale and Falcon,\n- Meet our schedule and cost commitments for Falcon and military developments,\n- Availability and support for our aircraft: maintain satisfaction levels among our military customers and regain our position as leader in business aviation support rankings,\n- Get a contract for the F5 standard preliminary studies,\n- FCAS/NGF: continue developing the demonstrator,\n- Make in India: ramp up the activities transferred to India,\n- Continue Rafale Export business development and increase Falcon sales efforts,\n- CSR: integrate new hires, continue our recruitment efforts and our action to reduce our environmental impact.\n\n### **2024 Guidance**\n\nWe forecast an increase in Group's revenue for 2024 compared to 2023, EUR 6 Billion range (of which deliveries of 35 Falcon and 20 Rafale).\n\n*This Directors' Report may contain forward-looking statements which represent objectives and cannot be construed as forecasts regarding the Group's results or any other performance indicator. The actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in this report.*\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appendix to the Directors' Report**\n\n### **Indicators**\n\nIn accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 and Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, the Directors' Report includes a non-financial performance declaration (NFPD) containing the following information:\n\n- Social information,\n- Environmental information,\n- Information relating to respect for Human Rights,\n- Information relating to the fight against corruption,\n- Information relating to the fight against tax avoidance.\n\n### **Scope of consolidation of the non-financial performance declaration**\n\nThe scope of the NFPD is based on the financial consolidation scope. However, due to restricted activity and/or workforce or the absence of control by Dassault Aviation, some subsidiaries have not been included. Therefore, the following were excluded:\n\n- Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd, Thales, Falcon Training Center and Aero Precision Repair & Overhaul Co., Inc., in which Dassault Aviation's stake is 50% or less,\n- Dassault Falcon Jet Leasing Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Falcon Jet Corporation), Dassault Falcon Jet Wilmington and ExecuJet MRO Services Middle East LLC, which had no significant CSR activity.\n\n### **Audit and consolidation of the NFPD**\n\nEach published indicator is subject to a reporting protocol detailing the definition of the indicator, the scope and the calculation methodology. Indicators are calculated on the basis of a calendar year (from January 1 to December 31).\n\nTaking into account the mode of data gathering and the locations of the subsidiaries, the reporting scope may vary according to the indicators. Certain indicators cannot be consolidated due to the differences in regulations between the countries.\n\nUnder the framework of ISO 14001 certification, reporting procedures for environmental indicators are applied by the Parent Company.\n\n### **Social and Human Resources Data**\n\nThe NFPD includes Dassault Aviation's policy on gender equality and equal pay, which the Board of Directors is required to deliberate under Article L. 225-37-1 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe social data of this report is based on fact sheets and methodology sheets that form the reference base for reporting social data of the Dassault Aviation Group, in force in 2023. The defined indicators are in compliance with national regulations.\n\nThe following details are given for the following indicators:\n\n- Employment:\n\t- o Registered headcount: all employees registered in the workforce as of December 31, regardless of the duration and nature of their employment contract (CDI, CDD, professional training contracts and apprentices). The departures on December 31, temporary workers, interns and subcontractors are excluded from this count.\n\t- o Active headcount: registered headcount less suspended contracts (sabbatical leave, business creation leave, other unpaid leave, uncompensated illnesses, disabilities, parental leave, endof-career leave) and professionalization and apprenticeship contracts.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n- absenteeism: the causes of absences taken into account for the absenteeism indicator are sickness, stoppages for work-related accidents and accidents when traveling to/from work, and unjustified absences. The indicated number of days are normal working days,\n- departures and dismissals: contractual terminations are to be counted as departures but are not counted within the number of dismissals,\n- Group compensation: the average annual compensation is a gross compensation that includes the base salary, the 13th month and the seniority bonus, excluding other bonuses,\n- Parent Company compensation: the average annual compensation is a gross figure that includes the base salary, the 13th month and the seniority bonus, excluding other bonuses, plus profitsharing and incentive schemes,\n- training hours: work-study training hours recorded in the training plan as well as the in-school training hours of professional development contracts are also taken into account. Training hours in the workplace are also taken into account when they are part of a training program with precise formal monitoring.\n\nConcerning the e-learning, only the hours of completed training are taken into account (status completed and/or validated in the *Learning Management System*, recording of the hours spent and of the training in SAP or issuance of a certificate at the end of the training provided that a minimum score is obtained on the end-of-training test).\n\nConcerning the English training at Dassault Aviation, the hours recorded correspond to the theoretical contractual hours. Reminders are sent to employees in order to encourage them to follow the training hours granted to them.\n\nGiven the management tools available to Dassault Aviation and given the closing deadlines, the Parent Company is not able to capture all of the sessions. Therefore, only 96% of the training sessions could be captured. The group continues to work on tools and processes to reduce the number of uncaptured sessions.\n\n### **Environmental Data**\n\nThe environmental indicators and the associated generation methods are subject to descriptive methodological procedures both for the Parent Company and for its subsidiaries.\n\nThese procedures are included in the documentation repository of the Parent Company and distributed to the various entities contributing to the generation of these indicators.\n\nThe year 2020, disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis, is not representative of the Company's activities. The year 2019 was therefore chosen as the reference year. In addition, the reporting of subsidiaries DABS and Execujet has only been effective since 2020, year of their integration into the Group.\n\nChanges in environmental indicators having as reference the year 2019 are therefore only available on the consolidated scope Parent Company, DFS, Sogitec and DFJ.\n\nThe balances are produced per calendar year and consolidated, when the data so allows, against invoices and meter readings for the period from January to December. Unavailable information relating to the last months of the year is estimated by comparison with the equivalent months of the previous year or based on the average for the same month of the last three years, or by any other relevant method due to the unrepresentativeness of data for 2020 and 2021, which were disrupted by Covid-19.\n\nThe data for year n-1, estimated at the time of publication of that financial year, are likely to change in the publication of the report for year n, after receiving the actual data.\n\nThe consumption of kerosene for maintenance activities is calculated on the basis of the purchased, non-reinvoiced fuel.\n\nThe consumption of kerosene for production activities includes both civil and military aircraft.\n\nAs no calculation method has proven to be sufficiently robust, the scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions item relating to upstream and downstream transport is not the subject of a quantitative publication this year. Work is ongoing to collect data from transportation providers.\n\nScope 3 sources of greenhouse gas emissions were analyzed and retained in the non-financial performance declaration if they were assessed as significant, or as non-significant but with accessible decarbonization levers.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Information relating to respect for Human Rights**\n\nDassault Aviation is committed to respecting human rights through its Code of Ethics, internal organization, the evaluation and monitoring of its suppliers, and the various international texts we adhere to. The measures taken to further this commitment are detailed in Section 4.8.\n\n#### **Information relating to the fight against corruption**\n\nIn accordance with Article 17 of Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 respecting transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernization of economic life, Dassault Aviation takes measures to prevent and detect, in France and abroad, acts of corruption or influence peddling.\n\n#### **Information relating to the fight against tax avoidance**\n\nDassault Aviation complies with the tax regulations in force and, as such, pays taxes in the countries in which it operates its industrial activity.\n\n#### **External Verification**\n\nThe non-financial data contained in the Non-Financial Performance Declaration and the methods used to compile and validate the data were subjected to an external audit by the independent third party Mazars.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Independent third-party report on the verification of the consolidated non-financial performance statement included in the director's report\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Dassault Aviation, appointed as independent third party and accredited by COFRAC under number 3-1895 (scope of accreditation available on www.cofrac.fr), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement (hereinafter the \"Information\" and the \"Statement\", respectively), prepared in accordance with the company's procedures (hereinafter the \"Guidelines\"), for the year ended 31 December 2023, presented in the Director's report of Dassault Aviation (hereinafter the \"Company\" or the \"Entity\") in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on our procedures as described in the section \"Nature and scope of procedures\" and the evidence we have obtained, no material misstatements have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial statement does not comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n### **Comments<sup>6</sup>**\n\nWithout calling into question the conclusion expressed above and in accordance with the provisions of Article A. 225-3 of the Commercial Code, we make the following comments:\n\n- The monitoring of key performance indicators related to training contains a degree of heterogeneity due to differences in the data collection systems put in place within the Group's entities.\n- As specified in the methodological note, available in the Appendix to this director's report, Dassault Aviation has not published greenhouse gas emissions linked to upstream and downstream transport activities for fiscal year 2023, but is working on a method for collecting from transport suppliers.\n\n <sup>6</sup> As stipulated in article A. 225-3 III, the ITO may decide, without having to make any reservations, to draw the reader's attention, without being the information provider, to elements relating to the procedures used or the content of certain information reported by the entity, for the purpose of improving its reliability, with regard to market practices, in particular on :\n\n<sup>-</sup> significant scope and comparability limits ;\n\n<sup>-</sup> the limits of the processes put in place to meet compliance requirements (business model, main risks, policies, actions, results and key performance indicators) and the results obtained; the reliability of results and key performance indicators.\n\nTo be of an observational nature, comments must be limited in scope to the key elements of the Declaration.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Preparation of the consolidated non-financial statement**\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information should be read and understood with reference to the Guidelines, the significant items of which are presented in the Statement.\n\n#### **Limits inherent in the preparation of the information relating to the Statement**\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n### **Responsibility of the Company**\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for:\n\n- selecting or determining the appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented with respect to these risks as well as the outcomes of these policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by applying the company's Guidelines as referred to above.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Independent Third Party**\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fairness of the historical information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks.\n\nWe conducted our work in order to provide a reasoned opinion expressing a moderate level of assurance on the historical, observed and extrapolated information.\n\nAs it is our responsibility to issue an independent conclusion on the Information prepared by management, we are not authorized to participate in the preparation of the Information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to provide a conclusion on:\n\n- the company's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the duty of vigilance and the fight against corruption and tax evasion);\n- the accuracy of information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance**\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and acting as the verification program and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\nThis report has been drawn up in accordance with the CSR\\_SQ\\_Verification program\\_NFPD\n\n### **Independence and quality control**\n\nOur independence is defined by Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie). In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n### **Means and resources**\n\nOur work engaged the skills of five people between November 2023 and February 2024 and took a total of four weeks.\n\nWe conducted some ten interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular the environment health and safety, human resources, ethics and anticorruption departments.\n\n### **Nature and scope of procedures**\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures conducted in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- we familiarized ourselves with all the activities of the companies in the consolidation scope and the description of the principal risks;\n- we assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector;\n- we verified that the Statement covers each category of information stipulated in section III of Article L. 225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the principal risks associated with the activities of all the consolidated entities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n- corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1. Concerning certain risks, such as those relating to traceability and obsolescence of hazardous substances, supply chain: customer duty and ethical business conduct, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n- we verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16;\n- we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the company and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:\n\t- analytical procedures that consisted in verifying the correct consolidation of collected data as well as the consistency of changes thereto;\n\t- substantive tests, on a sample basis and using other selection methods, that consisted in verifying the proper application of definitions and procedures and reconciling data with supporting documents. These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities and covered between 29% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests.\n- we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less extensive than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des commissaires aux comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nIndependent third-party\n\nMazars\n\nErwan Candau Partner\n\nSouad El Ouazzani CSR & Sustainable Development Partner\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Appendix 1: The most important information**\n\n| Issues                                              | Key performance indicator                    | Assurance level    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Traceability and hazardous substances' obsolescence | Number of hazardous products substituted     |                    |\n| Employment and skills                               | Workforce                                    |                    |\n|                                                     | Percentage of employees trained              |                    |\n| Health, safety and working conditions               | Frequency rate of work-related accidents     |                    |\n|                                                     | Severity rate of accidents at work           | Limited assurance. |\n| Climate changes                                     | Energy consumption by source                 |                    |\n|                                                     | Greenhouse gas emissions, scopes 1 and 2     |                    |\n| Supply Chain : customer duty                        | Percentage of new supplier assessed          |                    |\n|                                                     | Percentage of suppliers with potential risks |                    |\n| Ethical business conduct                            | Number of corruption                         |                    |\n|                                                     | Number of training offered                   |                    |\n|                                                     | Number of employees trained                  |                    |\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking readers.

The Legal Affairs and Insurance Department and the Financial Department carried out preparatory checks on the drafting of said report, which was then reviewed by the Statutory Auditors as part of their due diligence and approved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **1. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**\n\n### **1.1. Corporate governance guidelines**\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-10 4° of the French Commercial Code, Dassault Aviation decided in 2021, after reviewing the provisions of the current corporate governance codes issued by AFEP-MEDEF and Middlenext, that those codes do not constitute its corporate governance guidelines.\n\n- The Company does not refer to the aforementioned codes as a result of its specific situation and in particular due to:\n\t- the family nature of its shareholding structure since its beginning, with a majority of the shares held by GIMD, a company owned by the Dassault family, which is a full-fledged stakeholder in the Company's strategic choices,\n\t- its uniqueness, which is the distinctive feature of Dassault Aviation's pioneering role in the implementation of certain practices, especially in the area of labor relations, such as paid vacations and profit-sharing and incentive schemes,\n\t- its simple, centralized and reactive organization,\n\t- its story marked by the high stability of its management team, with five Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers since the post-war period, in line with the long cycles specific to its industry sector,\n\t- a rigorous culture that guides its operations on a day-to-day basis.\n- The Company's governance is based on the following principles:\n\t- the desire to foster a stable shareholding structure, reflecting its nature as a family business with long-term shareholder investment,\n\t- a skilled, experienced Board of Directors with in-depth knowledge of the business,\n\t- the striving for balance on the Board of Directors, with members from the family circle, independent directors and a director representing employees,\n\t- the ambition for diversity and gender parity in the composition of the Board of Directors, with balanced representation of women and men on the Board of Directors,\n\t- the transparency of the corporate officers' compensation.\n\nFurthermore, Dassault Aviation has decided to adopt a certain number of governance rules in addition to the legal requirements:\n\n- the Board of Directors' internal regulations posted on the Company's website [\\(www.dassault](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/)[aviation.com\\)](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/), which specifies the operating rules governing the Board of Directors,\n- a specific definition of independence (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the introduction of specific rules concerning the identification and prevention of conflicts of interest on the Board of Directors, supplementing the Internal Charter on related-party agreements (see paragraph 1.4 \"Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the staggered renewal of directors' terms of office (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- detailed information communicated to shareholders when Directors are appointed or reappointed (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the ownership by each director of a minimum number of shares to be retained as registered shares throughout his or her term of office (see paragraph 1.2 \"Composition of the Board of Directors\"),\n- a reminder to directors of the qualities required and of the rules of professional ethics for the performance of their duties (this information is available in the Board of Directors' internal regulations available on the Company's website [www.dassault-aviation.com\\)](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/),\n- a minimum of two meetings per year of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, given the Group's long business cycles (see paragraph 1.4 \"Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors\"),\n- the suspension of the employment contracts of corporate officers.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nLastly, with regard to the executive corporate officers' compensation, the Company applies all provisions of the laws in force.\n\n### **1.2. Composition of the Board of Directors**\n\nAs of the date of this report, the Board of Directors is composed of eight members with the experience and expertise required to fulfill their office: Éric Trappier (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and Charles Edelstenne (Honorary Chairman), Besma Boumaza, Marie-Hélène Habert and Lucia Sinapi-Thomas, Thierry Dassault, Henri Proglio and Stéphane Marty (director representing employees), with renewable four-year terms of office.\n\nThe table below shows the expiration dates of the terms of office of the directors, which are renewed on a staggered basis.\n\n| Name                | Office                                                            | Âge at<br>12/31/2023 | Independent<br>Director | First term<br>of office | Expiration of<br>Current term | Seniority<br>on the<br>Board of<br>Directors |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Éric Trappier       | Chairman and<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Director               | 63                   |                         | 2013<br>2012            | 2027<br>2027                  | 11                                           |\n| Charles Edelstenne  | Honorary Chairman<br>Director<br>Member of the Audit<br>Committee | 85                   |                         | 1989                    | 2027                          | 34                                           |\n| Thierry Dassault    | Director                                                          | 66                   |                         | 2021                    | 2027                          | 2                                            |\n| Marie-Hélène Habert | Director                                                          | 58                   |                         | 2014                    | 2026                          | 9                                            |\n| Besma Boumaza       | Director                                                          | 47                   | Yes                     | 2021                    | 2024                          | 2                                            |\n| Henri Proglio       | Director<br>Chairman of the Audit<br>Committee                    | 74                   | Yes                     | 2008                    | 2026                          | 15                                           |\n| Lucia Sinapi-Thomas | Director<br>Member of the Audit<br>Committee                      | 59                   | Yes                     | 2014                    | 2027                          | 9                                            |\n| Stéphane Marty      | Administrateur<br>representing employees                          | 65                   |                         | 2021                    | 2026                          | 3                                            |\n\n### **COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON DECEMBER 31, 2023**\n\nThe aforementioned directors are all of French nationality.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the directors are aged between 47 and 85 with an average age of 65. This includes the director representing employees.\n\nThree women currently sit on the Board of Directors, out of a total of seven members (excluding the director representing employees, in accordance with the law). This equates to a percentage of 43% women, which is above the legal requirement of 40% set by Article L. 225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code, as referred to in Article L. 22-10-3 of the French Commercial Code concerning gender-balanced representation on Boards of Directors.\n\n### **1.2.1. Independence of Directors**\n\nDassault Aviation recognizes the importance of having a number of independent directors on its Board of Directors. The Group considers a director to be independent if he or she has no vested interests and contributes, through his or her skills and freedom of judgment, to the Board's ability to perform its duties. To be classified as independent, directors must not be in a position likely to alter their freedom of judgment or place them in a real or potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe status of independent director is reviewed annually and when a new director is appointed or their term of office is renewed, in view of following formal criteria:\n\n- 1. not have been an employee or have held an executive position within the Company or a company controlled by it in the five preceding years,\n- 2. not being an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a directorship, or in which an employee designated as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company holds a directorship,\n- 3. not being or representing a major shareholder,\n- 4. not being or representing, in a significant way, a commercial (customer, supplier) or financial partner (investment banker, commercial banker), stakeholder or consultant,\n- 5. not be closely related to a major shareholder or executive member,\n- 6. not have been a statutory auditor of the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors may find that a director who does not meet these criteria is nevertheless independent.\n\nThe outcomes of this review are communicated to the shareholders annually in the present Report on Corporate Governance and prior to any vote on the first appointment or reappointment of a director.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below summarizes the outcome of the independence review of each of the directors concerned according to the criteria set out above:\n\n|                                                                                                 | Besma<br>Boumaza | Lucia<br>Sinapi-Thomas | Henri<br>Proglio |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 - not have been an employee or have held an executive position in the five<br>preceding years | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 2 - does not exercise cross mandates                                                            | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 3 - does not represent a major shareholder                                                      | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 4 - no close relationship with a commercial or financial partner                                | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 5 - not be closely related to a major shareholder or executive member                           | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n| 6 - not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company                                            | ✓                | ✓                      | ✓                |\n\nAt its meeting on March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors confirmed, following consideration, that Besma Boumaza, Lucia Sinapi-Thomas and Henri Proglio were independent directors in accordance with the Company's independence criteria. The three independent directors out of a total of seven board members (excluding the director representing employees) represent 43% of the Board of Directors (which is above the legal requirement of one independent director).\n\n### **1.2.2. Information for shareholders in the event of the appointment of a director or renewal of his or her term of office**\n\nWhenever a director is appointed or reappointed, shareholders are provided with detailed information on his or her education and professional experience, which, in addition to his or her personal qualities and values, reflects his or her skill and ability to serve out that term of office.\n\n### **1.2.3. Director representing employees**\n\nThe director representing employees, Stéphane Marty, was reappointed on July 10, 2022, for a fouryear term of office.\n\n### **1.2.4. Directors' share ownership obligation**\n\nIn accordance with Article 15 of the Company's Articles of Association and Article 4 of the Board of Directors' internal regulations, each director, with the exception of the director representing employees in accordance with the law, is required to own a minimum of 250 shares (pro forma after the division of the par value of the shares) in registered form throughout his or her entire term of office. The number of shares held as of December 31, 2023 by each director is specified in paragraph 1.3 \"List of Offices held and duties performed by corporate officers in 2023\".\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.3.

Conditions for preparing and organizing the work of the Board of Directors**\n\n#### **1.4.1. Directors' information**\n\nTo ensure the attendance of Directors at Board meetings, the Board of Directors determines the meeting schedule of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee from one year to the next. This schedule is updated and regular reminders are sent to participants by the Secretary to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors meets at least twice a year to approve the company and interim financial statements and as often as required in the interests of the Company.\n\nThe notices of Board meetings specifying the agenda are sent to the directors, the Statutory Auditors and the Government Commissioner at least one week in advance, except in case of emergencies.\n\nPrior to each Board meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that each director receives a complete, relevant, balanced file of information with a sufficient period of time, except in case of emergencies, to enable him or her to prepare for said meeting.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors and the Government Commissioner receive the same documents as the Directors.\n\n### **1.4.2. Activities of the Board of Directors in 2023**\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors met three times, on March 8, May 16 and July 20.\n\nThe average attendance rate at Board meetings was 91.7%.\n\nThe Board of Directors supervised the implementation of the strategies chosen and reviewed the Company's general operations. In particular, the Board of Directors:\n\n- analyzed the amount for order intake, the order book and net sales, and self-financed consolidated research and development,\n- monitored the roll-out of civil and military programs,\n- set the medium-term strategy in the civil and military domains.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors:\n\n- approved the fiscal year 2022 company and consolidated financial statements,\n- convened the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2023,\n- approved the financial statements for the first half-year of 2023,\n- finalized the Parent company's forward-looking management documents in March and July 2023, and reviewed the budgets for self-financed technology investments and industrial investments,\n- carried out the annual review of related-party agreements approved in previous fiscal years,\n- was informed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the amount of sureties, endorsements and guarantees granted for commitments by controlled subsidiaries,\n- authorized the signing of the agreement for the acquisition by Dassault Aviation from GIMD of the Le Vinci building in Suresnes for EUR 25.24 million,\n- approved the wording of the half-yearly and annual financial press releases,\n- evaluated the performance criteria relating to performance shares granted in 2022 and noted the acquisition of said shares by their beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period,\n- conducted another performance share plan by preparing the list of beneficiaries and defining the conditions under which their shares become fully vested (achievement of performance criteria, vesting and holding periods, employment on the day the shares become fully vested), with delegation to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of all powers to implement the allocation of performance shares,\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n- conducted an assessment of the performance criterion for additional pension rights, for the 2022 fiscal year, for executive corporate officers that was consistent with legal requirements,\n- set the performance criterion for additional pension rights for the 2023 fiscal year,\n- approved the compensation allocated and paid in fiscal year 2022 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the directors,\n- set the principles of compensation for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Directors for fiscal year 2023,\n- put the new share buyback program into effect and sub-delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to perform any transaction under that program, subject to the conditions set by the General Meeting,\n- allocated the shares acquired under share buyback programs,\n- decided, as authorized by the General Meeting, to reduce the Company's share capital in March, May and July 2023 through the cancellation of shares purchased under the share buyback programs and delegated powers to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to implement the above capital reductions.\n- renewed the terms of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer Éric Trappier and of the Chief Operating Officer Loïk Segalen, and approved the renewal of their compensation and additional benefits in accordance with the Compensation Policy 2023.\n\n### **1.4.3. Audit Committee**\n\nPursuant to the order (\"Ordonnance\") of December 8, 2008, which transposed Directive 2006/43/EC of May 17, 2006 on statutory audits of company and consolidated financial statements, on July 22, 2009 the Board of Directors established an Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2023, the Audit Committee met twice: on March 3 for the 2022 financial statements and on July 19 for the financial statements for the first half of 2023. The attendance rate of Committee members at meetings in 2023 was 100%.\n\nThe Audit Committee consists of Henri Proglio, Chairman, Charles Edelstenne and Lucia Sinapi-Thomas. They were appointed because of the expertise they received from their academic training, their experience in finance and accounting for listed companies, and their time as members of executive management. All three are non-executive directors.\n\nThis composition meets the requirements of the aforementioned order (\"Ordonnance\"). The Board of Directors considered that Lucia Sinapi-Thomas and Henri Proglio met the independence criteria set forth in paragraph 1.2.1. above.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring:\n\n- the procedure for preparing the financial information,\n- the effectiveness of the risk management and internal auditing systems,\n- the auditing of the company and consolidated financial statements by the Statutory Auditors,\n- the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets at least twice a year. Participants, including the Statutory Auditors, are notified of this via a schedule set from one year to the next. The schedule is sent to all participants and meeting reminders are sent by the Secretary of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Audit Committee:\n\n- examined the company and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year, the financial statements for the first half of 2023, the Parent Company's forward-looking management documents and the main events of the relevant year or half-year,\n- reviewed the risk factors, the internal auditing and the risk management of the Directors' report,\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n- met with the Statutory Auditors, with no Company representatives being present, after examining the conclusions of their work and their declaration of independence,\n- reviewed the annual feedback on the assessment carried out by the Financial Department and the Legal Affairs and Insurance Department on related-party agreements,\n- reviewed the Risk Committee's summary, the 2023 audit plan, the update on 2022 actions and the follow-up on actions from the 2020 and 2021 audits,\n- reported back on its work to the Board of Directors.\n\n### **1.4.4. Board of Directors' internal regulations**\n\nIn addition to the Articles of Association, which set out the Company's rules of operation, the Board meeting of July 25, 2012 approved the Board of Directors' internal regulations, which allow in particular directors to take part in meetings (debating and voting) by means of telecommunications that are compliant with applicable regulations. On March 4, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new version of the Board of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe Board of Directors' internal regulations will be updated in 2024 to reflect Order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 which transposed Directive EU 2022/2464 of December 14, 2022 as regards corporate sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Board of Directors' internal regulations are available for viewing online on the Company's website at [www.dassault-aviation.com.](http://www.dassault-aviation.com/)\n\n### **1.4.5. Prevention and management of conflicts of interest**\n\nWith respect to the prevention and management of conflicts of interest, directors are required to inform the Board of Directors of any situation of potential or actual conflict of interest between them and the corporate interests of Dassault Aviation and must, where applicable, refrain from attending the discussions and abstain from voting on the corresponding deliberation at the meeting.\n\nIn particular, at any time, the participation of any director in a transaction in which Dassault Aviation has a direct interest or of which he or she became aware as a director shall be brought to the attention of the Board of Directors prior to its conclusion.\n\nIn addition, GIMD, as the majority shareholder of Dassault Aviation, takes care to prevent potential conflicts of interest with respect to the Directors appointed on its proposal.\n\nas of the date of this report and to the best of the Company's knowledge, there is no potential conflict of interest between the duties of the directors with respect to Dassault Aviation and their private interests.\n\nThese measures are supplemented by the Internal Charter on related-party agreements described in paragraph 1.5.2. of this report.\n\n### **1.4.6. Prevention and management of insider dealing**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions resulting from the European Regulation of April 16, 2014, on market abuse and the AMF Guide for ongoing information and the management of inside information, published on October 26, 2016, and updated on April 29, 2021, the Company established procedures for \"blackout periods\" (periods when transactions involving the shares issued by the Company are prohibited), which begin at least 30 days before the publication of the company annual and half-yearly financial statements. When the Company publishes financial press releases after the close of the stock market, the date of publication is included in the blackout period.\n\nEvery year, the directors are informed by letter of the calendar of \"black-out periods\" for the coming year.\n\nThe financial calendar is published online on the Company's website at the start of each financial period.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the list of permanent and occasional insiders is reviewed quarterly and at any other time as needed.\n\n### **1.5. Related-party agreements**\n\n### **1.5.1. Agreements between a shareholder or a corporate officer of the Company and one of its subsidiaries**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 225-37-4-2° of the French Commercial Code, must be mentioned in the Report on Corporate Governance, agreements entered into, directly or indirectly or by proxy between:\n\n- one of the corporate officers or shareholders of Dassault Aviation holding a fraction greater than 10% of the voting rights and\n\n- a controlled company by Dassault Aviation under Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, with the exception of agreements representing a current transaction entered into under normal terms and conditions.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there is no agreement between:\n\n- a corporate officer of Dassault Aviation or GIMD, which holds more than 10% of the voting rights in Dassault Aviation and\n- Dassault Falcon Jet (or one of its subsidiaries), Dassault Falcon Service, Sogitec Industries or any other controlled company by Dassault Aviation under Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code,\n\nthat would not constitute a current transaction concluded under normal terms and conditions.\n\n### **1.5.2. Internal Charter on regulated related-party agreements and agreements representing a current transaction entered into under normal terms and conditions**\n\nIn accordance with Law No. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 on the growth and transformation of companies, so-called \"Pacte\", the Board of Directors of the Company established a procedure for regularly assessing whether agreements deemed to be current fulfill the following two conditions: relate to current transactions and be entered into under normal conditions.\n\nThis procedure, as expressed in an Internal Charter, was approved by the Dassault Aviation Board of Directors on February 26, 2020 and has been applicable since that date. It is based on the joint evaluation by the Financial Department and the Legal Affairs and Insurance Department of the Company, followed by the Audit Committee.\n\n### **1.6. Methods of the exercise of Executive Management**\n\nIn accordance with the laws in force, the possibility of separating the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive Officer was introduced into the Company's Articles of Association during the General Meeting of April 25, 2002.\n\nOn April 25, 2002, the Board of Directors decided that the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be responsible for the Executive Management of the Company.\n\nThis was because the Board of Directors had chosen the Executive Management option that it deemed best suited to the Company's specific features. The decision was therefore made not to separate the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSince January 9, 2013, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been assisted by a Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThis mode of Executive Management was maintained by the Board of Directors on May 16, 2023, when it also renewed the terms of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer for four years with the same powers.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.7. Powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n\nThe powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not limited by the Company's Articles of Association nor by the Board of Directors, in the decisions appointing him and subsequently renewing his term of office.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes and directs the work of the Board, reporting back on this to the General Meeting. The Chairman executes the decisions of the Board. He sees to it that the Company management bodies run smoothly and ensures that the directors are able to fulfill their duties.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer therefore exercises his powers with no limitations other than those set forth by the applicable regulations concerning the powers attributed expressly by law to General Meetings of shareholders and to the Board of Directors.\n\n### **1.8. Powers of the Chief Operating Officer**\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer assists the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. With respect to third parties, he has the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n### **1.9. Executive Committee**\n\nPresided over by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Committee includes the persons in charge of the Company's various departments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, it consisted of:\n\n- Éric Trappier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\n- Loïk Segalen, Chief Operating Officer,\n- Jean-Marie Albertini, Senior Vice-President, Sales,\n- Laurent Bendavid, Senior Executive Vice-President, IT and Chief Digital Officer,\n- Carlos Brana, Senior Executive Vice-President, Civil Aircraft,\n- Bruno Chevalier, Senior Executive Vice-President, Military Customer Support,\n- Bruno Coiffier, Senior Executive Vice-President, Procurement and Purchasing,\n- Denis Dassé, Chief Financial Officer,\n- Jean-Marc Gasparini, Executive Vice-President, Military and Space Programs,\n- Florent Gateau, Senior Executive Vice-President, Total Quality,\n- Bruno Giorgianni, Executive Committee Secretary and Senior Vice-President, Public Affairs and Security,\n- Valérie Guillemet, Senior Vice-President, Human Resources,\n- Richard Lavaud, Senior Executive Vice-President, International,\n- Nicolas Mojaïsky\\*, Senior Executive Vice-President, Engineering,\n- Frédéric Petit, Senior Vice-President, Falcon Programs,\n- Ary Plagnol, Senior Executive Vice-President, Industrial Operations.\n\n\\* Following the retirement of Nicolas Mojaïsky, Pascale Lohat took over as Senior Executive Vice-President, Engineering, from January 1, 2024.\n\nThe Executive Committee covers all subjects related to running and operating the different aspects of the Company. It meets once per week.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.10. Gender parity on the management bodies (information referred to in Article L. 22-10-10 2° of the French Commercial Code)**\n\nOur Company is mainly masculine due to the highly industrial and technical nature of its activity. Women represent between 18% and 28% of the engineering schools' population, depending on specialization.\n\nBeing conscious of the importance of gender parity, the Company has adopted a proactive policy for hiring women, which has been strengthened since 2010 with quantified recruitment targets. Over a 10 year period, this has increased the percentage of women, from 16.5% to 19.4% in 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, women account for 15% of the most senior positions (position IIIB and above) and 7% of management positions. The Company has set quantitative and qualitative objectives to improve this situation:\n\n- continue with educational cooperation schemes to promote careers in aeronautics and encourage young women to enter this field,\n- hire women for executive employees positions, to take advantage of their skills and increase the percentage of women,\n- improve the presence of women in the chain of command, in management positions and in positions of responsibility,\n- ensure each year that the gender parity is respected in the distribution of individual increases and promotions,\n- converge toward an equivalent average length of time between two promotions between male and female executive employees.\n\nIn addition, promotions to the highest levels of responsibility are subject to an annual review by the Executive Management to ensure that women are properly represented.\n\n### **1.11. General Meeting of shareholders**\n\n### **1.11.1. Admission**\n\nThe conditions governing shareholders' attendance at General Meetings are set forth in Articles 29 and 31 of the Articles of Association.

Voting rights**\n\nSubject to special circumstances set forth by law, all members present at the General Meeting have as many votes, without limitation, as the number of fully paid-up shares they own or represent.\n\nSince April 3, 2016, the shares issued by the Company registered in nominal accounts for more than two years receive double voting rights.\n\nVoting is performed by the raising of hands and/or use of voting slips.\n\nA secret ballot may be requested, either by the Board of Directors or by shareholders representing at least one quarter of the share capital, subject to the submission of written notification to the Board of Directors or the authority convening the meeting at least three days prior to the General Meeting.\n\nShareholders may also vote by correspondence in accordance with the legal conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the Articles of Association of the Company state that:\n\n- voting may be performed using OCR slips or electronically,\n- shareholders may also, if the Board has so decided upon convening the meeting, vote by any means of telecommunication that enables them to be identified, subject to and according to the procedures provided for by applicable laws and regulations.\n\n### **1.11.3.

Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024**\n\nThe purpose of this paragraph is to set forth the components of the compensation policy for directors and executive corporate officers for 2024. This compensation policy is subject to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (Resolutions 7, 8 and 9 as described in the paragraph \"Presentation of resolutions submitted to shareholder vote\" below).\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 paragraph II of the French Commercial Code, we confirm that the payment of variable and exceptional compensation elements is contingent on approval by the Ordinary General Meeting of the compensation elements of the persons concerned.\n\n### **2.2.1. Compensation policy for Directors**\n\nCompensation is allocated annually according to the following principles:\n\n- for the Board of Directors:\n\t- o fixed compensation of EUR 28,000,\n\t- o variable compensation of EUR 10,000 multiplied by the attendance rate at meetings,\n\nthese amounts are doubled for the Chairman of the Board of Directors,\n\n- for the Audit Committee: variable compensation only dependent on attendance at meetings of EUR 3,000 per meeting (double for the Chairman).\n\nThe overall amount authorized by the General Meeting of May 15, 2014 (EUR 444,000) was not modified.\n\nIn addition, each Director is covered by a Directors' and Officers' liability insurance policy (known in French as RCMS). This policy covers all managers and corporate officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n### **2.2.2. Compensation policy for corporate officers**\n\nThe principles of the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer have been established by the Board of Directors.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer consists of fixed compensation and variable compensation.\n\nThe target variable compensation implemented in 2024:\n\n- EUR 1,800,000 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer compensated by the reduction of 10,000 allocated performance shares,\n- EUR 1,602,000 for the Chief Operating Officer compensated by a reduction of 8,900 allocated performance shares.\n\nThis compensation is subject to the same conditions and performance criteria as the performance shares presented below.\n\nThe fixed compensation and the variable compensation change according to the increase policy for executive employees of the Company resulting from the Annual Mandatory Negotiations, unless decided otherwise by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, under their respective mandates, will not receive:\n\n- any exceptional compensation,\n- any stock options,\n- any private unemployment insurance,\n- any severance packages,\n- any special supplementary pensions.\n\nIn 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer will receive performance shares.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to award them 13,000 and 8,000 shares, respectively. These shares will become vested provided the following performance criteria are met:\n\n- adjusted Group operating margin,\n- two aspects of corporate social responsibility, namely:\n\t- o feminization,\n\t- o the low-carbon plan,\n- qualitative assessment of individual performance.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors has determined the following additional conditions:\n\n- a vesting period of one year, expiring on March 4, 2025 inclusive,\n- presence in the workforce at the end of the vesting period,\n- a one-year holding period, beginning on March 5, 2025 and ending on March 4, 2026 inclusive,\n- starting on March 5, 2026, retention by the corporate officers of 20% of those shares for the duration of their term of office.\n\nIn addition, the 2024 Share plan prohibits executive corporate officers who have been granted performance shares from using risk hedging until after the end of the holding period.\n\nThe employment contracts of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Chief Operating Officer have been suspended. Upon effective reinstatement of the contracts, they will recover the rights of salaried senior executives in their category, according to the Company's rules, which will be revalued at the date of termination of their term of office by the average percentage increase in executive salaries during the period of suspension of the employment contract.\n\nIn particular, upon effective reinstatement of their contracts, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer shall be subject to the conditions of severance pay applicable to employees of their category in accordance with Company rules, it being specified that, depending on the formula chosen, the seniority taken into account may cover the years during which their employment contract was suspended, like the other employees.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor supplementary pensions, they are eligible for:\n\n- the rights acquired under the plan applicable to executive employees of the Company, which have been frozen as of December 31, 2017,\n- the rights acquired in 2018 and 2019 under the pension plan established on January 1, 2018, which is applicable to members of the Executive Committee and to the Company's flight crew currently grounded in accordance with order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 regarding supplementary defined-benefit pensions,\n- the rights acquired under the plan applicable as of January 1, 2020 to members of the Executive Committee and the Company's flight crew, which provides for the annual vesting of additional pension rights equal to 2% of gross annual compensation, subject to performance conditions defined each year by the Board of Directors, which shall duly note the achievement thereof.\n\nIn addition, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, like the Directors, are each covered by a Directors' and Corporate Officers' Liability Insurance policy (known in French as RCMS). This policy covers all managers and corporate officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nFinally, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer shall each receive, during the performance of their terms of office, a chauffeur-driven company car, reimbursement of the actual expenses incurred in their duties, and health and welfare plans applicable to all of the Company's executive employees.\n\n### **2.2.3. Presentation of resolutions submitted to shareholder vote**\n\nThe \"Sapin 2\" Law introduced a new shareholder consultation regime for the compensation of corporate officers, as amended by order (\"Ordonnance\") No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019, and supplemented by Decree No. 2019-1235 of the same day.\n\nShareholders are called upon to express an opinion in two stages:\n\n- vote after the fact (referred to as an \"ex-post vote\"): the compensation elements paid or attributed to directors and corporate officers during the past fiscal year, as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance, shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders.\n- -\n- advance vote on compensation policy (referred to as an \"ex-ante\" vote): the compensation policy for directors and corporate officers, as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance, shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders,\n\nConsequently, the following resolutions will be submitted for your approval:\n\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the directors as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 4),\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 5),\n- Approval of compensation elements paid or allocated during fiscal year 2023 to the Chief Operating Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.1 \"Compensation paid to directors and corporate officers in 2023\" (Resolution 6),\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the directors as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 7),\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 8),\n- Approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the Chief Operating Officer as presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in paragraph 2.2 \"Compensation policy for corporate officers and directors in 2024\" (Resolution 9).\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3.

These consolidated financial statements will be submitted for approval to the annual general meeting on May 16, 2024.\n\n### **1.1. Basis of preparation for the 2023 consolidated financial statements**\n\nDassault Aviation Group consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations as adopted by the European Union and applicable at the closing date.\n\nSince January 1, 2023, the Group has applied the following standards, amendments and interpretations:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" on significant accounting policies disclosures,\n- amendments to IAS 8 \"Definition of Accounting Estimates,\"\n- amendments to IAS 12 on deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction,\n- amendments to IAS 12 relating to income taxes following the approval of Pillar II model rules.\n\nThese texts have no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **1.2. New standards mandatory after December 31, 2023**\n\nThe following texts have still not been applied in advance by the Group when that option was offered.\n\nThe main texts adopted by the European Union whose application is mandatory after January 1, 2024 are as follows:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\", on the classification of liabilities as current or non-current and non-current liabilities with covenants,\n- amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 relating to supplier finance arrangements,\n- amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\" relating to lease liabilities in a sale and leaseback,\n\nThe potential impacts of these texts on the Group's financial statements are currently being assessed.\n\n### **1.3. Impact of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia**\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which Russia started on February 24, 2022, triggered a major crisis in the aviation sector, leading to shortages and putting significant pressure on supplies. The risk is that it could have a lasting impact on the Group and its partners, sub-contractors and customers. The regulations adopted by the European Union and the United States are strictly enforced by the Group, especially the ban on commercial transactions and the restriction on financial transactions with sanctioned persons or entities. Some entities in the maintenance network in Europe have been significantly affected by the loss of Russian customers. Operations in Russia, the Moscow office and the Dassault Falcon Service maintenance subsidiary, have stopped doing business.\n\nAs of December 31, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict had no material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.4. Accounting choices and management estimates**\n\nTo prepare the Group's financial statements, Management is required to make estimates and issue assumptions that could have an impact on the amounts entered in the balance sheet and in the income statement.\n\nThese estimates concern, in particular:\n\n- the results of contracts in progress,\n- the calculation of provisions for contingencies and charges and provisions for impairment,\n- the calculation of development costs that meet capitalization criteria,\n- the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nThese estimates are calculated by taking into account past experience, elements known at the closing date and any reasonable change assumptions.\n\nThe estimates used by the Group to prepare the financial statements take into account, as far as the available information allows, the risks induced by climate change whether physical, regulatory or related to customer expectations and sector commitments. Their impact on cash flow has been integrated into the business plans of the cash-generating units concerned.\n\nSubsequent results may therefore differ from such estimates.\n\n### **1.5. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nConsolidated balance sheet items are presented as current/non-current. The Group's activities have long operating cycles. As a result, the assets/liabilities generally realized in the context of the operating cycle (inventories and work-in-progress, contract assets and liabilities, receivables, payables, etc.) are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets and liabilities, without distinction between the amount due within one year and the amount due at more than one year.\n\nConsolidated income statement items are presented by nature.\n\nNet operating income represents all income and expenses not arising from financial activities, equity associates, discontinued operations or operations being sold, and income taxes. It is composed of two separate parts: current operating income and other non-current income and expenses. Only significant unusual items are recorded in other non-current income and expenses. No items met this criteria in 2023 or in 2022.\n\n### **1.6. Segment reporting**\n\nIFRS 8, \"Operating Segments,\" requires the presentation of information according to internal management criteria. The activity of the Dassault Aviation Group relates entirely to the aerospace domain. Internal reporting to the chairman and chief executive officer and to the chief operating officer, used for strategy and decision-making, does not include a performance analysis, under IFRS 8 terms, at a lower level than this sector.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.7. Consolidation principles and methods**\n\n### **1.7.1. Scope and methods of consolidation**\n\n### **Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe financial statements of material subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by Dassault Aviation are fully consolidated. Material subsidiaries jointly controlled by Dassault Aviation (joint ventures) or in which the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nConsolidated companies are listed in note 2.\n\n#### **Consolidation thresholds**\n\nFor the application of the factor of relative significance, a company controlled by the Group or in which it has significant influence is included in the scope of consolidation if all of the following criteria are met: total assets and liabilities exceed 2% of the Group total,\n\n- total net sales exceed 2% of the Group total,\n- equity exceeds 3% of the Group total.\n\nEntities can be consolidated by a management decision even though they do not meet the criteria previously defined. As of December 31, 2023, all non-consolidated companies do not collectively exceed the thresholds described above.\n\n#### **Inter-company transactions**\n\nAll material inter-company transactions and internal margins included in non-current assets, inventories and work-in-progress are eliminated.\n\n#### **Closing date**\n\nThe majority of companies close their fiscal year on December 31.\n\n#### **1.7.2. Conversion of financial statements of non-euro area subsidiaries**\n\nThe currency used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is the euro.\n\nThe financial statements of non-euro area subsidiaries are translated as follows:\n\n- assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate,\n- the income statement is translated at the average annual rate.\n\nCurrency translation adjustments are recognized in equity and do not impact the income statement.\n\n### **1.8. Valuation principles**\n\n### **1.8.1. Goodwill and business combinations**\n\nBusiness combinations are recognized under the acquisition method as described in IFRS 3. Under this method, the Group recognizes the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill, which reflects the difference between the acquisition cost of investments and the share of the revalued net assets, is recognized:\n\nimmediately as a loss when it is negative,\n\n- on the asset side of the balance sheet when it is positive:\n- under goodwill if the acquired company is fully consolidated,\n- under equity associates if the acquired company is consolidated under the equity method.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price is finalized within a maximum period of one year from the date of acquisition.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to annually impairment tests (see note 1.8.3. Impairment and recoverable value).\n\nAcquisition-related costs (valuation fees, consulting fees, etc.) are recognized under operating income as incurred.\n\n### **1.8.2. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\n### **Accounting principles**\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition or production cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization and impairment. Each identified component of an intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment is recognized and depreciated and amortized separately.\n\nThe rights of use relating to leases as defined by IFRS 16 are recorded on the balance sheet at the lease contract conclusion for the discounted value of future lease payments. Contracts within the scope of IFRS 16 are mainly related to real estate leases (land and buildings). The terms selected generally correspond to the firm duration of the contract unless an intention to renew or terminate the contract is known. The Group applies the two exemptions provided for by the standard (leases of less than 12 months and leases for low-value assets).\n\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. No residual value is taken into account, except for aircraft.\n\nDepreciation and amortization periods depend on their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each year-end for material assets.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 38 \"Intangible Assets\" concerning development costs, the Group determines the development phase of its programs that meets the criteria for capitalization. Development costs are capitalized if they satisfy the following three determining criteria:\n\n- the technical criterion is met when the period for validation of results after the maiden flight has elapsed without questioning the project,\n- the economic criterion is validated by the orders placed or options obtained on the date the technical criterion is considered satisfied,\n- the financial information reliability criterion is satisfied for significant programs because the information system differentiates between research and development phases. If such a distinction cannot be made, as may be the case for minor developments (e.g. modification, improvement, etc.), those development costs are not capitalized.\n\nThe asset must generate clearly identifiable future economic benefits attributable to a specific product.\n\nCapitalized development costs are valued at the production cost. They are amortized on the basis of the number of aircraft delivered during the year, divided by an estimated number of aircraft to be delivered under the program.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Useful lives**\n\nInitial useful lives are determined as follows:\n\n| Software                            | 3-4 years                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Development costs                   | depend on the number of units to be produced |\n| Industrial buildings                | 20-25 years                                  |\n| Office buildings                    | 20-25 years                                  |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 7-15 years                                   |\n| Plant, equipment and machinery      | 3-10 years                                   |\n| Aircraft                            | 4-15 years                                   |\n| Rolling stock                       | 4 years                                      |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3-10 years                                   |\n| Used property                       | on a case-by-case basis                      |\n| Rights of use                       | based on the duration of each lease contract |\n\nThe initial useful life of an asset is extended or reduced if the conditions in which the asset is used justify it.\n\n### **1.8.3. Impairment and recoverable value of intangible assets, plant, property and equipment and goodwill**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 \"Impairment of Assets,\" all non-current assets (tangible and intangible) and goodwill are subject to an impairment test when an indication of impairment is detected, and at least once a year on December 31 for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.\n\nIndications of impairment derive from significant adverse changes of a lasting nature, affecting the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used by the Group.\n\nImpairment tests consist in ensuring that the recoverable values of the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is assigned are at least equal to their net book value. Otherwise, impairment is recognized in net income and the net book value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable value.\n\nThe recoverable value of property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is the higher value between its fair value, less the costs of disposal, and its value in use.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit corresponds to its value in use. Each consolidated company represents a cash-generating unit, i.e. the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and outflows.\n\nThe value in use is calculated using the discounted future cash flow method. Discount rates are reviewed each year. As of December 31, 2023, the Group's after-tax discount rate was 9.8% (9.9% as of December 31, 2022). Value in use is determined on the basis of projected after-tax cash flows resulting from economic assumptions and estimated operating conditions used by Management and takes into account a terminal value.\n\nWhen a cash-generating unit needs to be impaired, the impairment is first of all applied to the goodwill then, if appropriate, to the other assets of the cash-generating unit proportionate to their net book value. Impairments may be reversed, except for those relating to goodwill.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.4. Equity associates**\n\nInvestments in equity associates undergo an impairment test once there are objective indications of any long-term loss in value.\n\nAn impairment is recognized if the recoverable value is lower than the carrying value, with the recoverable value being equivalent to the value in use, as defined in paragraph 1.8.3., or the fair value net of transaction costs, whichever is higher.\n\nConcerning the equity investment in Thales, when an impairment test is carried out, the operational and financial assumptions used come directly from data provided by Thales management.\n\nAn impairment may be reversed if the recoverable value once again exceeds the carrying value.\n\n### **1.8.5. Other non-current financial assets**\n\n#### **Non-listed securities and Embraer shares**\n\nThese securities are recognized at their fair value.\n\nIn the absence of any external valuation elements, the fair value of unconsolidated investments, non-listed, represents the share in net assets (calculated based on the most recent financial statements available at the time of accounting) plus any significant unrealized gains or it is based on the discounted future cash flow method (see note 1.8.3). These items are classified as level 3 (according to IFRS 13).\n\nThe fair value of Embraer shares corresponded to the market price as of the balance sheet date. These items were classified as level 1 (according to IFRS 13). The Embraer shares were sold in 2023.\n\nChanges in fair value and gains or losses on disposal for these securities are recognized under other income and expenses directly recorded through equity, without any impact on income or loss. Only dividends continue to be recorded in income.\n\n#### **Other non-current financial assets**\n\nOther financial assets mainly comprise advance lease payments, loans granted to investments and loans granted to employees for a housing loan. Loans are recorded at amortized cost (historical cost less repayments). Other assets are recorded at their historical cost.\n\nOther non-current financial assets also include Dassault Aviation's investments in investment funds, including the aeronautical investment fund, valued at fair value through income or loss.\n\n### **1.8.6. Inventories and work-in-progress**\n\nIncoming raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods inventories are measured at acquisition cost for items purchased and production cost for items produced. Outgoing inventories are valued at the weighted average cost, except for used aircraft which are stated at acquisition cost. Work-in-progress is stated at production cost and does not include abnormal production costs.\n\nInventories and work-in-progress are impaired when their net realizable value is less than their carrying amount.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs for completion and making the sale. It takes into account the technical or commercial obsolescence of articles and the risks associated with their low turnover.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.7. Contract assets and liabilities**\n\nFor a given contract, the amount of cumulative revenue accounted for in respect of all performance obligations, less payments received and trade receivables which, in the balance sheet, are booked separately, is recognized under contract assets or contract liabilities.\n\n### **1.8.8. Receivables**\n\nA receivable is an unconditional right to payment by the customer. Trade receivables include receivables arising from finance leases. These represent the discounted amount of the expected lease revenues, plus the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the finance lease.\n\nA provision for impairment is recorded when the recoverable value of a receivable is lower than the book value.\n\nThe recoverable value of a receivable is estimated based on expected losses and takes into account the type of customer and the history of payments.\n\nThe receivable is impaired up to the amount of the estimated risk for the portion not covered by credit insurance (Bpifrance Assurance Export or collateral).\n\nNon-impaired receivables are recent receivables and/or receivables with no material credit risk.\n\nForeign currency receivables, translated by each subsidiary into their local currency at the day's rate, are revalued at each closing on the basis of the closing rate. Revaluation differences are recognized in operating income.\n\n### **1.8.9. Other current financial assets**\n\nOther current financial assets mainly consist of time deposits at more than 3 months, debt securities and cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nThe time deposits and debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, as the Group does not intend to convert these investments into cash in the short term for operational purposes. Other investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe associated financial results are presented as income from other financial assets within net financial income.\n\n### **1.8.10. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents satisfy the criteria set forth in IAS 7, \"Statement of Cash Flows\": short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are not subject to a material risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with a maturity of less than three months and cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nThe time deposits are recorded at amortized cost and the cash investments in the form of marketable securities are measured at fair value in the income statement.\n\nThe associated financial results are presented as income from cash and cash equivalents within net financial income.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.8.11. Treasury shares**\n\n### **Treasury shares**\n\nTreasury shares are deducted from equity at their acquisition cost. Any gains or losses from the sale of treasury shares are recognized directly in equity and do not contribute to the income for the fiscal year.\n\n### **Share-based payments**\n\nDassault Aviation has settled plans to grant performance shares. These allotments are recognized as an expense representing the fair value of the services rendered by the beneficiaries.\n\nThe fair value of the services is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares on the grant date, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period.\n\nThe performance conditions are taken into account when estimating the number of shares to be granted at the end of the vesting period.\n\nThe benefits granted constitute personnel expenses and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This expense is recognized against consolidated reserves.\n\n### **1.8.12. Provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n### **Provisions for warranties and other contract risks**\n\nDassault Aviation has formal obligations under sales or procurement contracts relating to the equipment, products and/or services delivered (software development, systems integration, etc.).\n\nThese obligations can be distinguished between:\n\n- \"current\" warranty: repair of defective equipment during the contractual warranty period or by implicit obligations, handling hardware or software malfunctions identified following qualification and handover to users, etc.,\n- \"regulatory\" warranty: treatment by the manufacturer of any changes to the regulatory framework determined by the regulatory authorities or any regulatory non-compliance identified by the manufacturer or a user after delivery of materials or products,\n- other risks in connection with the performance of the contract.\n\nThe amount of the provisions is mainly determined as follows:\n\n- on the basis of feedback on the costs incurred,\n- on the basis of quotes provided by specialists in the relevant fields.\n\n### **Retirement costs**\n\nCommitments to employees for retirement costs are measured using the projected unit credit method. The commitments are estimated for all employees on the basis of vested rights (based on the employee's length of service at the end of the period relative to total career expectancy) and a projection of current salaries, after taking into account the mortality risk, employee turnover, and a discounting assumption. The rates used have been determined based on the yield for top-ranking corporate longterm bonds, with maturity equivalent to the duration of the calculated liabilities.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group applies the revised IAS 19 which stipulates:\n\n- the recognition of all actuarial adjustments in income and expense recognized directly through equity,\n- immediate recognition of the cost of past services,\n- alignment of the expected return from the plan's assets to the discount rates,\n- the recognition of the sole administrative costs relating to management of the assets as a deduction from their actual return.\n\nThe provision or asset that appears in the balance sheet corresponds to the total commitment net of plan assets. The impact on the income statement is fully recognized in operating income.\n\n### **1.8.13. Borrowings and payables**\n\nForeign currency borrowings and payables, translated by each subsidiary into their local currency at the day's rate, are revalued at each closing based on the closing rate. Revaluation differences are recognized in operating income.\n\nLoans taken out by the Group are initially recorded at the amount received net of transaction costs, and subsequently at the amortized cost, calculated using the effective interest rate.\n\nLease liabilities relating to leases as defined by IFRS 16 are recognized on the balance sheet at the origin of the lease for the discounted value of future payments.\n\n### **1.8.14. Discounting of receivables, payables and provisions**\n\nReceivables and payables are recognized for their discounted amounts when the payment date is more than one year and the effects of the discounting are significant.\n\nThe provision relating to retirement severance payments and related benefits is discounted in accordance with IAS 19 \"Employee Benefits\" and the lease liabilities are discounted in accordance with IFRS 16 \"Leases.\"\n\nOther provisions are stated at their current value.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n### **1.8.15. Derivative financial instruments**\n\n### **Derivative financial instruments subscribed by the Group**\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nExchange rate risks mainly arise from US dollar-denominated sales. The corresponding future cash flows are partially hedged using forward exchange contracts and currency options.\n\n### **Evaluation and recognition of derivatives**\n\nUpon initial recognition, derivatives are booked at acquisition cost in the balance sheet under \"Derivative Financial Instruments.\"\n\nThey are subsequently stated at fair value, calculated on the basis of the market price communicated by the relevant financial institutions and the market parameters observed on the closing date, taking into account any counterparty risks. The valuation of financial instruments is level 2 (according to IFRS 13).\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting when the criteria defined by IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" are met. Foreign exchange derivatives are documented, on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of spot or forward prices.\n\nDerivatives eligible for hedge accounting are recognized as follows:\n\n- changes in fair value of hedging instruments are posted, net of tax, to other income and expense recognized through equity, with the exception of the ineffective amount of the hedge, if any, which is recognized in income,\n- when the cash flow is received, the gain or loss on the foreign exchange hedging instrument is recognized in income.\n\nIf a derivative, chosen for the effectiveness of the economic hedging it provides to the Group, does not meet the conditions required by the hedge accounting standard (foreign exchange options), then changes in its fair value are recognized in financial income.\n\n### **1.8.16. Net sales and income**\n\n### **Recognition of net sales and operating income**\n\nThe results on completion are based on estimates of net sales and costs at completion (taking into account the program departments' forecasts) which are revised as the contract progresses and take into account the latest known events at the closing date. The potential losses on completion are recognized as soon as they are known.\n\n### Sale of goods\n\nNet sales and net income are recognized over time if the transfer of control of goods is gradual and at a point in time otherwise.\n\nFor the majority of its contracts, the IFRS 15 criteria for the recognition of revenue over time are not met, in particular for Rafale and Falcon sales whose alternative use could be demonstrated. Revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are delivered in the majority of cases.\n\nFinance leases are recognized as credit sales in application of IFRS 16, \"Leases.\"\n\n#### Sale of services\n\nRevenue from performance of services is recognized over time, if the criteria of IFRS 15 are met, as it is the case for maintenance contracts. The percentage-of-completion method used by the Group will be the cost-to-cost method: whereby revenue is recognized based on costs incurred at a given date divided by total costs expected at completion.\n\nServices for which the criteria of IFRS 15 are not met, as is the case for certain development contracts, are recognized at the end of the service provided.\n\n#### Agent / principal\n\nContracts involving co-contractors and for which Dassault Aviation is the sole signatory are analyzed to determine the Company's status as a principal or agent. If the analysis classifies the Company as an agent, only the proportionate share of net sales due to the agent is recognized. Otherwise, the entirety of net sales and related expenses (including the share attributable to co-contractors) is recognized.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Backlog\n\nThe backlog presented in note 24 corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations on the closing date.\n\n### **Government grants**\n\nResearch tax credits are included in operating income in \"other revenue\" when obtaining them does not depend on the realization of a tax profit.\n\n### **Net financial income/expense**\n\nNet financial income/expense primarily represents:\n\n- financial income related to cash and cash equivalents and other current and non-current financial assets,\n- financial expenses related to loans taken out by the Group and locked-in employee profit-sharing funds,\n- the financing component when there is, for a given contract, a significant difference between the moment when the cash is received and the moment when the revenue is recognized,\n- interest expenses related to lease liabilities under IFRS 16,\n- dividends from non-consolidated companies,\n- financial income from finance lease contracts,\n- losses and gains on derivative instruments that do not meet the conditions required by the standard for hedge accounting.\n\n### **1.8.17. Deferred tax**\n\nDeferred taxes linked to temporary differences are calculated per company.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 \"Income Taxes,\" deferred tax assets are only recognized, for each company, insofar as the estimated future income is sufficient to cover these assets and their maturity does not exceed ten years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is paid, based on local tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted by year-end.\n\nTaxes on items recognized directly through equity are charged or credited to equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset per entity for presentation on the balance sheet.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 2 - Scope of consolidation**\n\n### **2.1. Scope as of December 31, 2023**\n\nDassault Aviation is a French group that designs and manufactures military aircraft, business jets and space systems.

Provisions for retirement severance payments**\n\n### **12.3.1. Description of the plans**\n\nThe plans set up are either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.\n\n### **Defined-contribution plans**\n\nIn certain countries, the Group pays contributions bases on salaries to state organizations overseeing basic pension schemes (e.g., *Securité Sociale* or the compulsory supplementary schemes ARRCO and AGIRC in France). These plans do not impose any obligations on the Group other than the payment of contributions: there is no related benefit obligation and contributions are expensed in the period they are incurred.\n\nAmounts paid represent EUR -127,896 thousand in 2023 and EUR -112,942 thousand in 2022.\n\n#### **Defined-benefit plans**\n\nDefined-benefit plans relate to different types of benefits:\n\n- pensions and end-of-career indemnities (legal or contractual), and other long-term benefits (jubilee awards, etc.), particularly in France;\n- supplementary pension schemes, mainly in the United States providing the payment of an annuity. This plan was frozen as at December 31, 2021 and was replaced by a defined-contribution plan.\n\nThese commitments are partially covered by plan assets. A provision is recognized if the value of the assets is insufficient to cover the obligations.\n\n### **12.3.2.

Cash and liquidity risks**\n\n### **23.1.1. Financial debts**\n\nThe Group has no significant risk in relation to its financial debt. A description of the financial debts appears in note 11.\n\n### **23.1.2. Cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets**\n\nThe Group has a solid financial structure and works only with top-tier banks.\n\nThe Group investment portfolio is primarily composed of time deposits and money market investments with no significant risk of impairment.\n\n| (in EUR thousands)                                                   | Market value | %    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand, money market investments and time deposits | 5,990,274    | 81%  |\n| Investments in bonds and other debt securities                       | 770,691      | 11%  |\n| Unspecified investments                                              | 610,595      | 8%   |\n| Total                                                                | 7,371,560    | 100% |\n\nA full analysis of the performance of investments is performed at each closing date. The investment portfolio does not show, line-by-line, any objective indication of significant impairment as of December 31, 2023 (as was the case on December 31, 2022).\n\nThese investments could be converted into cash depending on Group's operational purposes. Cash resources and its portfolio of marketable securities therefore allow the Group to meet its commitments without any liquidity risk. The Group is not faced with restrictions with regard to the availability of its cash and its portfolio of marketable securities.\n\n### **23.2. Credit and counterparty risks**\n\n#### **23.2.1. Credit risk on bank counterparties**\n\nThe Group allocates its investments and performs its cash and foreign exchange transactions with recognized financial institutions. The Group has no investments or accounts with financial institutions presenting a significant risk of default.\n\n#### **23.2.2. Customer default risk**\n\nThe Group limits counterparty risk by conducting most of its sales in cash and ensuring that the loans are secured by export insurance guarantees (Bpifrance Assurance Export) or collaterals. The share of receivables not covered by these procedures is subject to regular individual monitoring and, if necessary, a provision for impairment.\n\nGiven the arrangements in risk mitigation that are in place, and the provisions made in its accounts, the Group's residual exposure to the risk of default by a customer in a country subject to uncertainties is limited.\n\nThe Bpifrance Assurance Export guarantees and collateral obtained and not exercised as of the closing date are of the same nature as those as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe amount of Bpifrance Assurance Export guarantees and collaterals obtained and not exercised at year-end appears in the table of off-balance sheet commitments (see note 24).\n\nThe manufacturing risk is also guaranteed with Bpifrance Assurance Export for major military export contracts.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **23.3. Other market risks**\n\n### **23.3.1. Foreign exchange risk**\n\nThe Group covers risks from exchange rates using derivative financial instruments whose book value is presented below:\n\n| (in EUR thousands)                   | 12/31/2023 |             | 12/31/2022 |             |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Assets     | Liabilities | Assets     | Liabilities |\n| Exchange rate derivatives            | 58,694     | 29,440      | 23,086     | 111,019     |\n| Net derivative financial instruments | 29,254     |             |            | 87,933      |\n\nThe Group is exposed to a foreign exchange risk through the parent company in relation to its Falcon sales, which are mainly denominated in US dollars. This risk is partially hedged by using forward currency contracts and foreign exchange options.\n\nThe Group partially hedges its cash flows that are considered highly probable. It ensures that the initial future cash flows will be sufficient to use the foreign exchange hedges in place. The hedged amount may be adjusted in accordance with changes over time in expected net cash flows.\n\nThis risk is permanent, taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and volatility.

consolidated financial statements)<br><br>Dassault Aviation provides warranties for its aircraft deliveries against hardware or software defects and is required to correct any regulatory non-compliance identified after the delivery of the equipment. These warranties therefore constitute a commitment for the Company. The costs of this commitment must be provisioned upon delivery of the airplane.<br><br>The estimated amount of the provisions is based on the data and expenses recorded by airplane model and type of transactions warrantied and on estimated costs, in particular cost estimates for specialists, handling of malfunctions and regulatory non-compliance. Given the fleet in service and the variety of costs potentially incurred, provisions for warranties are determined by complex models that require judgments by several Operational Departments.<br><br>Management's valuation of these commitments caused Dassault Aviation to recognize provisions for warranties of EUR 878.6 million as at December 31, 2023.<br><br>The valuation of these provisions is a key point of the audit due to:<br>• the high level of judgment required for their determination,<br>• the complex nature of their valuation,<br>• their significant amount,<br>• and, consequently, the potentially significant impact on earnings and consolidated equity if their estimates vary. | On the basis of discussions with the relevant operational departments, we took note of the procedures to identify the risks to be guaranteed and the procedures put in place to determine the costs and other data used as a basis for the valuation of provisions for guarantees. We also tested the functioning of key controls that we considered relevant to our audit.<br><br>In addition, our work consisted of:<br>• assessing the adequacy of the funding methodology used by the Group's management and the judgments exercised by it,<br>• assessing, through discussions with the relevant operational departments, the reasonableness of the main assumptions used to determine provisions for guarantees,<br>• randomly testing the source data and observed costs used for the valuation of the provisions and the accuracy of the calculations made. |\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the board of directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial performance declaration required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report. Pursuant to Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. A report will be issued on this information by an independent third-party.\n\n#### **Other verification or information stipulated in Legal and Regulatory documents**\n\n#### *Annual accounts lay-out to be included in the annual financial report*\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Group Managing Director, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation n° 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limits inherent in the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we have no responsibility to verify that the annual accounts that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n#### *Appointment of the Statutory Auditors*\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Dassault Aviation Company by the General Meetings held on June 19, 1990 for Mazars and held on May 12, 2020 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs at December 31 2023, audit firm Mazars and audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit were in the 34th year and 4th of total uninterrupted engagement respectively.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were closed by the board of directors\n\n### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n### *Objectives and audit approach*\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n### *Report to the Audit Committee*\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N°537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. When appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nLes Commissaires aux comptes\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Mazars\n\nMazars\n\nEdouard Demarcq Erwan Candau\n\nErwan Candau\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThe statutory auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes explanatory paragraphs discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThis report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Financial statements parent company as of December 31,

General principles**\n\n### **1.1.1. General basis**\n\nThe financial statements of the Parent Company as of December 31, 2023 were closed by the board of directors on March 5, 2024, and will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024. The company financial statements are prepared in accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-03 on the French General Accounting Plan, which has since been updated by a series of amending regulations and by the subsequent opinions and recommendations of the French Accounting Standards Authority.\n\nThe methods used to present the financial statements are comparable year-on-year.\n\nThe general accounting conventions have been applied, in compliance with the principle of prudence, and in line with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- going concern of operations,\n- permanence of the accounting methods from one year to the next,\n- independence of fiscal years,\n\nand in line with the general rules for the establishment and presentation of annual financial statements. The individual financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost.\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could have an impact on the amounts reported in the balance sheet and in the income statement. Those estimates concern, in particular:\n\n- the results of contracts in progress,\n- the calculation of provisions for contingencies and charges and of impairments.\n\nThese estimations are calculated by taking into account past experience, items known at the closing date and any reasonable change assumptions. Subsequent results may therefore differ from such estimates.\n\n### **1.1.2. Impact of the global geopolitical context**\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which Russia started on February 24, 2022, triggered a major crisis in the aviation sector, leading to shortages and putting significant pressure on supplies. The risk is that it could have a lasting impact on the Company and its partners, sub-contractors and customers. The regulations adopted by the European Union and the United States are strictly enforced by the Company, especially the ban on commercial transactions and the restriction on financial transactions with sanctioned persons or entities. Some entities in the maintenance network in Europe have been significantly affected by the loss of Russian customers. Operations in Russia, the Moscow office and the Dassault Falcon Service maintenance subsidiary, have stopped doing business.\n\nAs of December 31, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.2. Valuation principles**\n\n#### **1.2.1. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition or production cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization and impairment. Interest expense is not capitalized.\n\nEach identified component of an intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment is recognized and depreciated or amortized separately.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. No residual value is taken into account, except for aircraft.\n\nDepreciation and amortization periods depend on their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each year-end for material assets. The initial useful life of an asset is extended or reduced if the conditions in which the asset is used justify it.\n\nInitial useful lives are determined as follows:\n\n| Software                            | 3-4 years               |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Industrial buildings                | 20-25 years             |\n| Office buildings                    | 20-25 years             |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 7-15 years              |\n| Plant, equipment and machinery      | 3-10 years              |\n| Aircraft                            | 10-15 years             |\n| Rolling stock                       | 4 years                 |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3-10 years              |\n| Used property                       | on a case-by-case basis |\n\n### **1.2.2. Impairment of assets**\n\nThe Company conducts an impairment test if an indication of loss of value has been detected. Indications of impairment come from significant long-term adverse changes that affect the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used by the Company.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are impaired by the Company when the net carrying amount exceeds their current value. The amount of impairment recognized in income is equal to the difference between the net carrying amount and current value. The current value of an asset is the higher of its market value (less selling costs) and its value in use.\n\nThe value in use is calculated using the discounted future cash flow method. Discount rates are reviewed each year. As of December 31, 2023 the after-tax discount rate was 9.8% (9.9% as of December 31, 2022). The value in use is determined on the basis of projected after-tax cash flows resulting from economic assumptions and estimated operating conditions used by Management and takes into account a terminal value.\n\n#### **1.2.3. Associates and other investment securities**\n\nGross values are represented by the purchase cost excluding incidental charges, except in the case of those subject to the 1976 legal revaluation. An impairment is recognized when the book value is lower than the gross value. The book value is the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nDassault Aviation assesses the book value for listed investment securities on the basis of the average quotation for the reporting month and for non-listed securities, in the absence of any external valuation elements, according to the share in net assets or the discounted cash flow method.\n\nConcerning the equity investment in Thales, when an impairment test is carried out, the operational and financial assumptions used come directly from data provided by Thales management.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.2.4. Inventories and work-in-progress**\n\nIncoming raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods inventories are measured at acquisition cost for items purchased and production cost for items produced. Outgoing inventories are valued at the weighted average cost, except for used aircraft which are stated at acquisition cost. Work-in-progress is stated at production cost and does not include abnormal production costs.\n\nInventories and work-in-progress are impaired when their net realizable value is less than their carrying amount.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs for completion and making the sale. It takes into account the technical or commercial obsolescence of articles and the risks associated with their low turnover.\n\n### **1.2.5. Receivables**\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is recognized when the recoverable value is lower than the carrying amount. The Company did not have to recognize any significant provisions, since its military trade receivables are represented by government customers and the vast majority of Falcon's sales are in cash.\n\n#### **1.2.6. Borrowings**\n\nBorrowings are recorded at the amount received. Transaction costs are posted to expenses for the year.\n\n### **1.2.7. Regulated provisions**\n\nRegulated tax provisions appearing on the balance sheet include provisions for price increases and depreciation by derogation.\n\n### **1.2.8. Provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n#### **Warranty provisions and other contract risks**\n\nDassault Aviation has formal obligations under sales or procurement contracts relating to the equipment, products and/or services delivered (software development, systems integration, etc.).\n\nThese obligations can be distinguished between:\n\n- \"current\" warranty: repair of defective equipment during the contractual warranty period or based on a constructive obligation, correcting hardware or software malfunctions identified following qualification and handover to users, etc.,\n- \"regulatory\" warranty: implementation by the manufacturer of any changes to the regulatory framework determined by the regulatory authorities or any regulatory non-compliance identified by the manufacturer or a user after delivery of equipment or products,\n- other risks in connection with the performance of the contract.\n\nThe amount of the provisions is mainly determined as follows:\n\n- on the basis of feedback on the costs incurred,\n- on the basis of quotes provided by specialists in the relevant fields.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Retirement payments and related benefits**\n\nA provision for remaining obligations of commitments to employees for retirement payments and related benefits is recorded. The commitments are estimated for all employees on the basis of vested rights and a projection of current salaries, after taking into account the mortality risk, employee turnover, and a discounting assumption. The rates used have been determined based on the yield for top-ranking corporate long-term bonds, with maturity equivalent to the duration of the calculated liabilities.\n\nActuarial gains or losses, or those gains or losses that are analyzed as such, are fully recognized in operating income in the period during which they are incurred. The provision that appears in the balance sheet is the amount of the total commitment net of outsourced amounts.\n\n### **1.2.9. Hedging instruments**\n\nThe Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nExchange rate risks mainly arise from US dollar-denominated sales. The corresponding future cash flows are partially hedged using forward exchange contracts and currency options.\n\nThe Company reviewed the highly probable nature of the flows associated with financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting and could find no evidence challenging this position at the end of December 2023.\n\nThe effects of the hedge, including the carrying forward/backwardation, are recorded at the rhythm of the hedged item and follow the same classification as the hedged item, i.e. the operating profit.\n\nPremiums paid or received on the potential purchase or sale of options are recognized as income only at the expiration of these options.\n\nHedging instruments that hedge balance sheet positions are accounted for in cash instruments.\n\n### **1.2.10. Foreign currency transactions**\n\nExpenses and income in foreign currencies are recognized at their equivalent value in euros on the date of the payment or settlement transaction, with the exception of the net flows associated with global foreign exchange hedging, which are recorded at the hedge rate for the year.\n\nCurrency receivables and payables outstanding at year-end are revalued into euros at the closing rate of exchange.\n\nWhen the application of the translation rate on the closing date has the effect of modifying the amounts in euros previously recognized, the currency translation differences are booked to transitory accounts:\n\n- under assets, when unrealized translation balance is a loss,\n- under liabilities, when unrealized translation balance is a gain.\n\nAn overall foreign exchange position is calculated by maturity of unhedged receivables and payables. When an overall foreign exchange position by maturity is an unrealized loss, a provision is set up for that risk.\n\nTranslation gains and losses arising on cash at bank and in hand as of December 31 are recognized on the income statement.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.2.11. Net sales and income**\n\nThe results on completion are based on estimates of net sales and costs at completion (taking into account the program departments' forecasts). These are revised as the contracts progress and take into account the latest known events at the closing date. The potential losses on completion are recognized as soon as they are known.\n\n### **Sales of goods and development contracts**\n\nNet sales and net income are recognized when Dassault Aviation has transferred the main risks and benefits of ownership to the buyer, and it is probable that the future economic benefits will benefit the Company.\n\nAs a general rule, net sales are recognized upon delivery of goods or development services. The corresponding costs are valued on the basis of net income at completion estimated in the contract. If the estimated costs are lower than the actual costs, the difference is classified as work-in-progress. If the estimated costs are higher than the actual costs, a provision for services and work still to be performed is recognized at closing.\n\n### **Other service contracts**\n\nIncome from sales of services is recognized under the percentage of completion method according to the milestones set forth in contracts. Income or loss is recognized at each stage of completion if it can be reliably measured.\n\nContracts involving co-contractors for which Dassault Aviation is the only signatory are recognized for the entire amount of net sales and related expenses (including the co-contractors' share).\n\n### **1.2.12. Marketable securities and cash instruments**\n\nThe item includes deposits with over three months term and debt securities which the Company does not intend to convert into cash in the short term for operational purposes. The item also includes cash investments in the form of marketable securities.\n\nUnrealized capital gains on marketable securities are not recognized in the income statement until effectively realized. The tax charge relating to unrealized gains is recorded under prepayments until the gain is recognized in financial income.\n\nThis method, which constitutes an exception to the general principle of full recognition of deferred taxes, has been adopted to provide a fairer presentation of the Company's results.\n\nUnrealized capital losses on marketable securities are subject to a provision.\n\n### **1.2.13. Treasury shares**\n\nThe book value of treasury shares at year-end is determined by the average market price in the month before closing. If the market price is lower than the purchase value, an impairment is recorded, with the exception of securities being canceled or shares held for allotment under a defined plan.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.3. Tax consolidation**\n\nThe Company opted for the tax consolidation scheme in 1999, pursuant to Articles 223-A and following of the French General Tax Code. As of January 1, 2012, the tax consolidation scope of the Group includes Dassault Aviation, Dassault Aéro Service and Dassault Aviation Participations.\n\nThis tax consolidation arrangement is tacitly renewable per period of five fiscal years.\n\nBy agreement, it does not have an impact on the results of consolidated companies: tax liabilities are borne by the tax group companies as if no tax consolidation existed.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 2 - Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\n### **2.1.

Details of provisions for contingencies and charges**\n\n(1) provisions for retirement payments and related benefits:\n\nRetirement payment commitments are calculated for all employees using the projected unit credit method. They are provisioned in full for the remaining obligations.\n\nEmployment projections are weighted using French insurance code mortality rates and the recorded employee turnover rate (this may vary according to age). The obligation depends on the employee's length of service at the end of the period relative to total career expectancy (see Note 1.2.8 of the valuation principles).\n\nThe calculation takes into account the following annual assumptions: discount rate of 2.6% and inflation rate of 2.4%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balance of the provision for long-service awards was EUR 3.1 million.\n\n(2) provisions for warranties and other contract risks:\n\nProvisions are updated to reflect changes to the fleet in service, deliveries during the period and contractual obligations induced by the execution of contracts.\n\n{268}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Note 15 -

also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law.\n\n### *Information given in the management report and in the other documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements*\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the board of directors and in the other documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n### *Report on corporate governance*\n\nWe attest that the board of directors report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code relating to remunerations and benefits received or attributed to the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nConcerning the information related to factors that your company have considered as likely to have an impact in case of a public takeover or swap bid, given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have verified its conformity with the source documents which we were provided. Based on this work, we have no remarks to make on this information.\n\n### *Other Information*\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n### **Other verification or information stipulated in Legal and Regulatory documents**\n\n#### *Annual accounts lay-out to be included in the annual financial report*\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Group Managing Director, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation n° 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Appointment of the Statutory Auditors*\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Dassault Aviation Company by the General Meetings held on June 19, 1990 for Mazars and held on May 12, 2020 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, audit firm Mazars and audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit were in the 34th year and 4th of total uninterrupted engagement respectively.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the board of directors.\n\n#### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**\n\n#### *Objectives and audit approach*\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or taken together, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n#### *Report to the Audit Committee*\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee that includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement which, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N°537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de Déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nFait à Neuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La Défense, March 12, 2024\n\nLes Commissaires aux comptes\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Mazars\n\nEdouard Demarcq Erwan Candau\n\nErwan Candau\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThe statutory auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the financial statements.\n\nThis report also includes information relating to the specific verifications of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Photos**\n\nCover (photos): © Dassault Aviation - Airborne Films/A.
