This year, fraught with difficult challenges, has been yet another test of our ability to be resilient, thrive in the face of adversity and emerge stronger.\n\n2023 was marked by a complex and unstable geopolitical landscape, characterised by international conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Palestine, as well as tensions between the Western powers and China.\n\n## **Increased production costs**\n\nThese international conflicts and geopolitical tensions have impacted the environment, causing high market volatility, volatile costs, as well as serious tensions in global supply chains, especially in terms of raw materials and energy.\n\n### **Evolution in the price of CO2 emission allowances**\n\nAs in previous years, the price of CO2 emission allowances increased during 2023. This trend is a result of growing concern surrounding climate change and the measures being taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis has prompted companies in the sector to invest in more efficient and sustainable technologies in order to cut their emissions and meet customers' growing demand for sustainable products. In fact, an increasing number of manufacturers are launching products with low CO2 emissions.\n\nFrom Tubos Reunidos' perspective as a manufacturer, consolidating our steelworks has also served to significantly reduce our carbon footprint and CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, mitigating the risk of this price increase.\n\n### **Sectoral concentration**\n\nThe sector is becoming more concentrated, some companies are acquiring distributors, processing plants and key assets to strengthen their position in key markets. Other companies are abandoning Europe.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy**\n\nThe EU is promoting the European Green Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, through the Taxonomy Regulation. This regulation classifies economic activities according to six environmental objectives. Companies must assess whether their activities are within the scope of the taxonomy and whether they meet the technical criteria. The taxonomy establishes three key performance indicators for non-financial entities, based on business information, CapEx (capital expenditure) and OpEx (operating expenditure). These reflect the potential and actual sustainability of the activities.\n\nIn 2023, we carried out an analysis for our activities in comparison to the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation. All companies of the consolidated Tubos Reunidos Group were included in scope. As stated in the regulation, we have studied the eligibility and alignment of the two climate objectives (mitigation and adaptation).\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" and \"CONTENTS\" in white font on a green background.

The image is cropped in a circle.\n\n**Josu Calvo** Chairman\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nIt is my pleasure to write to you and share an update on Tubos Reunidos' performance and reflect on the challenges and successes we have seen over the last year. This period has been marked by significant changes and challenges, but also by remarkable achievements that reinforce our commitment to the growth of the group, people and sustainability.\n\nThe current geopolitical environment, marked by international conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Palestine, has created a backdrop of uncertainty that has affected all sectors, including our company. These conflicts have led to an increase in production costs due to high energy prices, supply shortages and logistical difficulties.\n\nDespite these adversities, this year Tubos Reunidos has achieved an EBITDA of EUR 106 million and a net profit of EUR 54 million, demonstrating, once again, that it is capable of adapting and being resilient. For more than a century we have been able to react quickly to changes in the environment — and this year has been no exception. The strength of our organisation lies in our ability to make quick and effective decisions, which has allowed us not only to overcome challenges, but to also seize emerging opportunities in the market — all while becoming stronger and maintaining sustainable growth that is testament to our strength and long-term vision.\n\nSustainability is a key pillar in our corporate and commercial strategy. Our commitment to decarbonisation and sustainable production is an added bonus that is becoming increasingly valued within the market and sets us apart from our competitors. That's why we are working to be become pioneers in the manufacture of low-emission pipes. Our goal is to be able to offer a range of climate-neutral products, which would involve bringing to market an option that currently does not exist and that would be the culmination of our sustainability efforts. This approach not only responds to market demands, but also demonstrates our responsibility to the environment and future generations.\n\nIn light of this, and as part of our strategy to optimise and strengthen operations, in 2023 we combined the Sestao and Amurrio steelworks into a single facility in Amurrio. During this process, we reused as many materials and as much equipment as possible from Sestao, in turn contributing to the circular economy. Doing this has allowed us to increase production capacity and leverage similarities between the manufacture of ingots and billets, making the facility more efficient while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We are now able to offer a greater variety of products meaning that we can meet market demands more quickly and efficiently.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn this journey towards sustainable and emission-free products, people are our greatest asset. Our employees' knowledge and dedication are the heart and soul of Tubos Reunidos. We are therefore focusing on attracting and retaining talent by creating a stimulating, stable and safe work environment that allows our employees to develop their maximum potential.\n\nWe are also immersed in a digital transformation process. Digitalising our organisational and production processes allows us to improve efficiency and reduce costs, while liberating the workforce from repetitive tasks so that they can focus on higher value-added activities. This digitalisation process is combined with reinforced cybersecurity, guaranteeing that our systems, processes and data are protected, and maintaining our customers' trust.\n\nIn line with our strategy, our values and market demand, we have set ambitious ESG (*Environmental, Social and Governance*) targets to contend with the challenges that lie ahead. Some of our diverse initiatives include: certifying the environmental footprint of our products and implementing improvements to support our customers on their journey towards decarbonisation, so that we become a strategic partner in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint; implementing measures to increase safety and prevent the occupational risks linked to our activity; establishing procedures for efficiently managing resources, including adopting circular economy practices and; continuing to strengthen our corporate governance policies to ensure that all our operations are transparent and ethical.\n\nAll of our progress and achievements over the last few years allow us to look to the future with optimism and determination. We are in a strong position to aspire to be one of the market leaders in the manufacture of climate-neutral seamless steel tubes, and therefore, become **pioneers for an emission-free future.** \n\nFinally, we would like to express our sincerest gratitude to all the people who form part of the Tubos Reunidos team. Your commitment has been crucial to our collective success.\n\nWe would also like to thank you for the trust you have placed in our group, as well as that of the other shareholders, the Board of Directors, customers, suppliers, institutions and all the organisations that in one way or another support us in our day to day. Thanks to all of you, Tubos Reunidos continues to grow and has now turned 131, but this is just the beginning. We are confident that, together, we will write the story of a company that will become a future international leader.\n\nKind regards,\n\n**Josu Calvo** Chairman\n\n**Carlos López de las Heras** CEO\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/12 description: Three workers wearing orange hard hats and ear protection are standing in front of a white board.

We work closely with our customers to identify energy-saving opportunities and develop customised solutions that meet their specific needs.\n\nIn 2022, we developed a customised pricing system, which was adjusted to our business process, as well communication channels to enable us to be more available for customers and better understand their needs. Following this milestone, we implemented a robust business strategy in 2023, which included geographic repositioning and premium products. We also developed a comprehensive new tool to study and analyse claims that allows us to offer fast and effective solutions. In fact, last year we received 119 complaints, all of which were handled and closed without any breaches. What's more, none were related to regulatory breaches.\n\nOur profound technical knowledge coupled with an unwavering commitment to sustainability and our electric arc furnace manufacturing process enables us to offer our customers innovative piping solutions that not only meet their technical needs, but also reduce their Scope 3 carbon emissions and contribute towards a greener future.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/4 description: A close-up shot captures a person using a grinder on a metal surface, creating a shower of sparks.

Several key projects have been carried out in this regard in 2023:\n\n## **1. Plant digitalisation:**\n\nWe have implemented a number of services aimed at optimising operations through the use of digital tools. This includes the creation of a data lake to store and analyse data related to the production process, as well as the adoption of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. We have also used tools such as Celonis for data-mining and Bichange to optimise energy consumption.\n\n### **2. New advanced production control systems:**\n\nWe are developing a new MES (Manufacturing Execution System) in Trápaga to improve the traceability of products in the rolling process. This project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, which will allow us to have greater traceability over manufactured products.\n\n# **3. Improvements in production management and control:**\n\nOver the past year we have made significant improvements in various aspects of operational management, including machinery controls, preventive maintenance planning, consumables inventory and defect management. Furthermore, technological improvements have been implemented for the preparation of manufacturing orders and for greater flexibility in the planning system.\n\n## **4. Other projects:**\n\nThe corporate intranet has been redesigned to improve day-to-day management. This change has been accompanied by training in digital tools to facilitate the digital transition.\n\nThese projects reflect a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/11 description: The image shows a green lightbulb with a yellow-green leaf inside.

In line with our commitment to sustainability, we carried out a Double Materiality Analysis in 2023, taking into account the requirements established by the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and the ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) of the EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group), with which we must be compliant by 2025 in our 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\nThe objective of double materiality is to identify the topics that are relevant for our business from among those proposed by the CRSD, and to study them from two perspectives:\n\n**Impact materiality:** This evaluates the real or potential impacts, both positive or negative, of our activities on people and the environment in the short-, medium- and long-term. This includes both our internal operations and the entire value chain.\n\n**Financial materiality:** This includes sustainability aspects that create risks or corporate opportunities for the Group's value, by positively (opportunity) or negatively (risk) influencing our financial position.\n\nThe double materiality matrix, outlined on the next page, is crucial for identifying impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) and determining their importance, highlighting milestones in our *Sustainability Master Plan* and, therefore, in our *Strategic Plan*.\n\nFollowing the Double Materiality analysis, 17 topics were identified, which were then analysed from the double perspective of impact and financial materiality.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/8 description: The image shows a green outlined shield with a rounded top and a yellow check mark inside.

The data points are scattered across the plot, with some points closer to the \"High financial materiality\" and \"High impact materiality\" labels.\n\nTopics considered in the\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/4 description: The image shows a table with three columns labeled E, S, and G. The E column lists environmental factors such as energy, adaptation to climate change and lower emissions, air pollution, soil contamination, water management, resource use, waste management and the circular economy, and biodiversity and natural capital. The S column lists social factors such as talent management and working conditions, occupational health and safety, value chain, contribution to society and relationship with local communities, and customer relationships. The G column lists governance factors such as business ethics and governance, business risk management, corruption, bribery and money laundering, cybersecurity and data processing, and digitalization and innovation.\n\nImpact materiality\n\n\\*Non-material topics\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Sustainability at Tubos Reunidos\n\nThe steel sector plays a crucial role in the global economy, although it is known to be one of the main emitters of greenhouse gases. In 2019, the sector's direct carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions reached 2.6 gigatonnes, accounting for approximately 7% of all emissions generated by energy-related activities worldwide.\n\nAware of the importance of addressing these challenges, we have intensified our efforts to develop a *Sustainability Master Plan* throughout 2023. This plan will cover all environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) challenges, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the responsible development of our activities.\n\nAdditionally, in line with this strategy we have requested our adherence to the United Nations Global Compact for Sustainability.\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for \"The Global Compact\". The logo features a globe with lines of latitude and longitude, surrounded by the text \"THE GLOBAL COMPACT\" in a circular arrangement. Below the globe, there are two laurel branches.

Inside the leaf, there are two yellow curved arrows forming a circle.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Circular economy model**\n\nWe stand out as a model of circularity when designing production processes with a clear focus on reducing the environmental impact associated with the consumption of natural raw materials. As managers of scrap metal waste, we fully contribute to minimising the impact of our activity by using this as a raw material when manufacturing steel in an electric furnace.\n\nSince 2017 we have participated in the Circular Economy Pact, promoted by UNESID (*Unión de Empresas Siderúrgicas de España* — Spanish union of steel companies), committing ourselves to work towards a circular model.\n\nThroughout 2023, as in 2022, 75% of the materials used in our production process were renewable, according to GRI standards.\n\nWe are designing our own tool to calculate our organisational carbon footprint. Its development and implementation will be detailed in the future *Sustainability Master Plan*.\n\nWe are implementing initiatives such as the Verticero project to valorise refractory waste; the ECOD2D4.0 project to research and develop products for the construction of digitalised eco-roads and; we are collaborating with companies in the sector to valorise white slag, minimising its environmental impact.\n\nThe next key objective is to design the strategy to analyse and measure our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nFurthermore, our Transforma 360° project, launched in 2017, identifies actions for improvement and evaluates their impact on sustainability objectives. In 2023, we worked on 22 process-optimisation initiatives, applying existing technologies to valorise waste for our activity or that of others.\n\n## **Decarbonisation as a central pillar**\n\nWe recognise our responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are working to achieve ambitious and necessary targets to mitigate the impact we generate. We manufacture more efficient and environmentally friendly technology, such as electric arc furnaces (EAF), thus significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions compared to blast furnace steel production.\n\nThe *Sustainability Master Plan* will prioritise energy efficiency initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe are working on a life cycle analysis for the pipes produced. The result of this analysis serves as a starting point for our internal working groups, called ESG, who use the results to develop improvement action plans aligned with reduction targets.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of energy efficiency, we have implemented measures such as oxygen enrichment in hearth furnaces, heat recovery in electric furnaces and the initiation of a plan to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in internal forklifts at factories, with our first biogas forklift. We are also developing big data and artificial intelligence projects to improve product quality and efficiency. As regards sustainable mobility, we encourage private car sharing and have installed chargers for electric vehicles at our factories.\n\n### **Sustainable water management**\n\nWe foster a culture of responsible water consumption, using closed-circuit industrial water recirculation to reduce consumption. In 2023, we recirculated 19,598,177 m<sup>3</sup> , down 25% from the previous year, mainly due to the decrease in production at Amurrio. Led by the Sustainability Division, we will develop a *Sustainable water management plan* to reduce the use of catchment water, improve the quality of wastewater and optimise treatment and purification processes.\n\n### **Air quality**\n\nWe tightly control emissions of polluting gases in accordance with environmental regulations. We take continuous measurements, in compliance with the Integrated Environmental Authorisation. As regards noise pollution, we carry out periodic checks to ensure that noise is within the established limits.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/6 description: The image shows a green and yellow icon of the Earth with a sprout growing out of the top.

IN THIS SENSE, WE CONTRIBUTED EUR 131,000 TO DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT 2023.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Health and safety**\n\nOur employees' health and safety are key priorities for us and are included in both our Double Materiality Analysis and *Strategic Plan*. We collaborate with specialist authorities and entities to align policies and procedures with regulations and best practices. We have worked with experts to develop training programmes and assessment tools to improve occupational health and safety performance.\n\nWe have spent three years working on the Excellence in Safety Project, training our professionals to lead actions aimed at meeting safety-related objectives in the workplace.\n\nHighlights of 2023 include the *10 rules that save lives*, a set of preventive standards for the work environment; the visitor leaflet, a clear guide to rules for external visitors; as well as the various activities carried out during the European Week for Health and Safety at Work, reinforcing awareness of occupational health and safety.\n\nWe have also implemented tools such as safety dialogues and pre-shift talks to promote a culture of safety. What's more, we have established a specific process for obtaining work permits in particularly dangerous situations.\n\nLast year, we unified prevention services across our plants to improve efficiency, and created health and safety control mechanisms for subcontracted companies. Our Health and Safety Committees meet regularly to identify incidents and monitor ongoing actions.\n\nAs health and safety training is ongoing, we hold regular meetings with Project Management and prevention officers in order to keep them informed of progress in this regard.\n\n# **OUR PRINCIPLES**\n\n- 1. Health and safety as values, with the goal of \"zero accidents\" and always working safely.\n- 2. Committed Management overseeing health and safety as a business aspect.\n- 3. Health and safety as a premise in all decisions taken.\n- 4. All staff trained in occupational health and safety, as well as training for and inclusion of suppliers and contractors.\n- 5. Compliance with current legislation, achieving objectives and obtaining health and safety certifications.\n- 6. Commitment to the community and the environment.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **People and well-being, our fundamental pillar**\n\nWe promote the professional development and quality of life of our employees and their families through actions such as educational support for employees' children; facilitating travel from Bilbao to Amurrio; offering a pension plan with contributions to social welfare entities; prioritising internal mobility; participating in company benefits and having life insurance to provide security in the event of unforeseen events. In fact, in 2023, we contributed EUR 2,848,000 to the pension plan and we now have 1243 members.\n\n## **We drive talent**\n\nAt the heart of our company, we recognise that talent is the blend of three fundamental pillars: Knowledge, Will and Power.\n\nKnowledge represents ability, combining knowledge, skills, experience and aptitude at work; Will is manifested in commitment to our strategic objectives, driving attitude and motivation at work; while Power is the action itself, the ability to solve problems and assume responsibilities.\n\nWe aim to enhance these capabilities within our team through our Individual Development and Management Programme. This is brought to life through various actions focused on both the organisational structure and the individual.\n\nWe devised a Job Map of the Functional and Skills Profile for the Role (known as the PFCC), which is a strategic tool that guides our talent management.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/8 description: A man in an orange hard hat, safety glasses, and ear protection is standing outside with his arms crossed. He is wearing a blue shirt and an orange vest. There are some industrial buildings in the background.\n\nIdentifying key positions allows us to accurately structure succession and hiring plans, supported by descriptions and success profiles.\n\nOur Compensation Policy is designed to attract and retain the best talent available in the market, while also reinforcing our professionals' loyalty. We have also initiated training and professional development pathways, as well as 360° Assessments to boost personal and professional growth.\n\nTraining is a constant investment. In the last year alone, we have dedicated EUR 229,000 and more than 12,000 hours to training programmes. In tandem to this, applying the management by objectives (MBO) approach for the whole workforce focuses individual performance towards strategic goals, generating accountability and progress.\n\nOur commitment to the next generation of talent is embodied by the Cantera Programme, which offers comprehensive support to young talent during their early professional experiences. This programme includes development workshops, specialised projects and mentors assigned to facilitate their integration and growth.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" with a logo on the left and a double right arrow on the right.\n\nEssentially, our comprehensive approach to talent development not only strengthens our current teams, but also lays the foundations for a strong and promising future.\n\n## **Equality, diversity and inclusion**\n\nWe promote gender equality and diversity in our work environment. We do not discriminate based on gender in our recruitment processes. Remuneration is established in accordance with the job category, removing any potential for pay discrimination.\n\nWe have an Equality Plan in place (2023–2027) in all our plants, thus strengthening our organisational culture and ensuring that each employee feels valued. We advocate for respect for diversity in all its forms.\n\nIn collaboration with UNESID, we are continuing with the \"Women of Steel\" programme, highlighting the female role in the steel and metallurgical industry and participating in discussion forums on equality.\n\nWe are aware of the challenges faced by people with functional diversity and, as such, we are collaborating with special employment centres.

BARANGO S.L. has been incorporated into the Barandiarán Group Concerted Action.\n\n\\*\\* As at the date of issue of this Report, BBVA holds an indirect stake of 5.21% of share capital.\n\nIn relation to the list of the significant shareholders of the Company, we must report that, in January 2023, the company was notified of the dissolution and liquidation of the company Elguero, S.A., which as of 31 December 2022 directly held a significant stake of 3.33% of share capital. After the aforementioned dissolution and liquidation, the 5,819,474 shares in Tubos Reunidos S.A. held by Elguero S.A. were distributed equally among the four partners of the company, the Ybarra Aznar siblings, with each receiving 25%.\n\n## **Structure of the management body**\n\nAs communicated to the market via Inside Information Communication dated 14 July 2023, the Board of Directors of Tubos Reunidos S.A. acknowledged on that date the notification sent on 13 July 2023 by Mr Francisco Irazusta Rodriguez, in which he communicated his voluntary resignation as Executive Chairman of the Company and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective from 31 August 2023, to take on a new professional challenge at an international company outside Spain.\n\nIn accordance with the Tubos Reunidos S.A. Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, from 31 August 2023 when Mr Irazusta effectively resigned from his duties, Deputy Chair Emilio Ybarra Aznar temporarily took over duties as chair until a new non-executive chair of the Board of Directors was appointed, and Mr Carlos López de las Heras remained on the executive management team as Managing Director.\n\nOn 27 June 2023, the Board of Directors formally approved the separation of the posts of non-executive chairman and chief executive, in line with best good corporate governance practice and with the aim of strengthening the Board of Directors' independence.\n\nMr Josu Calvo Moreira was appointed independent director at the Company by co-optation on 21 December 2023, as well as non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors. The market\n\nwas notified of this by means of a communication of Other Relevant Information on 21 December. Tubos Reunidos, S.A. therefore strengthened its Board of Directors and its corporate governance model with a non-executive chairman, in order to navigate the demanding challenges facing the Group in the coming years. Mr Josu Calvo Moreira does not have any executive powers at Tubos Reunidos and retains his current position as CEO of Gonvarri Industries.\n\nThe Board of Directors expressly thanked the Deputy Chairman Mr Emilio Ybarra Aznar for his huge contribution to the Company when temporarily acting as Chairman.\n\nCurrently, the governing body of Tubos Reunidos, S.A. is its Board of Directors. In accordance with the provisions of the By-laws, the Board of Directors must be formed of a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 14 members. On 31 December 2023, the aforementioned Board was composed of 11 directors, distributed as follows:\n\n- 6 independent directors\n- 5 proprietary directors\n\nAt the date of issue of this document, the Board of Directors of Tubos Reunidos S.A. is made up of the following directors:\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# TUBOS REUNIDOS S.A.

All resolutions of the Board were made unanimously.\n\nIn 2023, the average remuneration for male directors was EUR 100,714 and for female directors EUR 68,125 (in 2022, it was EUR 153,561 for male directors and EUR 58,570 for female directors). The disparity in remuneration is because until 31 August 2023 compensation for the executive director was considerably higher than for other members.\n\nApplication of the Directors' Remuneration Policy, which is permanently published on the corporate website, aims to generate long-term value for shareholders and, in turn, ensure the long-term sustainability of the Company's results and activity. The compensation established in favour of the directors is based on the usual remuneration items for boards of listed Spanish companies.\n\nThe Annual Board Remuneration Report will be submitted as a separate item of the Agenda, to advisory vote of the General Meeting. This report is available to shareholders and investors on the Company's corporate website (www.tubosreunidosgroup.com) and on the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) portal (www.cnmv.es).\n\nAt a meeting held on 3 June 2009, the Board of Directors unanimously resolved to create a Delegated Committee. During 2023, the Delegated Committee did not hold any meetings. At the end of the 2023, the Delegated Committee was made up of the following Board members:\n\nProprietary Director Independent Director\n\n## DELEGATE COMMITTEE\n\n**Mr Josu Calvo Moreira** Chairman\n\n**Mr Jorge Gabiola Mendieta** Member\n\n**Mr Enrique Migoya Peláez** Member\n\n**Mr Cristóbal Valdés Guinea** Member\n\n**Mr Emilio Ybarra Aznar** Member\n\n**Ms Inés Núñez de la Parte** Secretary\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/39/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" with a logo on the left.

The Meeting was broadcast live via the corporate web portal, while shareholders were given the opportunity to exercise their representation and voting rights via telematic means prior to the Meeting being held.\n\nDuring the Meeting, shareholders had the power to exercise their political rights in full, in accordance with the following aspects:\n\n- All shareholders have the right to attend the Meeting, regardless of the number of shares they hold.\n- Each share grants the right to one vote.\n- Under all circumstances, resolutions are adopted in accordance with the majorities established in the Capital Companies Act.\n\nThe attendance records for both those who attended the General Shareholders' Meetings in person and those who were represented for the last three financial years are shown below:\n\n**June 2021 — 47.38% October 2021 — 47.71%\\* December 2021 — 46.72%\\* June 2022 — 46.97% June 2023 — 41.20%**\n\n\\*Extraordinary meetings\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **System for good governance, risk management and regulatory compliance**\n\nAt Tubos Reunidos, we see commitment to good corporate governance as not only an obligation, but a fundamental pillar of our business strategy. Standing firm in its belief that transparent and responsible management is key to generating sustainable value, the Board of Directors has fostered a process for continuous improvement in this regard, positioning the company as a benchmark in the sector.\n\nOur firm commitment is reflected in our high levels of compliance with good governance recommendations, as endorsed by external evaluations. However, at Tubos Reunidos we do not settle for what we have already achieved. Aware of the importance of constant evolution, we have set as a strategic objective to adopt the best practices recommended by the *Unified code of good governance for listed companies* published in June 2020.\n\nThe Board of Directors continued to make progress in continuously improving corporate governance throughout 2023, with the aim of establishing a robust Corporate Governance System consistent with best practices. The main objective is to foster and maintain a corporate culture rooted in ethics and a commitment to sustainable development.\n\nIn this regard, on 21 December 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new regulation for the corporate body, specifically the Audit Committee Regulations. With a view to promoting sustainable and ethical business development, 2023 also saw the approval of new corporate policies such as:\n\n- The *Information security policy*, approved on 27 April, which forms part of the Company's Internal Control and Risk Management System.\n- The *Corporate procurement, service contracting and investments policy*, approved on 27 July.\n\nThe following strategic actions should also be highlighted:\n\n- Approval of the basic structure and general lines of the future *Sustainability Master Plan* for a 5-year period (2024–2028) on 21 December, establishing it as one of the foundations of the organisation's Strategic Plan.\n- Increased resources for the Sustainability Department.\n\nApproval of the updated Corporate Risk Map on 27 July, which reorganises risks and gives greater importance to cyber risks and sustainability, among others.\n\nThe Tubos Reunidos Group has continued to demonstrate its commitment to ethics, integrity and good governance throughout 2023, strengthening its Regulatory Compliance System.\n\nMatters related to ethics, integrity and good governance are centralised through our Regulatory Compliance System, which has a set of procedures designed to prevent, identify and correct unwanted behaviour.\n\nAfter consultation with employees' legal representatives, in 2023 the Board of Directors comprehensively reviewed and reformed the compliance system, so that it can be adapted by the deadline to the requirements of the new Act 2/2023 of 20 February on the Protection of Persons who Report Regulatory Violations and the Fight Against Corruption.\n\nIn 2023 we implemented and circulated an internal information system designed, established and managed in a secure way, which:\n\n- a) Ensures the confidentiality of whistleblowers' and third parties' identity mentioned in the communication, as well as the actions undertaken, ensures data protection, preventing access by unauthorised employees.\n- b) Allows communication to be submitted in writing or verbally, or both.\n- c) Integrates the various internal information channels.\n- d) Establishes guarantees to protect whistleblowers.\n- e) Has an established procedure for handling information received.\n\nTherefore, on 25 July 2023, the Board of Directors obtained a certificate of adequacy for the compliance system and its correct adaptation to the new legislation.\n\nThe comprehensive reform of the compliance system was communicated transparently to shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 29 June 2023, as item 9 under 'Matters for information'. In particular, shareholders were\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo with the letters 'TR' inside a green globe, followed by the text '2023 ANNUAL REPORT' and 'CONTENTS >>'.\n\ninformed of the reporting channels available to them for communicating any actions or omissions within the Tubos Reunidos Group of which they are aware and may constitute serious or very serious criminal or administrative violations, including those involving financial losses for the Public Treasury and/or Social Security.\n\nReform of the Compliance System required the following specific actions by the Board in 2023:\n\n- 1) Appointment on 30 March of the Secretary of the Board of Directors as System Manager for the Whistleblowing System (which forms part of the compliance system).\n- 2) Approval of the new Code of Ethical Conduct for the Tubos Reunidos Group on 25 May, with a new revised text adapted to new Act 2/2023, replacing and overriding the previous one approved in April 2021.\n- 3) Approval on 25 May of the *Corporate Policy on the Whistleblowing System and the Protection of the Whistleblower,* which sets out the general principles relating to the Internal Reporting System and has been duly published within the organisation.\n- 4) Approval on 25 May of the *Regulation on the Whistleblowing Channel*, which include the *Privacy policy* and the *Protocol prohibiting retaliation* as appendices. The Regulation and its appendices constitute the new information management procedure, replacing the *Whistleblowing channel regulations* approved in April 2021.\n- 5) Approval on 25 May of the new IMB Regulations, replacing those adopted on 29 April 2021.\n- 6) Approval 25 May of the new *Gifts and invitations policy*, which replaces the one approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 7) Approval on 29 June of a new *Corporate criminal risk prevention and compliance policy* adapted to Law 2/2023, replacing the policy approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 8) Approval on 29 June of a new *Criminal risk prevention manual* (general section) adapted to Law 2/2023, replacing the manual approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 9) Three additional documents remained at Audit Committee level and were overseen with a favourable opinion in July:\n- *Criminal risks prevention manual* (Specific Section).\n- *Ethical commitment of directors, executives and employees*.\n- Review of the adaptation of the new ethical commitment models.\n- 10) Approval on 21 December of the *Code of ethical conduct for suppliers of the Tubos Reunidos Group*.\n\nLikewise, the Board of Directors supervised the *Protocol for prevention and action against harassment* adapted to new Act 2/2023 on 21 December, with regard to duties in the field of compliance and approval of its implementation in 2024 at all Group companies. It is testament to the Group's commitment to zero tolerance of harassment. Anti-corruption measures have also been implemented, including specific training for HR personnel and the prohibition of practices such as bribery and money laundering. The Group reaffirms its commitment to the defence of Human Rights, both in its own operations and throughout its supply chain.\n\nThe new Whistleblowing Channel, which was updated in 2023, provides a safe and confidential way to report ethical or legal violations, demonstrating the Group's firm commitment to transparency and integrity. Although no reports have been received regarding sensitive matters such as corruption or human rights violations, the channel's existence reinforces the culture of compliance and responsibility within the organisation.\n\nIn fact, through its Regulatory Compliance System and its Code of Ethical Conduct, the Tubos Reunidos Group reaffirms its commitment to responsible behaviour, legality, respect for human rights and integrity in all its operations.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have a comprehensive Risk Management System applicable to all Group companies, as set out in the Corporate Risk Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2021.\n\nIn accordance with current regulations, Tubos Reunidos has detailed the risk management system implemented by the Company in the Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) for the 2023 financial year. This report specifies which bodies are responsible for formulating and implementing this system, as well as the main risks that could affect the achievement of business objectives and the level of tolerance established in this regard.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the management team manage the risks in order to reasonably guarantee that the entity achieves its objectives. This approach aims to provide an adequate level of security for various different stakeholders, including the market in general, in order to reasonably safeguard the value generated. The Risk Management System is constantly evolving and improving under the Group's responsibility.\n\nThe risk matrix of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) enables the company to identity the substantial elements of the financial statements, the statements or objectives of the financial information that is susceptible to risks, as well as to prioritise the operational processes that affect the financial information. This structure is to be reviewed annually in accordance with the plans established by the Group. During the 2023 financial year, the Group's ICFR was updated in response to organisational changes (included in the Steering Committee) and structural adjustments (business mergers between Group companies).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Royal Decree Law 18/2017, of 24 November, which transposes Directive 2014/95/EU into Spanish law, and the Law on Non-Financial Information and Diversity of 28 December 2018, in 2023 Tubos Reunidos prepared and published its Non-Financial Reporting Statement. This document contains the necessary information to understand the Group's performance, results and situation, as well as the impact of its activities in relation to environmental aspects, social aspects, human rights, the fight against corruption and bribery, as well as aspects relating to staff. This report has been verified by an independent verification service provider (E&Y), who issued a favourable opinion.\n\nThe actions carried out in the key areas, together with important reforms carried out in previous years (such as System reformulation in 2022 around ESG criteria), make the Tubos Reunidos Group's Corporate Governance System robust and effective. It provides a solid structure for conducting business, complying with the highest standards and best practices both nationally and internationally.\n\nThroughout 2024, the Tubos Reunidos Group will continue its commitment to continuously improve its corporate governance system.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Share price status and evolution**\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Relevant data**\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Tubos Reunidos' share capital stood at EUR 3,493,617.76, represented by 174,680,888 shares, each with a nominal value of EUR 0.02.\n\nThese shares are listed on the stock exchanges in Bilbao and Madrid.

This period has been marked by significant changes and challenges, but also by remarkable achievements that reinforce our commitment to the growth of the group, people and sustainability.\n\nThe current geopolitical environment, marked by international conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Palestine, has created a backdrop of uncertainty that has affected all sectors, including our company. These conflicts have led to an increase in production costs due to high energy prices, supply shortages and logistical difficulties.\n\nDespite these adversities, this year Tubos Reunidos has achieved an EBITDA of EUR 106 million and a net profit of EUR 54 million, demonstrating, once again, that it is capable of adapting and being resilient. For more than a century we have been able to react quickly to changes in the environment — and this year has been no exception. The strength of our organisation lies in our ability to make quick and effective decisions, which has allowed us not only to overcome challenges, but to also seize emerging opportunities in the market — all while becoming stronger and maintaining sustainable growth that is testament to our strength and long-term vision.\n\nSustainability is a key pillar in our corporate and commercial strategy. Our commitment to decarbonisation and sustainable production is an added bonus that is becoming increasingly valued within the market and sets us apart from our competitors. That's why we are working to be become pioneers in the manufacture of low-emission pipes. Our goal is to be able to offer a range of climate-neutral products, which would involve bringing to market an option that currently does not exist and that would be the culmination of our sustainability efforts. This approach not only responds to market demands, but also demonstrates our responsibility to the environment and future generations.\n\nIn light of this, and as part of our strategy to optimise and strengthen operations, in 2023 we combined the Sestao and Amurrio steelworks into a single facility in Amurrio. During this process, we reused as many materials and as much equipment as possible from Sestao, in turn contributing to the circular economy. Doing this has allowed us to increase production capacity and leverage similarities between the manufacture of ingots and billets, making the facility more efficient while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We are now able to offer a greater variety of products meaning that we can meet market demands more quickly and efficiently.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn this journey towards sustainable and emission-free products, people are our greatest asset. Our employees' knowledge and dedication are the heart and soul of Tubos Reunidos. We are therefore focusing on attracting and retaining talent by creating a stimulating, stable and safe work environment that allows our employees to develop their maximum potential.\n\nWe are also immersed in a digital transformation process. Digitalising our organisational and production processes allows us to improve efficiency and reduce costs, while liberating the workforce from repetitive tasks so that they can focus on higher value-added activities. This digitalisation process is combined with reinforced cybersecurity, guaranteeing that our systems, processes and data are protected, and maintaining our customers' trust.\n\nIn line with our strategy, our values and market demand, we have set ambitious ESG (*Environmental, Social and Governance*) targets to contend with the challenges that lie ahead. Some of our diverse initiatives include: certifying the environmental footprint of our products and implementing improvements to support our customers on their journey towards decarbonisation, so that we become a strategic partner in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint; implementing measures to increase safety and prevent the occupational risks linked to our activity; establishing procedures for efficiently managing resources, including adopting circular economy practices and; continuing to strengthen our corporate governance policies to ensure that all our operations are transparent and ethical.\n\nAll of our progress and achievements over the last few years allow us to look to the future with optimism and determination. We are in a strong position to aspire to be one of the market leaders in the manufacture of climate-neutral seamless steel tubes, and therefore, become **pioneers for an emission-free future.** \n\nFinally, we would like to express our sincerest gratitude to all the people who form part of the Tubos Reunidos team. Your commitment has been crucial to our collective success.\n\nWe would also like to thank you for the trust you have placed in our group, as well as that of the other shareholders, the Board of Directors, customers, suppliers, institutions and all the organisations that in one way or another support us in our day to day. Thanks to all of you, Tubos Reunidos continues to grow and has now turned 131, but this is just the beginning. We are confident that, together, we will write the story of a company that will become a future international leader.\n\nKind regards,\n\n**Josu Calvo** Chairman\n\n**Carlos López de las Heras** CEO\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/12 description: Three workers wearing orange hard hats and ear protection are standing in front of a white board.

This year, fraught with difficult challenges, has been yet another test of our ability to be resilient, thrive in the face of adversity and emerge stronger.\n\n2023 was marked by a complex and unstable geopolitical landscape, characterised by international conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Palestine, as well as tensions between the Western powers and China.\n\n## **Increased production costs**\n\nThese international conflicts and geopolitical tensions have impacted the environment, causing high market volatility, volatile costs, as well as serious tensions in global supply chains, especially in terms of raw materials and energy.\n\n### **Evolution in the price of CO2 emission allowances**\n\nAs in previous years, the price of CO2 emission allowances increased during 2023. This trend is a result of growing concern surrounding climate change and the measures being taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis has prompted companies in the sector to invest in more efficient and sustainable technologies in order to cut their emissions and meet customers' growing demand for sustainable products. In fact, an increasing number of manufacturers are launching products with low CO2 emissions.\n\nFrom Tubos Reunidos' perspective as a manufacturer, consolidating our steelworks has also served to significantly reduce our carbon footprint and CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, mitigating the risk of this price increase.\n\n### **Sectoral concentration**\n\nThe sector is becoming more concentrated, some companies are acquiring distributors, processing plants and key assets to strengthen their position in key markets. Other companies are abandoning Europe.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy**\n\nThe EU is promoting the European Green Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, through the Taxonomy Regulation. This regulation classifies economic activities according to six environmental objectives. Companies must assess whether their activities are within the scope of the taxonomy and whether they meet the technical criteria. The taxonomy establishes three key performance indicators for non-financial entities, based on business information, CapEx (capital expenditure) and OpEx (operating expenditure). These reflect the potential and actual sustainability of the activities.\n\nIn 2023, we carried out an analysis for our activities in comparison to the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation. All companies of the consolidated Tubos Reunidos Group were included in scope. As stated in the regulation, we have studied the eligibility and alignment of the two climate objectives (mitigation and adaptation).\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" and \"CONTENTS\" in white font on a green background.

We work closely with our customers to identify energy-saving opportunities and develop customised solutions that meet their specific needs.\n\nIn 2022, we developed a customised pricing system, which was adjusted to our business process, as well communication channels to enable us to be more available for customers and better understand their needs. Following this milestone, we implemented a robust business strategy in 2023, which included geographic repositioning and premium products. We also developed a comprehensive new tool to study and analyse claims that allows us to offer fast and effective solutions. In fact, last year we received 119 complaints, all of which were handled and closed without any breaches. What's more, none were related to regulatory breaches.\n\nOur profound technical knowledge coupled with an unwavering commitment to sustainability and our electric arc furnace manufacturing process enables us to offer our customers innovative piping solutions that not only meet their technical needs, but also reduce their Scope 3 carbon emissions and contribute towards a greener future.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/4 description: A close-up shot captures a person using a grinder on a metal surface, creating a shower of sparks.

Several key projects have been carried out in this regard in 2023:\n\n## **1. Plant digitalisation:**\n\nWe have implemented a number of services aimed at optimising operations through the use of digital tools. This includes the creation of a data lake to store and analyse data related to the production process, as well as the adoption of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. We have also used tools such as Celonis for data-mining and Bichange to optimise energy consumption.\n\n### **2. New advanced production control systems:**\n\nWe are developing a new MES (Manufacturing Execution System) in Trápaga to improve the traceability of products in the rolling process. This project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, which will allow us to have greater traceability over manufactured products.\n\n# **3. Improvements in production management and control:**\n\nOver the past year we have made significant improvements in various aspects of operational management, including machinery controls, preventive maintenance planning, consumables inventory and defect management. Furthermore, technological improvements have been implemented for the preparation of manufacturing orders and for greater flexibility in the planning system.\n\n## **4. Other projects:**\n\nThe corporate intranet has been redesigned to improve day-to-day management. This change has been accompanied by training in digital tools to facilitate the digital transition.\n\nThese projects reflect a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/11 description: The image shows a green lightbulb with a yellow-green leaf inside.

In line with our commitment to sustainability, we carried out a Double Materiality Analysis in 2023, taking into account the requirements established by the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and the ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) of the EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group), with which we must be compliant by 2025 in our 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\nThe objective of double materiality is to identify the topics that are relevant for our business from among those proposed by the CRSD, and to study them from two perspectives:\n\n**Impact materiality:** This evaluates the real or potential impacts, both positive or negative, of our activities on people and the environment in the short-, medium- and long-term. This includes both our internal operations and the entire value chain.\n\n**Financial materiality:** This includes sustainability aspects that create risks or corporate opportunities for the Group's value, by positively (opportunity) or negatively (risk) influencing our financial position.\n\nThe double materiality matrix, outlined on the next page, is crucial for identifying impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) and determining their importance, highlighting milestones in our *Sustainability Master Plan* and, therefore, in our *Strategic Plan*.\n\nFollowing the Double Materiality analysis, 17 topics were identified, which were then analysed from the double perspective of impact and financial materiality.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/8 description: The image shows a green outlined shield with a rounded top and a yellow check mark inside.

The data points are scattered across the plot, with some points closer to the \"High financial materiality\" and \"High impact materiality\" labels.\n\nTopics considered in the\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/4 description: The image shows a table with three columns labeled E, S, and G. The E column lists environmental factors such as energy, adaptation to climate change and lower emissions, air pollution, soil contamination, water management, resource use, waste management and the circular economy, and biodiversity and natural capital. The S column lists social factors such as talent management and working conditions, occupational health and safety, value chain, contribution to society and relationship with local communities, and customer relationships. The G column lists governance factors such as business ethics and governance, business risk management, corruption, bribery and money laundering, cybersecurity and data processing, and digitalization and innovation.\n\nImpact materiality\n\n\\*Non-material topics\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Sustainability at Tubos Reunidos\n\nThe steel sector plays a crucial role in the global economy, although it is known to be one of the main emitters of greenhouse gases. In 2019, the sector's direct carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions reached 2.6 gigatonnes, accounting for approximately 7% of all emissions generated by energy-related activities worldwide.\n\nAware of the importance of addressing these challenges, we have intensified our efforts to develop a *Sustainability Master Plan* throughout 2023. This plan will cover all environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) challenges, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the responsible development of our activities.\n\nAdditionally, in line with this strategy we have requested our adherence to the United Nations Global Compact for Sustainability.\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for \"The Global Compact\". The logo features a globe with lines of latitude and longitude, surrounded by the text \"THE GLOBAL COMPACT\" in a circular arrangement. Below the globe, there are two laurel branches.

Inside the leaf, there are two yellow curved arrows forming a circle.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Circular economy model**\n\nWe stand out as a model of circularity when designing production processes with a clear focus on reducing the environmental impact associated with the consumption of natural raw materials. As managers of scrap metal waste, we fully contribute to minimising the impact of our activity by using this as a raw material when manufacturing steel in an electric furnace.\n\nSince 2017 we have participated in the Circular Economy Pact, promoted by UNESID (*Unión de Empresas Siderúrgicas de España* — Spanish union of steel companies), committing ourselves to work towards a circular model.\n\nThroughout 2023, as in 2022, 75% of the materials used in our production process were renewable, according to GRI standards.\n\nWe are designing our own tool to calculate our organisational carbon footprint. Its development and implementation will be detailed in the future *Sustainability Master Plan*.\n\nWe are implementing initiatives such as the Verticero project to valorise refractory waste; the ECOD2D4.0 project to research and develop products for the construction of digitalised eco-roads and; we are collaborating with companies in the sector to valorise white slag, minimising its environmental impact.\n\nThe next key objective is to design the strategy to analyse and measure our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nFurthermore, our Transforma 360° project, launched in 2017, identifies actions for improvement and evaluates their impact on sustainability objectives. In 2023, we worked on 22 process-optimisation initiatives, applying existing technologies to valorise waste for our activity or that of others.\n\n## **Decarbonisation as a central pillar**\n\nWe recognise our responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are working to achieve ambitious and necessary targets to mitigate the impact we generate. We manufacture more efficient and environmentally friendly technology, such as electric arc furnaces (EAF), thus significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions compared to blast furnace steel production.\n\nThe *Sustainability Master Plan* will prioritise energy efficiency initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe are working on a life cycle analysis for the pipes produced. The result of this analysis serves as a starting point for our internal working groups, called ESG, who use the results to develop improvement action plans aligned with reduction targets.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of energy efficiency, we have implemented measures such as oxygen enrichment in hearth furnaces, heat recovery in electric furnaces and the initiation of a plan to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in internal forklifts at factories, with our first biogas forklift. We are also developing big data and artificial intelligence projects to improve product quality and efficiency. As regards sustainable mobility, we encourage private car sharing and have installed chargers for electric vehicles at our factories.\n\n### **Sustainable water management**\n\nWe foster a culture of responsible water consumption, using closed-circuit industrial water recirculation to reduce consumption. In 2023, we recirculated 19,598,177 m<sup>3</sup> , down 25% from the previous year, mainly due to the decrease in production at Amurrio. Led by the Sustainability Division, we will develop a *Sustainable water management plan* to reduce the use of catchment water, improve the quality of wastewater and optimise treatment and purification processes.\n\n### **Air quality**\n\nWe tightly control emissions of polluting gases in accordance with environmental regulations. We take continuous measurements, in compliance with the Integrated Environmental Authorisation. As regards noise pollution, we carry out periodic checks to ensure that noise is within the established limits.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/6 description: The image shows a green and yellow icon of the Earth with a sprout growing out of the top.

IN THIS SENSE, WE CONTRIBUTED EUR 131,000 TO DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT 2023.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Health and safety**\n\nOur employees' health and safety are key priorities for us and are included in both our Double Materiality Analysis and *Strategic Plan*. We collaborate with specialist authorities and entities to align policies and procedures with regulations and best practices. We have worked with experts to develop training programmes and assessment tools to improve occupational health and safety performance.\n\nWe have spent three years working on the Excellence in Safety Project, training our professionals to lead actions aimed at meeting safety-related objectives in the workplace.\n\nHighlights of 2023 include the *10 rules that save lives*, a set of preventive standards for the work environment; the visitor leaflet, a clear guide to rules for external visitors; as well as the various activities carried out during the European Week for Health and Safety at Work, reinforcing awareness of occupational health and safety.\n\nWe have also implemented tools such as safety dialogues and pre-shift talks to promote a culture of safety. What's more, we have established a specific process for obtaining work permits in particularly dangerous situations.\n\nLast year, we unified prevention services across our plants to improve efficiency, and created health and safety control mechanisms for subcontracted companies. Our Health and Safety Committees meet regularly to identify incidents and monitor ongoing actions.\n\nAs health and safety training is ongoing, we hold regular meetings with Project Management and prevention officers in order to keep them informed of progress in this regard.\n\n# **OUR PRINCIPLES**\n\n- 1. Health and safety as values, with the goal of \"zero accidents\" and always working safely.\n- 2. Committed Management overseeing health and safety as a business aspect.\n- 3. Health and safety as a premise in all decisions taken.\n- 4. All staff trained in occupational health and safety, as well as training for and inclusion of suppliers and contractors.\n- 5. Compliance with current legislation, achieving objectives and obtaining health and safety certifications.\n- 6. Commitment to the community and the environment.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **People and well-being, our fundamental pillar**\n\nWe promote the professional development and quality of life of our employees and their families through actions such as educational support for employees' children; facilitating travel from Bilbao to Amurrio; offering a pension plan with contributions to social welfare entities; prioritising internal mobility; participating in company benefits and having life insurance to provide security in the event of unforeseen events. In fact, in 2023, we contributed EUR 2,848,000 to the pension plan and we now have 1243 members.\n\n## **We drive talent**\n\nAt the heart of our company, we recognise that talent is the blend of three fundamental pillars: Knowledge, Will and Power.\n\nKnowledge represents ability, combining knowledge, skills, experience and aptitude at work; Will is manifested in commitment to our strategic objectives, driving attitude and motivation at work; while Power is the action itself, the ability to solve problems and assume responsibilities.\n\nWe aim to enhance these capabilities within our team through our Individual Development and Management Programme. This is brought to life through various actions focused on both the organisational structure and the individual.\n\nWe devised a Job Map of the Functional and Skills Profile for the Role (known as the PFCC), which is a strategic tool that guides our talent management.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/8 description: A man in an orange hard hat, safety glasses, and ear protection is standing outside with his arms crossed. He is wearing a blue shirt and an orange vest. There are some industrial buildings in the background.\n\nIdentifying key positions allows us to accurately structure succession and hiring plans, supported by descriptions and success profiles.\n\nOur Compensation Policy is designed to attract and retain the best talent available in the market, while also reinforcing our professionals' loyalty. We have also initiated training and professional development pathways, as well as 360° Assessments to boost personal and professional growth.\n\nTraining is a constant investment. In the last year alone, we have dedicated EUR 229,000 and more than 12,000 hours to training programmes. In tandem to this, applying the management by objectives (MBO) approach for the whole workforce focuses individual performance towards strategic goals, generating accountability and progress.\n\nOur commitment to the next generation of talent is embodied by the Cantera Programme, which offers comprehensive support to young talent during their early professional experiences. This programme includes development workshops, specialised projects and mentors assigned to facilitate their integration and growth.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" with a logo on the left and a double right arrow on the right.\n\nEssentially, our comprehensive approach to talent development not only strengthens our current teams, but also lays the foundations for a strong and promising future.\n\n## **Equality, diversity and inclusion**\n\nWe promote gender equality and diversity in our work environment. We do not discriminate based on gender in our recruitment processes. Remuneration is established in accordance with the job category, removing any potential for pay discrimination.\n\nWe have an Equality Plan in place (2023–2027) in all our plants, thus strengthening our organisational culture and ensuring that each employee feels valued. We advocate for respect for diversity in all its forms.\n\nIn collaboration with UNESID, we are continuing with the \"Women of Steel\" programme, highlighting the female role in the steel and metallurgical industry and participating in discussion forums on equality.\n\nWe are aware of the challenges faced by people with functional diversity and, as such, we are collaborating with special employment centres.

BARANGO S.L. has been incorporated into the Barandiarán Group Concerted Action.\n\n\\*\\* As at the date of issue of this Report, BBVA holds an indirect stake of 5.21% of share capital.\n\nIn relation to the list of the significant shareholders of the Company, we must report that, in January 2023, the company was notified of the dissolution and liquidation of the company Elguero, S.A., which as of 31 December 2022 directly held a significant stake of 3.33% of share capital. After the aforementioned dissolution and liquidation, the 5,819,474 shares in Tubos Reunidos S.A. held by Elguero S.A. were distributed equally among the four partners of the company, the Ybarra Aznar siblings, with each receiving 25%.\n\n## **Structure of the management body**\n\nAs communicated to the market via Inside Information Communication dated 14 July 2023, the Board of Directors of Tubos Reunidos S.A. acknowledged on that date the notification sent on 13 July 2023 by Mr Francisco Irazusta Rodriguez, in which he communicated his voluntary resignation as Executive Chairman of the Company and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective from 31 August 2023, to take on a new professional challenge at an international company outside Spain.\n\nIn accordance with the Tubos Reunidos S.A. Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, from 31 August 2023 when Mr Irazusta effectively resigned from his duties, Deputy Chair Emilio Ybarra Aznar temporarily took over duties as chair until a new non-executive chair of the Board of Directors was appointed, and Mr Carlos López de las Heras remained on the executive management team as Managing Director.\n\nOn 27 June 2023, the Board of Directors formally approved the separation of the posts of non-executive chairman and chief executive, in line with best good corporate governance practice and with the aim of strengthening the Board of Directors' independence.\n\nMr Josu Calvo Moreira was appointed independent director at the Company by co-optation on 21 December 2023, as well as non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors. The market\n\nwas notified of this by means of a communication of Other Relevant Information on 21 December. Tubos Reunidos, S.A. therefore strengthened its Board of Directors and its corporate governance model with a non-executive chairman, in order to navigate the demanding challenges facing the Group in the coming years. Mr Josu Calvo Moreira does not have any executive powers at Tubos Reunidos and retains his current position as CEO of Gonvarri Industries.\n\nThe Board of Directors expressly thanked the Deputy Chairman Mr Emilio Ybarra Aznar for his huge contribution to the Company when temporarily acting as Chairman.\n\nCurrently, the governing body of Tubos Reunidos, S.A. is its Board of Directors. In accordance with the provisions of the By-laws, the Board of Directors must be formed of a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 14 members. On 31 December 2023, the aforementioned Board was composed of 11 directors, distributed as follows:\n\n- 6 independent directors\n- 5 proprietary directors\n\nAt the date of issue of this document, the Board of Directors of Tubos Reunidos S.A. is made up of the following directors:\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# TUBOS REUNIDOS S.A.

All resolutions of the Board were made unanimously.\n\nIn 2023, the average remuneration for male directors was EUR 100,714 and for female directors EUR 68,125 (in 2022, it was EUR 153,561 for male directors and EUR 58,570 for female directors). The disparity in remuneration is because until 31 August 2023 compensation for the executive director was considerably higher than for other members.\n\nApplication of the Directors' Remuneration Policy, which is permanently published on the corporate website, aims to generate long-term value for shareholders and, in turn, ensure the long-term sustainability of the Company's results and activity. The compensation established in favour of the directors is based on the usual remuneration items for boards of listed Spanish companies.\n\nThe Annual Board Remuneration Report will be submitted as a separate item of the Agenda, to advisory vote of the General Meeting. This report is available to shareholders and investors on the Company's corporate website (www.tubosreunidosgroup.com) and on the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) portal (www.cnmv.es).\n\nAt a meeting held on 3 June 2009, the Board of Directors unanimously resolved to create a Delegated Committee. During 2023, the Delegated Committee did not hold any meetings. At the end of the 2023, the Delegated Committee was made up of the following Board members:\n\nProprietary Director Independent Director\n\n## DELEGATE COMMITTEE\n\n**Mr Josu Calvo Moreira** Chairman\n\n**Mr Jorge Gabiola Mendieta** Member\n\n**Mr Enrique Migoya Peláez** Member\n\n**Mr Cristóbal Valdés Guinea** Member\n\n**Mr Emilio Ybarra Aznar** Member\n\n**Ms Inés Núñez de la Parte** Secretary\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/39/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\" with a logo on the left.

The Meeting was broadcast live via the corporate web portal, while shareholders were given the opportunity to exercise their representation and voting rights via telematic means prior to the Meeting being held.\n\nDuring the Meeting, shareholders had the power to exercise their political rights in full, in accordance with the following aspects:\n\n- All shareholders have the right to attend the Meeting, regardless of the number of shares they hold.\n- Each share grants the right to one vote.\n- Under all circumstances, resolutions are adopted in accordance with the majorities established in the Capital Companies Act.\n\nThe attendance records for both those who attended the General Shareholders' Meetings in person and those who were represented for the last three financial years are shown below:\n\n**June 2021 — 47.38% October 2021 — 47.71%\\* December 2021 — 46.72%\\* June 2022 — 46.97% June 2023 — 41.20%**\n\n\\*Extraordinary meetings\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **System for good governance, risk management and regulatory compliance**\n\nAt Tubos Reunidos, we see commitment to good corporate governance as not only an obligation, but a fundamental pillar of our business strategy. Standing firm in its belief that transparent and responsible management is key to generating sustainable value, the Board of Directors has fostered a process for continuous improvement in this regard, positioning the company as a benchmark in the sector.\n\nOur firm commitment is reflected in our high levels of compliance with good governance recommendations, as endorsed by external evaluations. However, at Tubos Reunidos we do not settle for what we have already achieved. Aware of the importance of constant evolution, we have set as a strategic objective to adopt the best practices recommended by the *Unified code of good governance for listed companies* published in June 2020.\n\nThe Board of Directors continued to make progress in continuously improving corporate governance throughout 2023, with the aim of establishing a robust Corporate Governance System consistent with best practices. The main objective is to foster and maintain a corporate culture rooted in ethics and a commitment to sustainable development.\n\nIn this regard, on 21 December 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new regulation for the corporate body, specifically the Audit Committee Regulations. With a view to promoting sustainable and ethical business development, 2023 also saw the approval of new corporate policies such as:\n\n- The *Information security policy*, approved on 27 April, which forms part of the Company's Internal Control and Risk Management System.\n- The *Corporate procurement, service contracting and investments policy*, approved on 27 July.\n\nThe following strategic actions should also be highlighted:\n\n- Approval of the basic structure and general lines of the future *Sustainability Master Plan* for a 5-year period (2024–2028) on 21 December, establishing it as one of the foundations of the organisation's Strategic Plan.\n- Increased resources for the Sustainability Department.\n\nApproval of the updated Corporate Risk Map on 27 July, which reorganises risks and gives greater importance to cyber risks and sustainability, among others.\n\nThe Tubos Reunidos Group has continued to demonstrate its commitment to ethics, integrity and good governance throughout 2023, strengthening its Regulatory Compliance System.\n\nMatters related to ethics, integrity and good governance are centralised through our Regulatory Compliance System, which has a set of procedures designed to prevent, identify and correct unwanted behaviour.\n\nAfter consultation with employees' legal representatives, in 2023 the Board of Directors comprehensively reviewed and reformed the compliance system, so that it can be adapted by the deadline to the requirements of the new Act 2/2023 of 20 February on the Protection of Persons who Report Regulatory Violations and the Fight Against Corruption.\n\nIn 2023 we implemented and circulated an internal information system designed, established and managed in a secure way, which:\n\n- a) Ensures the confidentiality of whistleblowers' and third parties' identity mentioned in the communication, as well as the actions undertaken, ensures data protection, preventing access by unauthorised employees.\n- b) Allows communication to be submitted in writing or verbally, or both.\n- c) Integrates the various internal information channels.\n- d) Establishes guarantees to protect whistleblowers.\n- e) Has an established procedure for handling information received.\n\nTherefore, on 25 July 2023, the Board of Directors obtained a certificate of adequacy for the compliance system and its correct adaptation to the new legislation.\n\nThe comprehensive reform of the compliance system was communicated transparently to shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 29 June 2023, as item 9 under 'Matters for information'. In particular, shareholders were\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo with the letters 'TR' inside a green globe, followed by the text '2023 ANNUAL REPORT' and 'CONTENTS >>'.\n\ninformed of the reporting channels available to them for communicating any actions or omissions within the Tubos Reunidos Group of which they are aware and may constitute serious or very serious criminal or administrative violations, including those involving financial losses for the Public Treasury and/or Social Security.\n\nReform of the Compliance System required the following specific actions by the Board in 2023:\n\n- 1) Appointment on 30 March of the Secretary of the Board of Directors as System Manager for the Whistleblowing System (which forms part of the compliance system).\n- 2) Approval of the new Code of Ethical Conduct for the Tubos Reunidos Group on 25 May, with a new revised text adapted to new Act 2/2023, replacing and overriding the previous one approved in April 2021.\n- 3) Approval on 25 May of the *Corporate Policy on the Whistleblowing System and the Protection of the Whistleblower,* which sets out the general principles relating to the Internal Reporting System and has been duly published within the organisation.\n- 4) Approval on 25 May of the *Regulation on the Whistleblowing Channel*, which include the *Privacy policy* and the *Protocol prohibiting retaliation* as appendices. The Regulation and its appendices constitute the new information management procedure, replacing the *Whistleblowing channel regulations* approved in April 2021.\n- 5) Approval on 25 May of the new IMB Regulations, replacing those adopted on 29 April 2021.\n- 6) Approval 25 May of the new *Gifts and invitations policy*, which replaces the one approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 7) Approval on 29 June of a new *Corporate criminal risk prevention and compliance policy* adapted to Law 2/2023, replacing the policy approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 8) Approval on 29 June of a new *Criminal risk prevention manual* (general section) adapted to Law 2/2023, replacing the manual approved on 29 April 2021.\n- 9) Three additional documents remained at Audit Committee level and were overseen with a favourable opinion in July:\n- *Criminal risks prevention manual* (Specific Section).\n- *Ethical commitment of directors, executives and employees*.\n- Review of the adaptation of the new ethical commitment models.\n- 10) Approval on 21 December of the *Code of ethical conduct for suppliers of the Tubos Reunidos Group*.\n\nLikewise, the Board of Directors supervised the *Protocol for prevention and action against harassment* adapted to new Act 2/2023 on 21 December, with regard to duties in the field of compliance and approval of its implementation in 2024 at all Group companies. It is testament to the Group's commitment to zero tolerance of harassment. Anti-corruption measures have also been implemented, including specific training for HR personnel and the prohibition of practices such as bribery and money laundering. The Group reaffirms its commitment to the defence of Human Rights, both in its own operations and throughout its supply chain.\n\nThe new Whistleblowing Channel, which was updated in 2023, provides a safe and confidential way to report ethical or legal violations, demonstrating the Group's firm commitment to transparency and integrity. Although no reports have been received regarding sensitive matters such as corruption or human rights violations, the channel's existence reinforces the culture of compliance and responsibility within the organisation.\n\nIn fact, through its Regulatory Compliance System and its Code of Ethical Conduct, the Tubos Reunidos Group reaffirms its commitment to responsible behaviour, legality, respect for human rights and integrity in all its operations.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have a comprehensive Risk Management System applicable to all Group companies, as set out in the Corporate Risk Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2021.\n\nIn accordance with current regulations, Tubos Reunidos has detailed the risk management system implemented by the Company in the Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) for the 2023 financial year. This report specifies which bodies are responsible for formulating and implementing this system, as well as the main risks that could affect the achievement of business objectives and the level of tolerance established in this regard.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the management team manage the risks in order to reasonably guarantee that the entity achieves its objectives. This approach aims to provide an adequate level of security for various different stakeholders, including the market in general, in order to reasonably safeguard the value generated. The Risk Management System is constantly evolving and improving under the Group's responsibility.\n\nThe risk matrix of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) enables the company to identity the substantial elements of the financial statements, the statements or objectives of the financial information that is susceptible to risks, as well as to prioritise the operational processes that affect the financial information. This structure is to be reviewed annually in accordance with the plans established by the Group. During the 2023 financial year, the Group's ICFR was updated in response to organisational changes (included in the Steering Committee) and structural adjustments (business mergers between Group companies).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Royal Decree Law 18/2017, of 24 November, which transposes Directive 2014/95/EU into Spanish law, and the Law on Non-Financial Information and Diversity of 28 December 2018, in 2023 Tubos Reunidos prepared and published its Non-Financial Reporting Statement. This document contains the necessary information to understand the Group's performance, results and situation, as well as the impact of its activities in relation to environmental aspects, social aspects, human rights, the fight against corruption and bribery, as well as aspects relating to staff. This report has been verified by an independent verification service provider (E&Y), who issued a favourable opinion.\n\nThe actions carried out in the key areas, together with important reforms carried out in previous years (such as System reformulation in 2022 around ESG criteria), make the Tubos Reunidos Group's Corporate Governance System robust and effective. It provides a solid structure for conducting business, complying with the highest standards and best practices both nationally and internationally.\n\nThroughout 2024, the Tubos Reunidos Group will continue its commitment to continuously improve its corporate governance system.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Share price status and evolution**\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT CONTENTS\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Relevant data**\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Tubos Reunidos' share capital stood at EUR 3,493,617.76, represented by 174,680,888 shares, each with a nominal value of EUR 0.02.\n\nThese shares are listed on the stock exchanges in Bilbao and Madrid.
