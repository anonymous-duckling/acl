    "taxonomy_section": "{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 shows a clear commitment to respect for human rights. To realise this involvement, it has internal policies and procedures that are applied in all activities and at all levels. This commitment is the basis for all the relationships that Renta 4's entities establish with their stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, public administration and official bodies and society as a whole).\n\n## **1. Internal procedures and processes**\n\nThis approach is implemented through:\n\n- **1.** internal procedures and processes;\n- **2.** monitoring mechanisms;\n- **3.** internal and external channels to strengthen risk identification.\n\nBelow is a summary of the main indicators reflecting this fundamental principle and the most important milestones that have been achieved during 2023.\n\n#### **1.1. Code of Conduct**\n\nThere is a Code of Conduct, a top-level internal standard approved by the Board of Directors, consistent with international treaties, conventions and agreements (such as the United Nations Global Compact, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation).\n\n# <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>Human rights\n\nThis standard establishes general guidelines for action, in addition to the mission and values of Renta 4. These include:\n\n· Ethical behaviour.\n\n· Equality and non-discrimination, with the consequent prohibition of all types of harassment, intimidation, offensive or improper behaviour (including sexual proposals or suggestions) and other actions that may affect a person's dignity.\n\n· Work-life balance.\n\n· Information security.\n\n· Confidentiality.\n\n· Respect for the right to privacy and personal data protection.\n\n· Respect for intellectual property.\n\n· Occupational risk prevention.\n\n· Responsibility, which must also be reflected in accountability and the preservation of fair competition behaviours.\n\n· Due diligence in the use of resources.\n\n· Best practices in public tenders.\n\nLikewise, the Code of Conduct describes the general guidelines to be taken into account in its relationships with stakeholders:\n\n· Responsibility towards customers: Renta 4's relationship with its customers is based on transparency of information and acting in their best interests. These guidelines of conduct include investor protection, safeguarding assets and funds, financial responsibility and personal data protection.\n\n· Responsibility towards employees: for Renta 4, the relationship with employees is fundamental to safeguard fundamental rights. Firstly, because corporate culture is reflected in its work and the way it interacts with stakeholders, that is, by\n\nprotecting the rights of third parties. Secondly, because one of the Renta 4's maxims is to promote a work environment that fosters personal development.\n\n· Responsibility with suppliers: in the processes of approval, selection and contracting of suppliers for the acquisition of goods and services, Renta 4 will ensure competition, avoiding any type of interference that could compromise both the impartiality and transparency of the supplier selection process, in accordance with the Outsourcing Policy. It also ensures that third parties comply with principles and values similar to those applied by Renta 4 in its activities, assessing nonfinancial risks in its approvals.\n\n· Responsibility towards Public Administration and Official Bodies: Renta 4 Group is committed to collaborate and act with diligence in its relations with the competent authorities, to fiscal transparency and the prohibition of corruption and bribery. This matter is addressed in the 'Corruption and Bribery' section of this document.\n\n## **1.2. Rules of conduct for investor protection**\n\nCurrent securities market regulations require investment firms to provide their services honestly, fairly and professionally, in the best interests of their customers. Furthermore, banking regulation is committed to the defence of the banking customer in two directions:\n\n**1.** Through solvency requirements for credit institutions, aimed at market stability\n\n**2.** Promoting transparency in entity-customer relationships.\n\nThese premises, as reflected in the section on the Code of Conduct, form the basis of the daily work of all the people who make up Renta 4. Respecting and safeguarding standards of conduct not only achieves positive results with customers, but also creates value for society as a whole. One of Renta 4's values, set out in the Code of Conduct, is worth mentioning: Renta 4 aims to promote investment to improve people's lives. To this end, it is committed\n\nto moving towards a more sustainable and efficient world that contributes to the progress of society. In the financial system, the Renta 4 seeks to participate in innovation and the positive transformation of the economy. This vision is translated into a slogan that is communicated and disseminated internally to employees and externally to society: \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE AND SOCIETY\".\n\nFrom a practical point of view, this maxim has materialised in this financial year in the following way:\n\n· Through the analysis of regulatory obligations for investor protection and the internal development of projects to improve policies, procedures and processes.\n\n· Through the incorporation of good practices in the sector.\n\n· With the implementation of the supervisor's and auditors' recommendations and suggestions for improvement.\n\n· Working on the revision of the Customer Service mail service, which is seen as fundamental in improving the quality of services.\n\n· Implementing regulations and best practices related to sustainable finance in the area of investor protection, such as:\n\n- Adapting the suitability assessment (a questionnaire prior to the provision of portfolio management and investment advisory services aimed at understanding investment objectives, time horizon and financial situation) has been adapted to include a block where the customer can indicate their sustainability preferences.\n\n- Revising the information provided to customers prior to contracting products and services has been reviewed to incorporate sustainability features where appropriate.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Monitoring standardised information on the target market for sustainable products in order to modify processes and provide the right information to customers. These developments progress as instrument manufacturers provide data in a standardised way, to marketers.\n\n· Including the new requirements of the CNMV Guide on the assessment of suitability and good practices in the sector. The new processes have allowed for increased retail investor protection at various stages of the contracting process:\n\n- Determining whether or not a product is appropriate in accordance with the knowledge and experience of the customer;\n\n- Improving transparency in customer information\n\n- Adjusting the distribution procedures for certain products.\n\n#### **1.3. Personal data protection and information security**\n\nThe protection of personal data is a fundamental right recognised in Articles 18(4) of the Constitution, 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union.\n\nThe work carried out by Renta 4 to protect the personal data of data subjects is based on the principles of proactive responsibility, continuous improvement and privacy through design and by default.\n\nRenta 4, at the national level, has an Information Security Policy and Personal Data Protection, as well as different rules and procedures based on good practices and regulations whose objective is to safeguard the information assets of Renta 4, as well as to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, security and security of information. traceability and availability of sensitive information of Renta 4 and its customers. In addition, on an annual basis or when a significant change or event occurs, the safety regulatory body is reviewed and relevant employees and third parties are reached out for adherence.\n\nOn the other hand, the top management of Renta 4 is highly committed to the security of the entity's information. That is why the Information Security Committee meets on a quarterly basis, which deals with, among others, the following topics: Changes in the environment, security incidents and security and privacy initiatives. In addition, at least once a year, the Security Committee sets the annual information security and privacy strategy and targets. And at least twice a year, the Board of Directors meets to regularly monitor cybersecurity, including this issue on the agenda of its meetings. The Group's security manager is responsible for preparing and presenting the main information security issues of Renta 4 through the preparation of periodic reports.\n\nRenta 4 has standards applicable to all entities (national and foreign) that allow compliance with local regulations and the principles defined in internal regulations.\n\nRegarding data protection, Renta 4 attempts to support transparency and to comply in a timely manner with the management of the rights of access, rectification, opposition, erasure (\"the right to be forgotten\"), restriction of processing, portability and not to be subject to automated decisions. The applications received in 2023 have been handled satisfactorily.\n\n#### **The Importance of Cybersecurity**\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most relevant concerns of the Renta 4 Group due to the fact that there is constant interconnection through telecommunications, which results in more vulnerabilities within information systems. To mitigate this risk, it is constantly working to raise awareness and train each and every one of its employees and customers. There is an annual training and awareness plan for employees, which is reviewed annually. In addition, training and awareness content has been created published on the web so that all customers in order to prevent them from being victims of possible fraud and / or scams. On the other hand, cybersecurity tips and best practices are regularly sent to customers through commercial channels.\n\nRenta 4 Group is committed to the fight against cybercrime by ensuring proper information security management and continuous improvement of cybersecurity.\n\nOn an annual basis, Renta 4 reviews the Information Security and Personal Data Protection Policy, which is sent to all employees, along with security and privacy guidelines adjusted to the work position. In addition, all the standards and procedures that make up the Group's document system are reviewed and updated.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year Renta 4 carried out the following actions, inter alia:\n\n· Quarterly meetings of the Information Security Committee.\n\n· Collaborating in a coordinated manner with the privacy, risk and continuity departments to ensure adequate information security.\n\n· Maintaining the entity's entire document system up to date, tailoring all its content to market security standards.\n\n· Assessing, improving and maintaining the security of the data processing centre facilities.\n\n· To implement all standards and procedures developed in the area of Information Security.\n\n· Conducting ongoing information security assessments, identifying points of improvement, implementing action plans to improve the maturity of Renta 4 cybersecurity and constantly tracking cyber threats affecting the entity's assets.\n\n· Being in constant coordination with all the countries where Renta 4 carries out its activity in order to achieve the correct level of Information Security.\n\n· Performing tests of the Renta 4 technological contingency plan that includes events with cybersecurity components\n\nThe entity is committed to working with cybersecurity in order to achieve optimum and adequate levels of protection in its systems. To this end, it strives to constantly advance and improve its level of security.\n\n# **1.4. Prevention of market abuse**\n\nRegulation indicates that market abuse damages the integrity of financial markets and public confidence and impedes transparency, which is essential for trading.\n\nThe way in which the work this year has contributed to the fight against market abuse were as follows:\n\n· Have an Internal Rules of Conduct. These internal rules, which are no longer mandatory, are maintained and enhanced to disseminate to employees the internal procedures for (i) avoiding and managing conflicts of interest; (ii) personal transactions; or (iii) reporting indications of market manipulation and insider trading.\n\n· Drawing up Renta 4's asset inventory with the participation of all areas of Renta 4.\n\n· Classifying Renta 4's assets using the five dimensions (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, availability and auditability) and MAGERIT.\n\n· Making improvements to the remote-work process.\n\n· Preparing the annual training and awareness plan based on information security for Renta 4.\n\n· Improving standards and procedures for event management and reporting.\n\nIt should be stated that within all these points of improvement Renta 4 works daily to maintain the security of its systems, also having security systems such as: protection mechanisms against Denial of Service attacks, with different levels of Firewall that protect the Group's network, anti-malware systems, etc. In addition to the above, it has the necessary information to prevent, protect and respond to security and operational events.\n\nOn the other hand, Renta 4 has implemented a labelling system through Microsoft's AIP solution that allows encrypting information according to the Renta 4 taxonomy preventing unauthorised use and leakage of sensitive information from the entity.\n\nFinally, Renta 4 is implementing an event correlation solution that allows to improve the monitoring and detection of events that may affect Renta 4 cybersecurity. For these reasons, each year sets a series of objectives that are aligned with the needs of the Group. The next defined goals are:\n\n· To continue to train and raise awareness of Information Security amongst all employees.\n\n· To implement asset tagging throughout the Group using an automated tool.\n\n· Initiating certification of the ISO 27001:2022 best practice standard.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Work has been done on improving the systems and processes for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the supervisor.\n\n· Corporate Governance: information on corporate governance issues is mainly reflected in two documents:\n\n- The Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration.\n\n- The Annual Corporate Governance Report. Both documents are publicly available on the CNMV's website.\n\n· All employees in the commercial network have been trained to raise awareness of the need to detect suspicious transactions and to communicate them to appropriate departments for analysis.\n\n· Link: https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/ee/informaciongobcorp.aspx?TipoInforme=1&nif=A82473018\n\n· Identification of sensitive and prohibited activities and controls of the Renta 4 Group to prevent the risks of incurring in the offences regulated in articles 284 285, 285 bis, 285 ter and 285 quater of the Criminal Code.\n\n#### **1.5. Prevention of criminal risks**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group has an effective model of organisation and management of criminal risks.\n\nThe model consists of the following elements:\n\n- · Code of Conduct,\n- · Procedure for dealing with breaches of the model,\n- · Regulatory procedure for the internal information system,\n- · Disciplinary system,\n- · Regulations of the Compliance Unit\n- · Map of criminal risks with associated controls.\n\nAlso included in the model are the other agreements, policies, codes and protocols approved by Renta 4 on the prevention of criminal offences and regulatory compliance, including internal rules of supervision and control derived from or relating to the Internal Rules of Conduct or any of the other procedures. All this without prejudice to the internal rules specifically approved by the subsidiaries of Renta 4 for the correct implementation of the model in its scope of action.\n\nThe model described is applicable to the companies that make up the Renta 4 Group in Spain.\n\nWithin the model, sensitive and prohibited activities in which Renta 4 entities may be involved have been identified and that could lead to crimes against moral integrity, sexual harassment or hatred and praise:\n\n· Interpersonal relations between professionals of the same or different rank in the exercise of social activity of Renta 4.\n\n· Interpersonal relations of the members of the Renta 4 Group with third parties in the exercise of the social activity of Renta 4.\n\n· Public communications or through social networks and media by income staff 4.\n\nIn order to avoid these risks, general and specific mitigating controls are in place. The general controls are as follows: (i) Code of Conduct; (ii) 4 Income Structure; (iii) Complaints Channel; (iv) Regulatory Procedure of the Internal Information System; (v) Protocol of Action for Non-compliance with the Model; (vi) Disciplinary System; (vii) Regulations of the Compliance Unit; (viii) Audits; (ix) Training and Awareness; (x) Procedures for the selection and approval of suppliers.\n\nFor its part, the specific controls created to mitigate the risks exposed are: Policies on equality and non-discrimination; policies on the prevention of harassment at work; communication channel especially aimed at better treatment of harassment; in the selection of staff, the suitability of the candidate for the job required is determined as a determining factor, which is assessed solely on the basis of his or her previous experience and training; in internal promotion, an annual performance evaluation system is established based on objective criteria of merit and capacity.\n\n## **1.6. Third party risk prevention**\n\nThe entity has a series of risk prevention policies and, specifically, when outsourcing a service, it has drawn up the Outsourcing policy: this document defines the guidelines that must be taken into account in the decision-making, formalisation, management and control process when outsourcing to a third party the provision of the Renta 4 Group's own functions, both in normal and crisis situations.\n\nRenta 4 Group entities go through the following phases in every outsourcing process: (I) Opportunity assessment; (II) Detailed analysis and approval; (III) Tendering and awarding; (V) Implementation; (V): Monitoring; (VI) Reporting; and (VII) Exit or Renewal.\n\nmanagement, good practices on the different types of existing attacks, proper management of corporate social networks, social engineering, fraud and the use of corporate devices.\n\nIn terms of targets for 2024 the following is highlighted:\n\n· A training and awareness plan on information security has been approved by the Security Committee in October 2023. Although it has already started, the goal is to launch it throughout 2024\n\n· Personal data protection training for all employees.\n\n#### **2. Presence in the media**\n\nThroughout 2023, Renta 4 has been present 12,315 times in publications in the written press, web and print media, radio and television. It maintains a good presence both in volume and in the quality of the appearances.\n\nIn this way, Renta 4 is committed to fostering dialogue with its stakeholders and consolidating its position on the platforms as a stronghold of information and training.\n\nAs in previous years, the Group's reputation has been measured in order to detect potential sources of reputational risk, level of trust among users, identify more common topics and increase brand recognition and positioning. In this regard, it is worth mentioning:\n\n· 2023 has been a positive year in terms of reputation and presence in media with specialised content in the sector and general media in which it has an increasing presence. Renta 4 continues to advance to become a reference for economic and market information, but, in addition, increases corporate information where it is not only a source of information, but \"Renta 4\" is the protagonist.\n\nThe factors that Renta 4 considers when carrying out due diligence on a potential service provider relate to: the nature of the provider and its capabilities, its ethical principles, the processing of personal data that it may carry out and the security and internal control measures that it has in place.\n\nIn accordance with the above, among other aspects, the company evaluates whether the supplier: (i) complies with Renta 4's values and Code of Conduct; (ii) acts ethically and with social responsibility; (iii) respects international standards on human rights, environmental protection and appropriate working conditions, including the prohibition of child labour; (iv) has a reputation and culture compatible with Renta 4's standards; (v) has a liability prevention model and (vi) has high ethical, behavioural and Social Responsibility principles in accordance with its profession, sector and jurisdiction.\n\n#### **1.7. Awareness raising and training**\n\nDuring 2022, training and awareness-raising procedures on privacy and personal data protection were approved so that all Renta 4 employees internalise key aspects on this matter and integrate them into their daily work. Training employees as important as, for example, the procedure for an early resolution of events related to data security.\n\nTo this end, throughout 2023 the corporate intranet has continued to be updated and enriched with training security content through policies, standards, procedures and training videos.\n\nThe regular sending of newsletters, as awarenessraising pills, has also been maintained during the 2023 financial years, on aspects related to:\n\n· Personal data protection;\n\n· Procedures included in the ICN;\n\n· Information security.\n\nOn the latter subject, the most important ones are related to safe Internet browsing, asset\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Negative news appearances in the media have been very few and all of them with a \"mild\" rating in relation to reputational risk. The impacts of this news (21) classified as \"mild negative\" represent 0.016% of the total impacts of 2023. The rest is classified as neutral, positive or very positive.\n\n· Again, in 2023 it is observed that the positive reputation of Renta 4 Banco continues to rise. It should be noted that the environment is becoming more complicated every year given the increase in controversial headlines in all media (clickbait, fake news...) and in a sector (banking/financial) punished by continuous reputation crises for more than a decade.\n\n· In addition, 2023 has been a year in which, through the campaign of the Easy account, Renta 4 has doubled the annual investment in presence, through campaigns and paid content, to give greater visibility to the product and the brand. A product that democratises investment by being oriented toward the retail segment.\n\n· Continuing with the previous point, throughout 2023, Renta 4 has installed the first giant canvas. This, covers the entire building, under construction, of Paseo de la Habana 63 since May 2023, with a message that indicates the following \"A bank where any investor is a great customer\". This same message has been used to cover the façades of the offices that have been under construction for remodelling of façade and interiors.\n\n· Finally, the \"Investment for All\" campaign, which is developed with a 100% target aimed at raising awareness of society about the accessibility of investment for anyone. This communication action is one of the actions that are developed within the framework of the SDG to reduce inequality, acquired by the entity in this sense. A campaign that has impacted more than 300,000 unique users through social channels, with different versions of videos that demystify investment and direct them to a website (invertir-para-todos.com) with content.\n\n#### **3. Monitoring**\n\n Human rights monitoring seeks to gather information on the human rights situation in a country or region using available methods, with the aim of participating in advocacy activities against human rights violations.\n\nTo do this, various indicators are applied such as participation, self-identification, data breakdown, privacy, transparency and accountability.\n\nIn the scope of the action of Renta 4, work is carried out to monitor the application of the various rules of conduct and protection of the rights of people applying as principle the primary use of due diligence that is necessary to integrate improvements in it process.\n\nThis monitoring work allows: (i) identify risks to prevent and mitigate them promptly; (ii) assess the effectiveness of controls; and (iii) identify processes and procedures to be updated.\n\nThe main work carried out in 2023, separated by the indicators described in the previous section, is described below:\n\n· Code of Conduct: In 2023, the Code of Conduct was extended to foreign affiliates: (i) all of them have formally adhered to through the approval of the document by their respective boards of directors, and (ii) have established internal procedures to strengthen communication to employees and obtain their signature.\n\n· Standards of Conduct: Among the works carried out during 2023, the update of the policies of regulatory compliance, classification of customers, product governance, incentives, commercial communications, minimum records and recordings.\n\n· Protection of personal data: During the year 2023 we have worked on the following objectives:\n\n- Development of the tasks necessary to implement the recommendations and suggestions for improvement resulting from the voluntary data protection audit completed in December 2022.\n\n- Advance in the review of risk analysis of data processing for which Renta 4 entities are responsible. In addition, a procedure has been approved for the review of data protection measures that aims to define the elements that trigger the review and updating of measures on the concept and design of the treatment, governance and policies, data protection by default and from the design, prevention and management of personal data breaches and security.\n\n- Continuous monitoring of privacy area policies and procedures. It highlights the joint work between the parent company and foreign subsidiaries to bet on principles of personal data protection at the level of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n- Training and awareness: From the area of privacy, the application of the principles of data protection is promoted by all employees of Renta 4. For this, all procedures are made available to workers, after explanation. In addition, work has been done on a new training for all employees, which will be launched in 2024.\n\n· Information security: The main projects and works that have been carried out in 2023 have been described in section 5.1.3 Protection of personal data and information security, in the section The relevance of cybersecurity.\n\n· Prevention of market abuse: In addition to the projects already described, a new revision of the Internal Rules of Conduct was carried out in 2023.\n\n· Prevention of criminal risks: A comprehensive review of the organisation and control model for the prevention of criminal risks was carried out in 2023. Work has been done to update the inherent and residual risks of the Spanish entities integrated in the model, as well as the map that collects the controls that are available. As part of this project, all the procedures that make up the model have been strengthened: (i) Complaints channel procedure (with the news contained in Law 2/2023, of 20 February, regulating the protection of persons who report regulatory violations and the fight against corruption); (ii) protocol for action against breaches; (iii) Regulations of the Compliance Unit and (iv) the disciplinary system.\n\n· In addition, a project has been initiated to update the model of prevention of criminal risks of foreign affiliates that complies with local regulations and income standards 4.\n\n· Training and awareness-raising: During 2023, the following training and reminders were carried out to mitigate the risks described. In particular, it highlights:\n\n- The formation of market abuse to the commercial network\n\n- Training and awareness-raising in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing for all employees\n\n- Information security training and awareness for all employees\n\n- Awareness of outsourcing risks\n\n- Awareness-raising on personal data protection\n\n- Awareness of standards of conduct in the stock market\n\n- Awareness of the complaints channel\n\nImage /page/168/Picture/26 description: The image shows the number 169 in white text on a green background.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-169-0\"></span>Derived from the Monitoring Work, the Following Data Are Confirmed:\n\n| Material fines, penalties and compensation for damages resulting from violations of social and human rights factors                                                                                                           | 0 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labour force itself                                                                                                                                      | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labour force itself that are cases of non-compliance with the<br>United Nations Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises | 0 |\n| Amount of material fines, sanctions and compensation for serious human rights problems and incidents                                                                                                                          | 0 |\n| Number of incidents of discrimination                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labor force itself that are cases of non-compliance with the<br>United Nations Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises  | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights cases in which the company played a role in obtaining redress for those affected                                                                                                               | 0 |\n\n## **4. Internal and external channels**\n\nCommunication mechanisms are a key element in improving internal processes and procedures. Renta 4 has, among others, the following channels:\n\n· Customer Service: Responsible for handling all complaints and claims that customers may submit related to their legally recognised interests or rights.\n\n· Complaints channel: Renta 4 has a reporting channel available to both employees and interest groups (customers, suppliers, administration, volunteers, professionals in the framework of an employment or statutory relationship already completed, family or any other third party). This channel, which allows anonymous communication, is available electronically, by telephone, by post and in person.\n\n· Exercise of the rights associated with the protection of personal data: In compliance with the data protection regulations, Renta 4 offers to interested parties a channel for the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, opposition, portability, deletion, limitation to processing, withdrawal of consent and not to be subject to automated decisions.\n\n#### **Table of Relevant Data on the Information Received Through the Channels**\n\n| Complaints channel: Number of complaints received                                               | 0  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Number of rights associated with the protection of personal data                                | 50 |\n| Number of complaints filed through channels for people in their own workforce to raise concerns | 0  |\n| Number of complaints filed with OECD National Contact Points for Multinational Enterprises      | 0  |\n| Number of complaints filed with OECD National Contact Points for Multinational Enterprises      | 0  |\n\n# Corruption and bribery\n\nRenta 4's Code of Conduct, the highest level of internal rules, establishes the following among its five general principles of conduct:\n\n'No employee of the Entity shall offer, pay, request any payment, gift, promise or compensation with the purpose of obtaining favourable treatment in the commercial activity or in the decision-making process. Likewise, Group employees shall refrain from accepting gifts, hospitality or any type of compensation offered by other Group employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties, intermediaries or any third party with whom they have a relationship. For such purposes, payment, gift, promise or compensation shall be understood as anything given that exceeds the usual, social and courtesy practices, favours or services that imply privilege or unjustified advantage to natural persons or entities or that may condition the performance of functions. Renta 4 Group's employees shall not make donations on behalf of it or for its account, either directly or indirectly, to political parties or contribute in any way to their financing'.\n\nBeing considered one of the five most important for Renta 4, this behavioural guideline is intended to reflect that the entity's mission and objectives shall only be considered achieved within a framework of transparency and zero tolerance for corrupt practices.\n\nLikewise, the following are included as general principles of conduct for all employees: (i) faithful accounting of transactions and their adequate reflection in the financial information published by Renta 4 and (ii) refraining from any action that compromises the entity's reputation, by carrying out unlawful practices when participating in public tenders.\n\nRegarding the guidelines for dealing with the competent authorities and official bodies, the Renta 4 Group has established the following basic principles:\n\n· For the exchange of information, the following premises, shall be taken into account, among others: (i) communications shall observe institutional respect and be developed under criteria of maximum collaboration and compliance with the Law; (ii) requests shall be processed with diligence; (iii) the delivery, promise or offer of any kind of payment, fee, gift or compensation to any authorities, public officials or employees or managers of companies or public bodies in Spain or any other country, whether made directly to them or indirectly through persons or companies related to them and whether it is addressed to the public official or the employee themselves or to another person indicated by them, shall be forbidden.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Regarding tax obligations: (i) practices that imply illegally avoiding the payment of taxes to the detriment of the Treasury shall be avoided and (ii) professional activities in countries or territories classified as tax havens in accordance with the Spanish legislation, if ever developed, shall be identified and defined.\n\nIn this sense, Renta 4 has, among others, the following measures:\n\n· The Internal Rules of Conduct (already described in the section on Human Rights). Revised and updated throughout 2023, this internal standard is intended to serve as a guide for managing conflicts of interest, as well as establishing guidelines for employee behaviour in the securities market.\n\n· The model of organisation and control for the prevention of criminal risks: During 2023, with regard to corruption and bribery, the following crimes were updated:\n\n- Business corruption, defined in article 286 bis of the Criminal Code: The following have been identified as sensitive and prohibited activities: (i) Contracting and commercial relations with customers, suppliers and other individuals; (ii) Accept or offer an unjustified benefit or advantage on behalf of Renta 4 entities as consideration to unduly favour another.\n\n- The associated controls, in addition to those of a general nature, are: The Incentive Policy, updated in 2023 and the Remuneration Policy for Directors.\n\n- The offence of bribery under article 424 of the Criminal Code: Sensitive and prohibited activities have been identified: (i) Relations in general with the Public Administration; (ii) Relations in general with foreign administrations; (ii) Management of administrative inspections (regulatory, tax, social security, working conditions, etc.); (iii) Management of gifts and donations to public authorities or officials; (iv) Management of public funds on deposit or (v) deposit of securities or other assets seized by public authority.\n\n- To mitigate risks, the following specific mitigating controls are available: Policy on the prohibition of offering/accepting gifts expressly provided for in the Code of Conduct; procedure for justifying corporate expenses; disposition limits and authorisation levels for expenses incurred from Renta 4 Group funds: Publication of financial information; Audit of accounts.\n\n- Offences against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism regulated by article 301 of the Criminal Code. As sensitive or prohibited activities have been identified all those marked as such in the current regulations. Specific controls mitigating the risk of committing these crimes are: (i) the Internal Manual on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing; (ii) the internal structure for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, articulated in three levels; (iii) the Committee on the Prevention of Money Laundering; (iv) the Operational Unit for the Prevention of Money Laundering (UOPBC); (v) the Representative to SEPBLAC; (vi) the Customer Knowledge and Admission Policy; (vii) the Risk Stratification Policy; (viii) the procedure for controlling the actions of agents; (ix) the procedure for controlling movements of cash means of payment; (x) the reporting procedure; (xi) the checklist verification process; (xii) the money laundering and terrorist financing risk self-assessment report; (xiii) the annual internal audit; (xiv) the annual report of the UOPBC; (xiv) annual review by external expert and (xv) the control procedure of subsidiaries in third countries.\n\n· Outsourcing policy: although this internal regulation has already been described in the section on Human Rights, it is mentioned in this section in order to indicate that, in the process of approving third parties, aspects such as the following are taken into account: (i) whether the supplier has a criminal risk prevention model; (ii) whether it has a Corporate Responsibility Policy or (iii) whether its principles and values are in line with Renta 4's Code of Conduct.\n\n## **1. Training and information**\n\nRenta 4 has adopted the necessary measures to ensure that employees are aware of the internal policies, procedures and controls established in the Anti-Money Laundering & Countering Financing of Terrorism Manual.\n\nConsequently, Renta 4's employees must know and put into practice the prevention measures contemplated by internal regulations and examine those transactions which, due to their nature or the circumstances and characteristics of the clients, present indications of possible links with money laundering or terrorist financing activities, in order to adopt the additional prevention and communication measures defined from time to time. To this end, the Manual is always accessible and updated on the intranet.\n\nWith this objective, training has also been implemented, in which knowledge of financial sanctions has been reinforced, with a view to understanding the obligations to which the Group is subject. In 2023, this training has been directed as a priority to all employees of the Management of Collective Investment Institutions (CII) and Plans, as well as to foreign subsidiaries. In addition, it has been extended to new employees from all areas who joined after the last training session. This comprehensive approach reflects the organisation's commitment to continuously updating its teams, ensuring that all employees, both existing and new arrivals, are properly trained in best practices to know financial sanctions obligations. This initiative not only strengthens internal security, but also strengthens the company's position in promoting ethical and legal conduct at all levels of operation.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the training of Prevention and Detection of Corruption or Bribery, to indicate that the training provided in the field of money laundering prevention provided content related to the detection of crimes related to corruption and bribery, under the lens of the prevention of laundering. The training session was launched at the end of December and has remained active until the end of January 2024, as of 31/12/2024, 46% of the employees convened had been trained.\n\n#### **Main Indicators of this Activity in 2023**\n\n| Number of pending court proceedings due to arrears                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Number of confirmed incidents related to contracts with business partners that were terminated or not renewed due to corruption or bribery-related violations |\n| Number of convictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws                                                                                  |\n\n| Number of pending court proceedings due to arrears                                                                                                               | 0 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|\n| Number of confirmed incidents related to contracts with business partners that were terminated or not<br>renewed due to corruption or bribery-related violations | 0 |\n| Number of convictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws                                                                                     | 0 |\n\n#### **2. Measures to prevent money laundering**\n\nThe risk of financial crime originates from the actions or the use of means, products and services of Renta 4 in activities of a criminal or illegal nature. These activities include, inter alia, money laundering, terrorist financing, violation of international sanctions programmes, corruption, bribery and tax evasion. Given the universal and globalised nature of financial crimes, which take advantage of the international economy, their detection, deterrence and disruption require a coordinated response from both the international community and the financial sector.\n\nIn this context Renta 4 recognises the significance of this problem and the important role that financial institutions and other economic agents play in its prevention. Consequently, measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism are based on three fundamental pillars: The adoption of the highest international standards, their adequacy and compliance through global policies, and the implementation of technological systems that enable such compliance. Renta 4 constantly strives to improve its control framework and maintains an uncompromising stance on non-compliance with financial crime regulations, both internationally and in the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe Renta 4 commitment is reflected by the establishment of mandatory rules and procedures, to ensure strict compliance with current regulations in relation to the prevention of money laundering. In addition, Renta 4 commits to follow the recommendations and guidelines issued by international bodies such as the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Banking Authority (EBA), as well as relevant national and international authorities. These manuals comprehensively detail the internal control measures implemented by Renta 4, providing detailed information on policies related to due diligence, information management, document preservation, assessment and management of laundering risks, and the management of the risks of the company. communication and admission of customers and continuous monitoring of the business relationship.\n\nThese policies are kept updated and based on a prior risk analysis, a practical report adapted to the reality of the activity of Renta 4, which acts as an x-ray of the business from the perspective of anti-money laundering. Using this approach, Renta 4 identifies the potential risks of someone taking advantage of the activity carried out by the entity introduce, move or hide funds of suspicious origin. In order to mitigate these risks, group entities are classified, designing and implementing specific measures and controls. In addition, a specific risk analysis is performed and documented before the launch of a new product, the provision of a new service or a new distribution channel or the use of a new technology. This involves the implementation of appropriate measures to manage risk. Similarly, a risk analysis is carried out on the customer's own characteristics, classifying them into risk levels with the aim of designing and implementing measures and controls to mitigate risk.\n\nThe risk management model of money-laundering and terrorist financing prevention is under constant independent review. This evaluation is complemented by internal and external audits. In accordance with Spanish regulations, an external expert annually carries out a review of the money laundering and terrorist financing prevention programme implemented in Spain. For this reason, work has continued on the Action\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nPlan approved for the exercise in compliance with the recommendations issued by the external expert and the Supervisor in the field, as well as strengthening the process of updating the proceedings, no significant deficiencies were identified.\n\nThe organisational structure that Renta 4 has established for Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism includes:\n\n· An Internal Control Body, through the creation of the Committee for the Prevention of Money Laundering, a centralised body at the group level. This committee plays a crucial role in meeting monthly to address issues related to the prevention of money-laundering. One of its distinctive features is its composition, which includes representatives from all business areas, thus providing a deep understanding of the Renta 4 operating environment. This comprehensive approach ensures a unanimous commitment to the implementation of money laundering prevention regulations and ensures sustained effectiveness in the management of associated risks. The constant interaction and collaboration between the various departments, facilitated by the presence of their representatives on the committee, strengthens organisational cohesion and reinforces our commitment to the highest ethical and legal standards in all facets of our operations.\n\n· An Anti-Money Laundering Technical Unit, centralised at Group level, with specialised staff, exclusive dedication and appropriate training in analysis. The main objective of this unit is to define and supervise the processes within the business, as well as to ensure compliance with the policy for the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\n· A representative before the SEPBLAC in charge of administration and appointed in turn by the Board of Directors, who is ultimately responsible for compliance with the reporting obligations established in Law 10/2010, of 28 April.\n\nIn the exercise of its management function and in line with its commitment to the fight against moneylaundering and the financing of terrorism, the administrative body has designated one of its members as responsible for this matter. This designated, with sufficient knowledge and experience, stands as the main point of contact between the *Compliance Officer* and the management body. Distinguishing itself in this way by its firm commitment to the highest standards of regulatory compliance in the field of prevention. Proactively, it adapts quickly to the commitments made, demonstrating a continuous ability to quickly adjust to the new requirements set by the guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA). This flexibility and promptness in responding to emerging regulations not only reflect the entity's commitment to integrity and transparency, but also underscore its diligent approach to the constant evolution of regulatory frameworks. The agile adaptation to the EBA guidelines ensures that the entity not only meets current requirements, but also proactively anticipates future regulatory demands, thus strengthening its position as a committed and compliant actor in the financial field.\n\nThis organisational structure stands as an essential pillar to effectively manage the risk of regulatory noncompliance, which carries a relevant reputational risk. Said risk has the potential to have a significant negative impact on customer relationships, markets, employees and authorities. Specifically, non-compliance can trigger sanctions, cause damage or result in the cancellation of contracts, with detrimental consequences for the image projected by the entity.\n\nAs a financial group with subsidiaries in various jurisdictions, Renta 4 persists in implementing a uniform Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Compliance Model (PBC/FT) in all the countries in which it operates. This effort results in the reinforcement of *reporting obligations* to the matrix, with the aim of obtaining relevant information with greater regularity and detail. Special attention is paid to critical areas, such as the detection of suspicious transactions, high-risk customer discharges, coincidences with lists of persons with public responsibility (PRP). Also, during 2023, controls in these countries have been strengthened, especially in the area of sanctions filtering, homogenising policy and lists to consult. This model adapts to the local regulations of the jurisdictions in which Renta 4 is present, incorporating the best practices of the international financial industry and the recommendations of international organisations such as the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nIn the course of 2023, a new approach to the administration of the tools for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (PBC&FT) has also been launched, in order to enhance the efficiency of these processes and strengthen the analytical and research capabilities. As a result of these efforts, Renta 4 has resolved a significant number of investigation files, culminating in the submission of multiple suspicious transaction communications to the relevant authorities.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 has implemented an annual training plan on Prevention of Money Laundering (PBC) and Terrorist Financing (FT) for its employees, with the aim of raising awareness on this crucial matter. This training programme includes various actions, such as e-learning courses and videos, designed for both new entrants and established employees.\n\nWithin this plan, each training action is specifically adapted to the group to which it is directed. This ranges from general concepts derived from the regulation applicable in PBC/FT, both internal and external, to specific issues affecting the functions performed by each group. During 2023, a comprehensive training initiative on the Prevention of Money Laundering was carried out, divided into two sessions with specific contents and adapted to the different needs of the employees called.\n\nIn the first instance, a general training session was held for bank employees and subsidiaries abroad, addressing fundamental concepts and regulatory updates. Simultaneously, a second specific session was held for the Manager of Collective Investment Institutions (CII) and Plans. It highlights the achievement of completing 48% of general training and 36% of specific training for managers to date, evidencing a solid progress in the training of the employees called.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the training was launched at the end of December and has been active until the end of January 2024, underlining our continued commitment to updating and strengthening knowledge on the prevention of money laundering in all areas of the organisation.\n\nIn addition, interactive methodology, continuous evaluation, digital resources, interdepartmental collaboration and continuous feedback are key elements that enrich the training experience, promoting participation, self-directed learning and constant improvement in the implementation of prevention policies. In short, training goes beyond the mere transmission of information, seeking to create an interactive learning environment that adapts to the specific needs of the organisation, fosters collaboration and promotes a culture of continuous prevention.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 believes that both sustainability risk and reputational risk would be mitigated by establishing policies and procedures with a view to Corporate Social Responsibility, with a vocation for permanence and a commitment to the highest level of business management, as well as shared value with the citizens in its sphere of action. The objective pursued with the appropriate management of these risks is to generate profit in a responsible manner, considering sustainable investment as one of the main levers for the progress of the entities and of society.\n\nTo achieve this aim, Renta 4 works to raise awareness and implement incremental measures in this area, by issuing a series of annual policies and reports to inform its stakeholders about the measures to manage and reduce these non-financial risks. These include:\n\n· The establishment of an internal committee or ESG Committee was set up last year, which is responsible for supervising the reporting process and internal control systems in ESG matters, and for submitting the information in this respect to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n· The preparation of the Group's ESG policy, which establishes sustainability as a priority, integrating ESG aspects into its business strategy and corporate culture. On the other hand, publishing in turn ESG policy for Renta 4 Gestora, ESG policy of asset management\n\n· The preparation and disclosure of PIAs or principal adverse impacts both at the level of marketer (Renta 4 Banco) and manager (Renta 4 Gestora), which will be updated periodically according to the evolution of the regulations.\n\n· The publication of an information statement on non-financial risks, which is included in the annual report and which sets out the measures adopted and their annual improvement in accordance with the development of best practices and regulations.\n\n· Additionally, the Group adapts to the ESG Taxonomy Regulation in accordance with regulatory requirements and deadlines by establishing the 'ESG Taxonomy Exposure Eligibility Assessment Procedure' in which both internal and external tools (Clarity AI) are used to report compliance with the eligibility of exposures under the taxonomy in the Statement of Non-Financial Information.\n\n# <span id=\"page-172-0\"></span>Company\n\n· It should be noted that in 2022 Renta 4 Banco began the inclusion of the ESG Risk framework in its Risk Appetite Framework. Internally, policies and procedures are prepared ad reviewed that identify, regulate and mitigate these ESG risks, although they are not a priori material.\n\n· Alignment with international public objectives through the accession of Renta 4 as a group, since January 2023, to the Principles of Responsible Investment of the Unity Nations,\n\n· Finally, it should be noted that Renta 4 Banco joined the NZBA commitment in January 2023. A methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of the Renta 4 Group has been developed in accordance with the GHG Protocol and progress is being made toward the first target set for neutrality in operational GHG emissions by the end of 2025.\n\nThe group continues the process of implementing the different regulations and updating regulations for implementing and disclosing information related to sustainability in the financial services sector, starting in past years and with the help of external experts to evolve and adapt adequately the policies, procedures and measures for the analysis of the current situation of the group with respect to what is required on the integration of ESG risks.\n\n#### **1. Contributions to industry associations**\n\nRenta 4 establishes alliances with associations from different sectors in the communities where it operates, relying on them to identify and try to respond to the needs of the local environment. The total contribution of Renta 4 to non-for-profit sector associations in 2023 amounted to €139,068.20.\n\nThese include the partnership with UNPRI, in line with the entity's commitment to the implementation of responsible investment policies, and NZBA, which joins forces with the banking industry to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission neutrality.\n\nRenta 4 Gestora SGIIC SA and Renta 4 Pensiones SGFP SA are ordinary members of INVERCO, the\n\nAssociation of Collective Investment Institutions and Pension Funds, the Spanish umbrella organisation for collective investment schemes. Its members are Spanish entities that manage investment funds and pension plans, as well as foreign entities that are duly registered and controlled by the Spanish Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The instalments paid in 2023 were 15,000 euros and 25,000 euros respectively.\n\n#### **2. Information on partnership or sponsorship activities**\n\nIn the solidarity field, the Group's activities are mainly channelled through donations made to various associations. In particular, during the year 2023 Renta 4 has donated a total of €167,475 distributed as detailed in the following table:\n\n|  | Association                                   | Amount (€) |\n|--|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n|  | Renta 4 Foundation                            | 99,000     |\n|  | Donation Techo Foundation Constitution        | 2,308      |\n|  | Sports Club Cycle Tourist                     | 45         |\n|  | Royal Theatre Foundation                      | 64,377     |\n|  | Assoc. of entrepreneurs of the Costa Tropical | 25         |\n|  | Ampao Foundation                              | 600        |\n|  | Cofrad Penit of our Father Jesus Nazareth     | 325        |\n|  | Royal Economic Society Friends of the Country | 360        |\n|  | University of Valladolid                      | 125        |\n|  | Alfonso Sese Tena Foundation                  | 310        |\n|  | Total                                         | 167,475    |\n\nOne of the main solidarity actions is carried out through the activity of the Renta 4 Foundation. Today, Renta 4 Banco represents 100% of the contributions received by the Renta 4 Foundation to carry out its activities. In 2023, this contribution was €99,000,00.\n\nThe Renta 4 Foundation donates annually to projects that promote education in the most vulnerable populations of Spain, Africa, and Latin America in order to ensure that high quality education reaches the greatest number of young people following transparency values.\n\nThe Renta 4 Foundation involves the Group's employees in the project proposals and associations that can participate in the selection process. The foundation's board of trustees analyses every proposed project/association and checks whether they meet the established requirements. Then, some projects and associations are validated and all employees vote to choose the ones with the most votes.\n\nCurrently, the foundation makes annual contributions of €6,000 euros to 14 projects. These assignments are revalidated on an annual basis, although 7 of them already have a continuity commitment, given the path shared with the projects developed in them.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Table of Details of the Contributions Made by the Renta 4 Foundation to Solidarity Associations**\n\n| Item                                                       | Amount (€) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| By employee vote                                           |            |\n| Montemadrid Foundation                                     | 6,000      |\n| Love without Barriers Foundation                           | 6,000      |\n| Juan Dreamador Foundation                                  | 6,000      |\n| Foundation Love without Barriers                           | 6,000      |\n| Ramon Rey Ardid Foundation                                 | 6,000      |\n| Carpio Perez Association                                   | 6,000      |\n| Senara Foundation                                          | 6,000      |\n| By direct assignment of the Foundation's board of trustees |            |\n| Canary Martinez Foundation                                 | 5,000      |\n| Water of Coconut Foundation                                | 6,000      |\n| Prodis Foundation                                          | 6,000      |\n| Agh Foundation                                             | 6,700      |\n| Procivism Foundation                                       | 10,000     |\n| Sustainable Development Foundation ADF                     | 6,000      |\n| Granadown Foundation                                       | 6,000      |\n| Total                                                      | 87.700     |\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 participates directly in solidarity actions, ensuring that they are always within the area of action that the Group has set itself: education and culture as vehicles for the development of society and people, with a special focus on social inclusion and the development of the most disadvantaged groups. Among these actions there are examples such as sponsorship of the Teatro Real (€64,377) or sponsorship of a flat for the reintegration of mentally disabled persons from the Techo Foundation (€2,308).\n\n#### **3. Company commitment to sustainable development through training society**\n\nDue to Renta 4's activity as a bank specialised in capital markets, an activity of a global nature and with a wide technological scope, the impact on suppliers and employment is usually broad.\n\nIn addition to the effects described above, the activity of Renta 4 consists in democratising intermediation and asset management, which has a positive effect on the financial situation, providing a value-added service with impact on the citizens' finances and savings. The dissemination and pedagogical work is a commitment that is embraced across the entire organisation, both in the branches and at headquarters.\n\nThese training and information events take place both in a framework of proximity, from the conference rooms available to each of the offices of the network, and in a national framework as face-to-face and online events, from the auditorium that has the headquarters.\n\n#### **Conferences from the Office Network**\n\nIn 2023, 106 training and information courses on the different investment products were organised from the network of offices, 13.1% less than in 2022, but this concentration has better selected the topics and mobilised more registrations reaching 3,740, increasing these by 4.3% to the previous year. The average number of participants per course or seminar has increased from 29.4 to 35.3, an increase of 205.\n\n| Office courses                | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | %      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Total courses completed       | 102   | 122   | 106   | -13.1% |\n| Total enrolments              | 3,902 | 3,586 | 3,740 | 4.3%   |\n| Average enrolments per course | 38.3  | 29.4  | 35.3  | 20.0%  |\n\n#### **Conferences from the Headquarters**\n\nIn the form of webinar and face-to-face, from the auditorium of the headquarters, 41 training and information events have been held, which represents 10.6% more than in 2020. These events have reached 13,217 registered, 20.8% less than in the previous year. This fall in attendance has been offset by the very high growth in the visualisations of the \"on demand\" events that amounts to 100.55 accumulating a total of 57,640 views. That is, events in webinar format are consuming a lot in deferred. The user is getting used to choosing the time he prefers to play it.\n\n| Webinars                      | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | %      |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total courses completed       | 24     | 37     | 41     | 10.8%  |\n| Total enrolments              | 7,814  | 16,691 | 13,217 | -20.8% |\n| Average enrolments per course | 325.6  | 451.1  | 322.4  | -28.5% |\n| Total views on demand         | 29,153 | 28,755 | 57,640 | 100.5% |\n\nOne of the training conferences with the greatest participation was the \"Saver to Investor Cycle\" that proposes conferences that go through the fundamentals of investment, funds, fixed income or the importance of financial planning, as well as financial planning. that begins in early October coinciding with the Day of Financial Education, and that accumulates 6,440 visualisations. The event with most total views.\n\nAnother cycle with great educational value is the \"Invest in IT cycle\", an open cycle that invites users to obtain profitability in their personal development, with lectures on culture, education, life experiences. This cycle has accumulated 12,975 views in 2023, almost 25% of the total.\n\nIn addition to conferences, multiple pieces of content are produced and disseminated throughout the year around the theme of sustainability in the form of blog posts, video shorts, conferences, webinars and courses...\n\n# **4. Description of the relationships maintained with local communities**\n\nRenta 4's activities and events are advertised through the web, social networks, and local media (radio, newspapers, etc). Special emphasis is placed on offering specialised information in collaborative formats through local newspapers and radio stations.\n\nThe establishment of Renta 4 in the country through its wide network of offices in all provincial capitals generates an economic impact on employment and the outsourcing of suppliers for maintenance and several other service activities to sustain the branches that function locally.\n\nRenta 4 is a national benchmark in investment services and capital markets. Its presence throughout Spain, in every provincial capital, is proof of its commitment to society as a whole to democratise investment, based on the belief that investment is one of the main engines for improving people's lives.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 Banco has continued to work throughout 2023 to integrate information and operational tools that allow investors to carry out their investment activity considering sustainability factors in an increasingly detailed way. The purpose is to enter data and elements to filter and select the assets and agents that fit their SRI criteria.\n\nThe Corporate activity of Renta 4 includes the analysis and access to financing for small companies to support their growth and eventual IPO. This activity is combined with local offices to offer SMEs these possibilities, so we consider that it has a very positive impact on local areas.\n\nThe entity participates in the initiative for financial pedagogical education for young people \"Your Finance, Your Future\" promoted by the Spanish Association of Banking, in which employees volunteer in colleges or institutes nationwide giving \n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial training to students between 15 and 17 years old. Renta 4 has been actively collaborating in this initiative since its inception and in 2024, will continue to collaborate.\n\nRenta 4 is a member of the Madrid Futuro programme, to work together with many other companies that want to collaborate in generating impact changes, to guarantee a better future for this society.\n\nIn addition, a large number of training activities on financial matters are carried out in order to bring these aspects of financial literacy closer to local citizens, as described above.\n\n#### **5. Outsourcing of suppliers**\n\nRenta 4 is firmly committed to carrying out supplier selection, outsourcing and sub-contracting activities following the principles of contribution to society and its sustainability. To this end, the supplier selection process takes into account the terms of financial due diligence, a number of internal policies and adaptability to future service needs.\n\nTo this end, a policy and procedure for outsourcing services and functions has been drawn up, which contemplates the set of analysis, monitoring and review activities to be carried out in order to ensure that the third parties contracted comply with the minimum conditions and requirements demanded to achieve adequate mitigation of the inherent risks associated with the function or activity to be performed by the third party.\n\nIn addition to the policy, it has developed a methodology on how to proceed with third parties in each of the phases of their life cycle (contracting, provision and end of service). Complementing the methodology, a tool has been defined for the evaluation of outsourcing, which allows an assessment to be made of the inherent risks associated with the services to be outsourced and to evaluate the suitability of the supplier from the point of view of risk minimisation, taking into account environmental, social and human rights protection criteria.\n\n## **The Three Pillars of the Procedure for Assessing the Inherent Risks Associated with Outsourcing Services**\n\n#### **1. Commitment to Prepare Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\nThe selection of suppliers is carried out using established procedures to mitigate the aforementioned risks and to have measures in place to control them, these procedures being dynamic, thus allowing them to be adapted to possible changes that may occur over time.\n\nThe procedures are grouped in the RFP (Request For Proposal)document, in which the requirements associated with the product or services are included, in order to have an objective reference as to the suitability of the suppliers assessed.\n\n#### **2. Transversal Impact Analysis**\n\nThe selection of suppliers is always based on a transversal analysis of the various Renta 4 areas, represented in three functional verticals:\n\n#### · Technology (security area)\n\n· Business (Marketing, Digital Development, others)\n\n· Compliance (Compliance, Risks, Continuity, Privacy, others)\n\nThese analyses are carried out by people responsible for each project or area, depending on how the activity is performed at any given time and through the corresponding meetings and reports, and they are supervised individually by the Management.\n\n#### **3. Internal Committees:**\n\n1. Security Committee\n\nThis is the body that evaluates recently developed projects or the continuity of activities from an information security point of view, related to how they are executed and what suppliers are engaged in it. It is one of the elements that guarantee compliance with the above-mentioned principles and the application of defined procedures.\n\n2. Suppliers Committee\n\nThis is the body in charge of managing suppliers' IT risks, handling their approval and review, in coordination with the areas involved depending on the supplier or service.\n\n3. ESG Committee\n\nThis is the body that approves the procedures related to ESG or similar matters, and that shall adopt decisions related to their possible noncompliance by third parties.\n\n# **5.1. Description of supplier monitoring and audit systems**\n\nThe correct development of Renta 4's activities through its processes depends, to a large extent, on the suppliers involved. The correct management of these directly affects operations, projects and,\n\nultimately, both the non-financial and financial impact on society. A significant percentage of Renta 4's activities are carried out by outsourcing services to suppliers, as reflected in the percentage of expenditure and investment they represent.\n\nThe main risks affecting the organisation in terms of engagement with sub-contractors and suppliers are organised in two main blocks: IT risks (related to Information Technology) and non-IT risks.\n\n#### **IT Risks**\n\nFirstly, with regard to the **main IT risks**, the following three main areas with possible risk implications are distinguished and listed together with the potential impact that could result from them:\n\n· Privacy: inadequate management of personal data by its suppliers whose data controller is Renta 4 could lead to claims and even significant sanctions from the AEPD, mainly derived from the possibility of non-compliance with current data protection regulations, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in addition to the potential reputational impact derived from this.\n\n· Continuity: risks arising from inadequate management of processes related to the Group's operational resilience and effective incident management, the impact of which may be accentuated if there is no adequate framework for action agreed with suppliers/sub-contractors.\n\n· IT security: risks of security incidents or breaches arising from the implementation of an incorrect selection of security measures associated with the provision of the different services.\n\n#### **Non-IT Risks**\n\nOn the other hand, the main **non-IT risks** to which the organisation could be exposed are set out below:\n\n· Quality and compliance risks: are those that arise in relation to the possibility that the supplier does not comply with the quality levels required by Renta 4, as well as the different SLAs established.\n\n· Reputational risks: arising from the possibility of the supplier being involved in bad practices or illegal activities, as well as regulatory breaches which, due to being in the public domain, affect Renta 4's brand image.\n\n· Financial risks: these are the risks that arise in the event that the relationship with the supplier generates a financial impact on the group that is not aligned with the service or product contracted, either due to incorrect compliance resulting from insolvency or due to the supplier's liquidity problems.\n\n· Operational risks: resulting from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, personnel and systems, or from external events. In particular, errors by information and pricing providers, or intrusions into technological systems that could jeopardise the security of the Group's infrastructure.\n\n· Sustainability or ESG risks: include, as a nonfinancial risk, the losses associated with poor performance, or the lack of sufficient measures to achieve better environmental protection, social development with cohesion criteria and economic growth that generates equitable wealth under appropriate internal governance of the company.\n\n# **5.2. Description of supplier monitoring and audit systems**\n\nAlthough Renta 4 does not have specific supervision systems or audits in environmental matters due to the low level of materialisation of this impact on the Group's financial activity, suppliers are periodically supervised and audited both by the various areas on a discretionary basis, and in accordance with Renta 4's transversal supervision systems. Given the growing importance of monitoring the security of suppliers, an outsourcing policy has been formalized that includes , a review and approval of suppliers prior to contracting, taking into account issues such as, inter alia, certifications, security, continuity, data protection, cloud resources, human resources,\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nhuman rights, equality, etc. In this regard, the approval of suppliers is reviewed periodically, preferably annually, taking into account human rights and sustainability criteria, and being able to certify or audit compliance with them.\n\nMoreover, a series of audits of the third-party risk management process have been carried out in accordance with the previously defined audit plan. As a result of these audit efforts, several points for improvement have been identified and action plans have been defined to remedy them.\n\nWith regard to the protection of customer assets, Renta 4's own processes and those of third-party suppliers are audited by external auditors on an annual basis, in order to demonstrate the correct safeguarding and protection of customer funds and assets. Furthermore, in accordance with regulations, Renta 4 has a person responsible for the asset protection function, who is responsible for monitoring the activity of third parties.\n\nThe main supplier supervision systems identified are the project or activity committees, which involve several areas and are ultimately overseen by the General Management, and other formally established committees, including the Security Committee, the Supplier Committee and the ESG Committee.\n\n#### **6. Consumers**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group is an company specialised in the provision of investment services and high-quality asset management, whose principles are based on proximity to clients and specialisation, offering a wide range of products and high-quality advice for client satisfaction, one of the main purposes of Renta 4.\n\nIn accordance with Order ECO/734/2004, dated March 11, on the client departments and services of financial institutions, the Client Service Department of Renta 4, (hereinafter, CSD) has the **main function of processing and solving the complaints and claims submitted by clients.** To this end, Renta 4 has set up different channels for the effective submission of complaints and/or claims:\n\n- · Email: defensor@renta4.es\n- · Renta 4 website https://www.r4.com/ through the customer's logged-in account (with digital certificate)\n- · Postal address: Paseo de la Habana nº 74, 28036, Madrid\n- · In person at any of Renta 4's offices\n\n· customers or users can also make complaints to the Consumer Affairs offices of their Town Council or Autonomous Community.\n\nComplaints received through any of the channels mentioned are sent to the CSD to first determine whether or not they are to be processed. Then, once they have been accepted, we proceed to the study and detailed analysis of each of the issues raised, reviewing the procedures established by Renta 4 and finally issuing the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nThe evolution in the number of claims submitted, admitted and processed by the CSD is shown below, classified by the type of resolution issued.\n\n#### **Evolution of Complaints Submitted to the Ccs - Classification by Type Of Resolution**\n\n|                                                  | 2023 |     | 2022 |     | 2021 |     | 2020 |     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|\n| Classification by type of resolution             | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   |\n| Against the customer                             | 11   | 37% | 19   | 49% | 23   | 61% | 15   | 34% |\n| In favour of the customer                        | 6    | 20% | 3    | 8%  | 4    | 11% | 5    | 11% |\n| Proposal for a compromise of the SAC (Agreement) | 8    | 27% | 13   | 34% | 6    | 16% | 15   | 34% |\n| Withdrawal of the customer                       | 3    | 10% | 1    | 3%  | 3    | 8%  | 1    | 2%  |\n| Not admitted to processing / suspension          | 0    | 0%  | 1    | 2%  | -    | -   | 1    | 2%  |\n| Pending resolution                               | 2    | 6%  | 2    | 5%  | 2    | 5%  | 7    | 16% |\n| TOTAL                                            | 30   |     | 39   |     | 38   |     | 44   |     |\n\nIn addition, it is reported that the Ombudsman has managed nine cases during 2023. Six have been resolved against the customer, two have been resolved in favour of the customer and one is pending processing.\n\n#### **7. Tax information**\n\nAs regards tax information, according to the provisions of Law 11/2018, in its first section, two V, Renta 4 Banco SA operates in Spain, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Luxembourg. Renta 4 Banco pays direct input taxes (own taxes) and collects others from third parties generated by economic activity and based on its role as a company collaborating with the tax authorities (third party taxes).\n\nIn relation to these countries, the profits obtained in each of them and the taxes on profits paid are specified in the following figures (in thousands of euros):\n\n|                           | Total  | Luxembourg | Colombia | Chile | Peru | Spain  |\n|---------------------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|------|--------|\n| Profit before tax         | 36,365 | -119       | 1,188    | 3,171 | 794  | 31,331 |\n| Income Tax15              | -9,802 |            | 238      | -378  | -111 | -9,551 |\n| Profit after tax          | 26,563 | -119       | 1,426    | 2,793 | 683  | 21,780 |\n| Payable for the year 2022 | 1,895  |            | -505     | 265   | 107  | 2,028  |\n\nThe Bank and the rest of the Group companies are subject to other taxes, besides income tax, the most important one is the tax on deposits in credit entities, which amounts to €528,000. During 2023, Renta 4 Banco S.A. did not receive any tax subsidies or public aid in this regard.\n\n15 or other similar\n\nImage /page/175/Picture/26 description: The image shows the number 176 in white font on a green background.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn line with the commitment to nationally and internationally recognised principles, Renta 4 Banco, at group level, joined the United Nations Sustainable Investment Programme in March 2023, and the Principles for Responsible Investment, whereby it undertakes to incorporate environmental, social and corporate governance factors (ESG) in corporate governance and investment decision-making. Renta 4 Gestora has been a member of UNPRI since 2021.\n\n#### **System of Government**\n\nRenta 4 is committed to complying with the various regulations that have emerged in the field of sustainability. To this end, Renta 4 has carried out the following actions:\n\n- · Assigning ESG functions to employees. In the different strategic areas of the entity to assume their responsibilities for defining and implementing policies and procedures.\n- · Establishment of an ESG committee. Responsible for the coordination and supervision of sustainable investment initiatives.\n- · Hiring an external consultant specialised in ESG in the financial sector. To make checkpoints of documentation and regulatory requirements, reports and, at the same time, train the areas.\n- · Definition and periodic review of an ESG policy at the group level and, where necessary, ESG policies at the business unit or department level, as well as the definition of investment procedures aligned with these policies.\n\n#### **ESG Policy**\n\nRenta 4 has an ESG policy, the aim of which is to provide a global framework in which the general principles and procedures for the incorporation of ESG criteria are set out in a standardised and homogeneous way. Additionally Renta 4 Gestora and Asset Management have their own policy.\n\n<span id=\"page-176-0\"></span>ESG Commitment · Strategy and business. Renta 4 is committed to promoting investments that minimise negative impacts, and to promoting the integration of ESG criteria in the development of its activity at corporate level.\n\n> · Products and services. Development of a catalogue of sustainable products and services to complement its current offer and to respond to current market demands within the ESG field.\n\n> · Risk management. Integration of ESG risks into Renta 4's strategic or investment decision-making.\n\n· Transparency. Towards both our clients and stakeholders, communicating Renta 4's positioning and performance in the ESG area.\n\n· Governance. Integration of ESG criteria into Renta 4's strategy, decision-making, roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe integration of ESG criteria into the group's policies contributes to the care of the planet, society and our customers' investments. In addition to financial criteria, Socially Responsible Investment (ESG) criteria are applied, which follow investment strategies based on exclusionary and valuation criteria.\n\n## **From the Perspective of Renta 4 Banco as a Marketer of Financial Products,**\n\nRenta 4 offers its customers a series of responsible investment products selected through a qualitative analysis on the application of ESG criteria (both at the management level and at the investment fund level) and quantitative information provided by external suppliers. Renta 4 is in the process of integrating ESG and sustainable risk criteria for services offered to the public, such as portfolio management and advisory services, in which they are asked about their preferences for sustainable investment.\n\n## **From the Perspective of Renta 4 Gestora as Creator of Financial Products,**\n\nThrough materiality maps, provided by external suppliers, the criteria that are most relevant in each of the sectors are analysed. These analyses are complemented by a dialogue between managers and analysts with the companies in which they invest. 100% of the funds managed by Renta 4 integrate the ESG criteria.\n\n#### **Regulatory Compliance**\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, Renta 4 has worked to comply with the following regulatory requirements as the different milestones set by regulatory bodies were reached.\n\n· Sustainability Annexes: Required by the CNMV to the managers for each fund that promotes or aims for sustainable investments.\n\n· Calculation of the carbon footprint: A methodology has been established for the calculation of the carbon footprint (scopes 1, 2 and 3) according to the GHG Protocol. The carbon footprint calculation model for 2021 has been developed and has already been applied for the calculation of 2022 and 2023,\n\n· Training and awareness: a series of training and awareness-raising sessions have been promoted for the board of directors as well as for the staff of the organisation. These sessions are repeated periodically with updated regulations and requirements.\n\n· Suitability test: Implementation of the required changes in the information to customers, implementation of the processes to meet the regulatory requirements that, with the available information, can be fulfilled.\n\n· EU taxonomy: The consistency and traceability of the databases has been improved, and the systems have been adapted to the taxonomy changes (eligibility and alignment of companies).\n\n· Main adverse incidents: Timely reporting of the main adverse incidents on financial assets is made, both from Renta 4 Banco and Renta 4 Gestora.\n\n## **1. SDG 1 – Provide quality education**\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/32 description: The image shows a close-up of a graphic element. The text \"EDUCACIÓN DE CALIDAD\" is visible at the top, written in a sans-serif font and a light brown color. Below the text is a simple line drawing of a pencil, also in a light brown color. The background is a light beige or cream color.\n\nOne of the objectives of sustainable development to which the entity has committed itself is to provide quality education. Renta 4 has been committed to this goal for many years,\n\nconvinced that there are two levers that favour the progress of society and people:\n\n· one is investment, capital markets, as sources of financing for private companies to develop and thrive, and when the business fabric progresses, societies progress\n\n· the other is education, training and preparation of people from the most fundamental levels of education to the most advanced and specialised.\n\nRenta 4 wants to create an impact in both dimensions and while one is inherent in its own business activity, the other is acquired as a social commitment.\n\nThus, in 2023 the Board of Directors approved the SDG proposed by the ESG Committee to progressively increase the donation to cultural or educational projects to the most disadvantaged groups to reach 0.7% of net benefits in 2025.\n\n**In 2023, the total amount donated to projects that promote culture or education amounted to 167,475.00 euros, with net profits in the year of 26.6 Mn €. This represents 0.63% of the net profit.**\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. SDG 2 – GHG emission neutrality**\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/3 description: The image shows a logo with the text \"ACCIÓN POR EL CLIMA\" (Climate Action) above a green leaf symbol. The leaf is stylized with a simple outline and a single vertical line representing the stem.\n\nIn its commitment to environmental protection, the Board of Directors of Renta 4 approved the SDG throughout 2023 to achieve operational GHG emission neutrality by 2025.\n\nA model was developed in 2022 to calculate the carbon footprint of Scopes 1 and 2 and of the activities relevant to Renta 4 in Scope 3. The calculation was based on emissions data for the entities that comprise the Renta 4 Group and its controlled operations.\n\nThe methodology implemented in the calculation of Renta 4's carbon footprint is based on:\n\n· GHG Protocol according to the ECCR standard (Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard)\n\n· The indications of the MITECO (Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge)\n\n· The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) guidance: The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry.\n\nEach year, with the results obtained in terms of carbon emissions, a final report is produced with the conclusions and key points, at a high level, and possible actions to be to be taken in an action plan for the following year, in order to encourage the reduction of the footprint.\n\nA more detailed summary on the calculation of the carbon footprint can be found in the environment section of this document.\n\nThe result of the calculation of the operational emissions carbon footprint calculated for 2023 was 1,046.86 of tCO2eq, 4.7% more than in 2022 (999.91 tCO2eq), corresponding to the sum of Scope 1 emissions, 2 and scope 3 operational.\n\nDespite this small growth, the results of the first phase of the SDG for 2023, focusing on those emissions generated by Scope 2, have been very positive. These are described below.\n\n#### **Summary Table of the Variation in the Calculation of the Carbon Footprint Between 2022 and 2023**\n\n| Operational GHG emissions        | Emissions (t CO₂ eq) 2022 | Emissions (t CO₂ eq) 2023 | Change Emissions '22-'23 (%) |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Scope 1                          | 87.02                     | 98.49                     | 13.19%                       |\n| Scope 2                          | 109.76                    | 72.05                     | -34.36%                      |\n| Branches                         | 85.11                     | 28.04                     | -67.05%                      |\n| Head office                      | 13.85                     | 3.95                      | -71.48%                      |\n| Total Spain                      | 98.95                     | 32                        | -67.66%                      |\n| International                    | 10.81                     | 40.06                     | 270.58%                      |\n| Scope 3 operational              | 803.13                    | 854.40                    | 6.38%                        |\n| 1.

This is one of the most satisfactory measures since they seek neutrality not by GHG compensation but directly by the non-emission of CO2.**\n\nThis initiative shows that GHG emissions in Spain have been reduced by 67.66% compared to 2022. In Luxembourg this reduction has been 100% since the change has been made since the beginning of the year. In total, Scope 2 has reduced emissions by 34.36% in 2023.\n\nThis has succeeded in overcoming the first milestone on the decarbonisation route. In 2024, it is planned to launch actions to try to achieve GHG neutrality of full operational scopes 1 and 2, leaving by 2025 the last operational decarbonisation target, generated by Scope 3.\n\n#### **3. SDG 3 – Democratisation of investment**\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/20 description: The image shows a close-up of a poster or document with the words \"REDUCCIÓN DE DESIGUALDADES\" in a bold, sans-serif font. The text is in a warm, brownish-orange color, and it appears to be the title or heading of the document. Below the text, there are two stylized symbols or icons, also in the same brownish-orange color. The background of the poster is a light, creamy color, providing a soft contrast to the text and symbols. The overall impression is that the document is related to the topic of reducing inequalities.\n\nAnother SDG to which Renta 4 has made a firm commitment is to reduce inequalities.\n\nConsequently, with the entity's vision \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE And SOCIETY\", that is, the belief that investment is a lever of social and individual progress, in Renta 4 it is believed that precisely society and people should be able to access investment without the knowledge, time or size of their savings being an impediment, \"DEMOCRATISING INVESTMENT\".\n\nThis is why, over the course of this year, it has been added among the objectives to have a cumulative impact until 2025, at least 7% of the workforce, with the message that access to investment services and products is available to all.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, an \"INVESTMENT FOR ALL\" campaign has been launched with a media plan on the main social networks with video formats, posts, etc.\n\nRenta 4 @Renta4 27 dic\n\n[#INVERSION PARA TODOS] ¿Ya sabes a qué mercado acudir para empezar a invertir? \n\n¡Dale al play y descúbrelo! ow.ly/PEWRSOQHNG\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/27 description: The image shows a graphic with a stock chart and the text \"El unico mercado que tienes que conocer para empezar a invertir\".\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/28 description: A tweet from Renta 4 that says \"[INVERSIÓN PARA TODOS] Para empezar a invertir sólo necesitas este bono... ¿Sabes cuál es?\"\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/31 description: The image shows a video with a cartoon drawing of a building and a bus.

EU ESG taxonomy**\n\nDelegated Regulation EU 2178/2021 and its subsequent amendment to Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023 in development of Regulation EU 852/2020, specify the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed by financial and non-financial undertakings subject to the reporting obligation of the Non-Financial Reporting Statement (in Avanten SNFI.) in the framework of environmentally sustainable activities.\n\nThis regulatory requirement is based on the ESG taxonomy established in EU Regulation 852/2020. The ESG taxonomy establishes a regulatory framework with the aim of harmonising at European level the consideration of sustainable economic activities in relation to the following climate objectives:\n\n- **1.** Climate change mitigation.\n- **2.** Adaptation to climate change.\n- **3.** Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.\n- **4.** Transition to a circular economy.\n- **5.** Prevention and control of pollution.\n- **6.** Protection and recovery of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe technical criteria for considering that an economic activity contributes substantially to meeting the objectives of mitigation and adaptation to climate change are defined in Delegated Regulation EU 2139/2021 and extended in Delegated Regulation EU 2485/2023. The technical criteria for considering that an economic activity contributes substantially to the fulfilment of each of the other objectives are regulated in Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023. These regulations also specify the criteria to be met by economic activities in order to consider that they do not cause significant harm to each of the climate objectives.\n\n# <span id=\"page-178-0\"></span>Taxonomy\n\nIn this way, the ESG taxonomy establishes the relationship of environmental objectives with the economic activities eligible for each of the climate objectives, and the requirements to evaluate the alignment of the economic activities carried out by companies with the aforementioned objectives\n\nFor these purposes, an economic activity eligible as environmentally sustainable (aligned with the taxonomy) is considered to the extent that it meets the following requirements:\n\n**1.** Contribute substantially to one or more environmental objectives.\n\n**2.** It does not cause significant harm to any of the environmental objectives.\n\n**3.** The minimum guarantees laid down in the regulations are complied with.\n\n**4.** It conforms to the technical criteria established in the regulations.\n\nEach company subject to publication of the SNFI shall assess and disclose to what extent it carries out and is exposed to the economic activities eligible for each of the objectives, and to what extent these activities are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore taxonomy-aligned.\n\nFor the aforementioned evaluation, the nature of the economic activity, its orientation to meet some of the climate objectives, and the impact it implies for the company using the key performance indicators indicated in the aforementioned regulation. In particular, the extent to which activities considered as transitional or facilitative activities are aligned, in accordance with the regulations, shall also be disclosed.\n\nFor these purposes, the Renta 4 Group as a banking group is subject to the preparation and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information, as defined in Annexes V and VI, X of the Delgado EU 2178/2021 Regulation and subsequent developments.\n\nAccording to this regulation, depending on the implementation schedule, and considering the limitations indicated in the \"qualitative information\", credit institutions must measure and evaluate the degree of eligibility and alignment of economic activities (including breakdown of transition and facilitative activities). from eligible counterparties to their operations, in relation to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. To do this, the different key performance indicators defined by the regulations for each type of asset must be taken into account.\n\nThis assessment shall be reflected in the breakdown and calculation of the key performance indicators of credit institutions, generically referred to as Green Asset Ratios (hereinafter referred to as GAR) with respect to the balance sheet exposures in current and flow terms (i.e. new transactions), off-balance sheet exposures, revenue and commissions of certain services and the trading book. The latter two categories are not required until the financial year 2026.\n\nIn order to obtain and process the necessary quantitative and qualitative information, the Renta 4 Group's \"Procedure for assessing the eligibility and alignment of exposures in accordance with the ESG taxonomy\" has been followed. This procedure describes mainly the internal processes for the evaluation of eligibility and alignment of income exposures 4 Banco S.A., both inside and outside the balance sheet.\n\nIn order to comply with this procedure, internal databases have been reviewed, prioritised and updated, and processes have been further automated, allowing for better control and monitoring of these processes. The database has also been enriched by external information providers of recognised prestige in the field.\n\n#### **Quantitative Information**\n\nIn relation to the quantitative information required by the aforementioned regulation, the Renta 4 Group has completed the templates listed in Annex VI, following the instructions set out in Annex V of Delegated Regulation EU 2178/2021, 2021 as well as in subsequent developments, as referred to above\n\nDelegated Regulation EU 2139/2021, Delegated Regulation EU 2485/2023 and Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023,\n\nThe following are templates reflecting quantitative information related to the GARs and key outcome indicators:\n\n# **Template 0: Summary of key Performance Indicators**\n\nThis table includes a summary of key performance indicators described in the following headings, which develop the following data:\n\n· The total of environmentally sustainable assets/ activities broken down climate objectives and globally.\n\n· Results of the GAR considering as key indicators of exposures performance, the turnover indicator and the CAPEX indicator.\n\n· The percentage of hedging for each key profit or loss indicator on the Group's total assets.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Template 1: Assets for the Calculation of the Green Asset Ratio (G.A.R.)**\n\nIn this table, with data relating to the financial year 2023, exposures are classified by accounting sectorisation, type of product, and eligibility in the calculation of the ratio of green assets (G.A.R.). The objective of this calculation is to obtain the amount of eligibility and the actual alignment of exposures, both on and off the balance sheet with respect to the taxonomy for each climate change mitigation and adaptation objective, based, separately, on the basis of the in the key performance indicators of turnover and CAPEX of counterparties to operations.\n\nIt should be noted that the assets covered by the GAR numerator represent 4.34% of the total assets, while the assets excluded from the numerator, and those excluded from the numerator and denominator, represent respectively 22.10% and 73.56%.\n\nLikewise, the degree of alignment with the taxonomy of those exposures to economic activities considered as facilitators or transition is indicated.\n\n#### **Summary of key

and actual alignment (including breakdown of transition and facilitative activities) of the new balance sheet exposures with the taxonomy for each of the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives is indicated, on the total assets covered by the GAR as defined in template 1.\n\nThe degree of alignment with the taxonomy is reported, separately, based on the key indicators of turnover and CAPEX results. For the purposes of these tables, to assess the degree of eligibility and alignment for each of the environmental objectives for mitigation and adaptation to climate change of exposures representing new net lending for the financial year 2023, the proportion they represent on the total eligible new net loans for that year is calculated.\n\nIt should be noted that new assets covered by the GAR numerator represent 7.91% of total new assets, while new assets excluded from the numerator, and those excluded from the numerator and denominator, respectively represent 72.45% and 19.34%.\n\nImage /page/188/Picture/11 description: The image shows a close-up of a white, textured surface. The texture appears to be composed of small, irregular shapes that create a pattern of light and shadow. The overall impression is one of subtle depth and variation in the surface.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **GAR Key Outcomes Indicator in terms of flow based on

           |\n\n#### **Qualitative Information**\n\nThe subjective scope of application of the ESG taxonomy reaches the entire prudential consolidable group and prudential consolidable group.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative information presented below, we include information that completes and allows a greater understanding of the evaluation of the degree to which the economic activities of the Renta 4 Group are eligible and aligned with the ESG taxonomy.\n\nIn this regard, the following qualitative aspects should be highlighted:\n\n· Business model of Renta 4\n\nRenta 4's business model is mainly based on the provision of intermediation and management of asset services to customers, meaning that demand deposits from our customers mainly take the form of the following assets: short and medium-term debt issues of central and regional governments, as well as in Eurosystem deposits and in current accounts of Credit Institutions, subject to prudential supervision and domiciled in States belonging to the European Union, which are high-liquidity and low-risk assets with the aim of preserving the economic value of the sums deposited by customers.\n\nThus, at the end of 2023 approximately 73% of the exposures on the balance sheet are excluded for the purposes of calculating the numerator and denominator of the GAR, representing exposures to central banks by 41%, exposures to central administrations and supranational issuers by 30%, and exposures classified as trading book by 2%.\n\nIn addition, the Renta 4 Group, in a less relevant way, provides financing activities, mainly materialised in the granting of credit for investment, supported practically entirely by the creation of collateral considered effective. This financing operation, since it does not aim to finance the economic activities of the accredited person, does not constitute one of the economic activities considered eligible, nor aligned with the European taxonomy.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with this regulation, all the financing activity carried out by the Group is considered to have a generic objective, assigning the degree of eligibility and alignment of operations to each of the climate objectives required according to the relative weight represented by the exposures to counterparties over the total eligible and aligned activities according to each key risk indicator used.\n\n· Data sources and taxonomy implementation calendar\n\nIn the search for data relating to the assessment of the degree of eligibility and alignment of counterparty exposures with respect to the climate objectives of the taxonomy, both the search for public sources of counterparty information has been used, as well as external suppliers specialised in the matter.\n\nWith regard to the limitation in these public sources, it should be noted that, according to the calendar for the application of the taxonomy, at the end of 2022, only non-financial companies were obliged to disclose the degree of eligibility and alignment of their economic activities. All other financial companies will be obliged to disclose this information in this financial year.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that, until this year, only the eligibility requirements for environmental objectives for climate change mitigation and adaptation had been established. In the 2023 financial year, through Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023, the requirements of economic activities to be their eligibility in relation to the rest of the environmental objectives were regulated, as well as the technical criteria for considering those economic activities as environmentally sustainable (aligned with the taxonomy).\n\nbe highlighted:\n\nidar\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this regard, taking into account the lack of mandatory reporting of financial institutions, the absence of the possibility of temporary comparability of information reported by non-financial companies, and the limitation of this to only two previously regulated climate objectives, it makes it difficult to properly assess the contribution of companies to achieving the objectives.\n\nIn the case of external information providers, it should be noted that they also suffer from the limited availability of information from public sources for the reasons mentioned above.\n\n#### · Limitations in the target area\n\nThe Renta 4 Group does not have financial guarantees supporting debt instruments, therefore, according to the regulations, they fall outside the scope of this document\n\nIn addition, the underlying assets managed by managers will not be broken down in this financial year in view of the operational difficulties involved.\n\nTherefore, the scope of the assessment of the degree of eligibility and alignment of off-balance sheet assets will be limited to assets managed and deposited in Group companies that are managers.\n\n· Additional information regarding the estimated eligibility for the four environmental objectives regulated in the financial year 2023, and the first two objectives for companies other than non-financial corporations\n\nIn this table, the potential degree of eligibility of the economic activities of counterparties is estimated for each of four environmental objectives covered by Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023, by matching the NACE of the counterparty and the eligible activities in the taxonomy for each of the objectives.\n\nAlso derived from the taxonomy implementation schedule, it is included in the following table.\n\n**Potential degree of eligibility of financial counterparts' economic activities, with respect to climate

It would move from a \"soft landing\" scenario to a \"no landing\" scenario.\n\n**That optimistic outlook has driven the sharp gains of the stock exchanges in the last quarter of 2023** and in the first months of 2024. Some increases that have had as main protagonists, again, the big technology companies and, in particular, those linked to generative artificial intelligence. Some of these companies have accumulated higher than 70% in just two months, after having revalued more than 200% in the previous year.\n\n**Bond markets have not shared that extreme optimism** and have performed much more moderately in the first months of this year, **which moves us to think about possible excesses** in the rises of the stock exchanges and other risky assets, such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. **Such excesses would be due, among other factors, to the abundant liquidity** that is still in the system, since only a small part of the money injected by the central banks in the wake of the pandemic has been withdrawn.\n\n**As we mentioned at last year's Shareholders' Meeting, in our opinion the global economy has entered a phase of profound transformation since 2022,** guided by four structural changes, all of which are longterm. The change of the monetary regime, abandoning the ultra-expansionary monetary policies that had dominated the scene for a decade and a half. The shift toward a growth model based on productivity rather than excessive debt accumulation. The change of geopolitical environment toward controlled deglobalisation. And, finally, the entry of the economy into a phase of permanent and transversal disruptive innovation. There are four processes of great depth, which move us to think about a period of long adjustment.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n**A period of adjustment that has not ended and that, in exchange for being long, will not be, in our opinion, traumatic, but orderly.** For the first time, central banks can aspire to deflate the economy without causing a major recession, and that is the main novelty of the post-COVID economy, an economy whose main characteristic is the profound transformation that affects all sectors, in a total and transversal way, and that determines changes in lifestyles, in business models, in the way of producing energy and even in food production systems.\n\n**From that positive long-term view, however, we do not share the optimism, in our view excessive, of thinking that the changes are over and that the economy will immediately enter a stage of high growth.** We think rather that the four processes described above will continue, because their development takes time and because the changes mentioned also require a huge volume of investment.\n\n**In this standardised context, but, I insist, not euphoric,** the role of Renta 4 Banco is more necessary than ever, because large investment processes will obtain most of the necessary financial resources through the financial markets, including the so-called private equity and direct lending markets and not through traditional bank financing, via the balance sheet, which is not designed to finance innovation. As we said last year, the financial system is evolving from a system designed to finance industrial society to a system that must finance the new knowledge society, in which the financing of innovation and transformation is absolutely key.\n\n**That is why we have strengthened and will continue to strengthen all operational areas that improve our ability to help companies** in their processes of change and transformation, presenting them with assistance and financial advice, and we will also continue to improve the access of savers to investments, with the help of new technological tools and with the permanent improvement of the quality of our human teams, which in the end are the true key to our differentiated services offered to the market.\n\n**With this philosophy of quality, but at the same time of closeness, Renta 4 Banco has once again reached historical records in 2023** both in the opening of new customer accounts and in the entry of new customer assets. The number of customers of the own network at the end of 2023 was 124,995 compared to 118,542 a year earlier, and the total assets of customers administered or managed by our Bank at the end of 2023 was €30,852 million compared to €26,370 million a year ago. The net inflow of customer assets in the year was €2,511 million, which represents a new record, surpassing the figure of 2022 that had also been record.\n\n**The financial margin** has behaved very well in 2023, totalling €23.2 million, thanks to having maintained an extremely liquid balance sheet invested in high-quality short-term monetary instruments. **The result of financial** operations, which was €10.99 million, has also performed well.\n\n**Grupo Renta 4 net profit in 2023 amounted to €26.6 million,** 21.9% higher than the previous year. It is the largest profit of Renta 4 Banco in its history, and we have achieved it by maintaining a capital ratio \"CET1 Fully Loaded\" of 18.62%, which far exceeds the level of regulatory requirement and, likewise, far exceeds that of the other banks. At the same time, the Return on Capital (ROE) in 2023 was 18.8%. This return on invested capital is well above that of the rest of Spanish and European banks. This shows that it is not incompatible to have a high capital and a high return on capital.\n\n**These high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios that allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.** Last November we distributed a dividend on account of 0.3 euros per share and today we propose to the Board, for approval, a dividend of 0.12 euros per share, that is, a total of 0.42 euros per share, what about a closing quote of 10.20 euros per share represents a dividend return for the shareholder of 4.1%.\n\n**The commercial activity continues to maintain very good levels in the first three months of 2024** and this reaffirms us in our position as a specialised bank that offers the savers a wide range of solutions to invest in a simple and profitable way their wealth, and to companies financing solutions through the financial markets and private equity and direct lending. We have a unique business model, a business model that creates value for our customers and our shareholders, and that's what sets us apart from our competitors.\n\n**We are beginning to see the first fruits of the Plus Plan,** launched two years ago, an ambitious plan aimed at offering a wider range of solutions to even wider customer segments. offering at the same time easier access to these services and solutions. The private equity offer has continued to increase, we have strengthened corporate operations teams, we have advanced interactive digital solutions and thematic investment, and we have improved and expanded banking services to our customers, to facilitate their operations. **We are aware that achieving all the objectives of the Plus Plan will take time and require a lot of effort, but I believe that we are in the right direction** and that the increase in customers and customer assets that I mentioned above are only the first fruits of that Plan, whose complete development will generate huge value for Renta 4 Banco. We are going to put the greatest effort into achieving this.\n\n**Subsidiaries in Chile, Peru and Colombia have continued to increase their activity.** Today we can say that we are already established in those three countries, where we have exceeded €10 million in revenue and €3 million in profit after tax. We expect a lot from our presence in Latin America, which, without a doubt, is one of the engines of growth of Renta 4 Banco.\n\n**We are in a very competitive sector, which is undergoing a profound transformation.** In our opinion **that transformation will not only continue, but will go further in the coming years.** We are prepared to face the changes that may come, and we will do so from a solid position of balance and from a very clear understanding of what are the main lines of evolution of our activity.\n\n**I now turn to corporate social responsibility.** Starting with job creation, the average workforce in 2022 has risen to 657 people, an increase of 3.8%. Face-to-face work in offices has now become normalised, although partial remote working has now become the norm for a large part of the workforce.\n\n**In 2023, the Renta 4 Foundation continued to support various programmes** related to the education of underprivileged and disabled people. We maintain the programs with Foundations such as A.G.H., Martinez Hermanos, Agua de Coco, Granadown, Prodis, ADF or Procivism, and we add to them the new programmes that the employees submit and vote for every year. Between direct assignment and open voting funding, there are a total of 14 solidarity projects.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 participates directly in specific actions, ensuring that they are always within the charity action area that the entity has set. Once again, a part of our staff has collaborated with various NGOs in the preparation and sending of Christmas baskets to disadvantaged families, **and in the field of culture we maintain our membership in the Board of Protectors of the Teatro Real.**\n\n**In the field of financial education we continue to hold numerous events,** courses and seminars to promote the financial culture, in which we have had more than 17,000 registered throughout the year. In addition, our blog \"From Saver to Investor\" has had more than 128,000 unique users in 2023. All this complemented with more than 145 courses and conferences that are taught in an open and free way directly in our network of offices, and with the campaign \"Investment for all\" that transposes a concept of democratization of investment and that in 2023 has exceeded 800,000 views in the main social networks.\n\nFinally, **as always and as is my duty, I would like to say thank you to** our shareholders and customers or their trust, without which none of the above would be possible, and the entire Renta 4 team for their work, dedication and enormous talent, which is undoubtedly our company's most valuable asset.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5**\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\n# **06**\n\n**Consolidated income statements of Renta 4 Banco,

(hereinafter, \"the Bank\" or \"the Parent Company\") is the entity resulting from the merger by absorption which took place on 30 March 2011, of Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión S.A., (absorbing entity) and Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (absorbed entity), previously called Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A., the change of name of the latter having been registered in the Trade Registry on 8 June 2011. In addition, in the merger process, amendments were made to the bylaws of the absorbing company, changing its name from Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión, S.A. to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and extending its corporate purpose to include banking activities, as well as investment and ancillary services typical of investment services companies. The Parent Company is registered in the Trade Registry and in the Special Register of Credit Institutions of the Bank of Spain under code 0083.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, the Directorate General of the Treasury and Financial Policy under the Ministry of Economy and Finance approved the partial spin-off of branches of activity of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores in favour of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nBy virtue of this spin-off, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores transferred to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. all of its assets and liabilities assigned to certain branches of activity of the spun-off company, which constitute \"an economic unit\" and which were transferred en bloc by universal succession to Renta 4 Banco, S.A., with this company acquiring as beneficiary of the spin-off, by universal succession, all of the assets and liabilities, rights and obligations comprising the aforementioned spun-off assets.\n\nThe balance sheet of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores as at 31 December 2010 was considered as the spin-off balance sheet. All transactions carried out by the assets spun off from Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores are considered to have been carried out for accounting purposes on behalf of Renta Banco, S.A. since 1 January 2011.\n\nAs a result of the spin-off, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, transferred net assets to Renta 4 Banco, S.A., amounting to €13.63 million, which represented 48.418% of the total net assets of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores before the spin-off. Therefore, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores reduced its capital by the necessary amount of €2,944,826.61 by amortising shares numbered 1,047,869 to 2,031,485 inclusive.\n\nThe Parent Company's corporate purpose consists of the activities of credit institutions in general, including the provision of investment services, as well as the acquisition, holding, use, administration and disposal of all kinds of transferable securities, and in particular those determined in article 175 of the Commercial Code and other legislation in force relating to the activity of such institutions. It also includes the provision of all kinds of services and consulting, whether economic, financial, tax, stock market, organisational, mechanisation or of any other kind, and to carry out company valuation studies, as well as the placement and negotiation of securities of all kinds of movable and immovable assets belonging to third parties.\n\nThe activity or activities that constitute the corporate purpose may also be carried on by the Parent Company, wholly or partially, indirectly, through the ownership of shares or equity interests in companies with an identical or similar purpose.\n\nThe Parent Company has its registered office in Madrid, Paseo de la Habana 74. By agreement of the Administrative Body, it may be transferred within the same municipal area where it is established. Likewise, offices, agencies or delegations may be created, removed or transferred as required by the development of the company's business, both in Spain and abroad. The Parent Company's balance sheet, income statement, statement of recognised income and expenses, statement of total changes in equity and statement of cash flows as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are included in Annex IV.\n\nThe Parent Company is the head of an economic and consolidable group of credit institutions (hereinafter \"the Group\"). The activities of subsidiaries and associates are included in Annex I. During the year there have been no changes in the name of the parent company of the group.\n\nThe activities carried out by the most representative companies of the Group are regulated by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015 of 23 October, approving the revised text of the Securities Market Law, by Law 47/2007 of 19 December and by Royal Decree 217/2008 of 15 February, as well as the various Circulars of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) that implement it. The management of collective investment institutes is also regulated by Law 35/2003 of 4 November 2003 and subsequent amendments thereto, and by Royal Decree 1082/2012 of 13 July 2012, applicable as from 21 July 2012, and subsequent amendments thereto, which approves the Regulations implementing Law 35/2003 of 4 November 2003 and replaces Royal\n\nDecree 1309/2005 of 4 November 2005 by repealing it. In addition, the pension fund management activity is regulated by Royal Decree 1/2002, of 29 November, approving the revised text of the law regulating Pension Plans, implemented by Royal Decree 304/2004, of 20 February, approving the Regulations of Pension Plans and Funds and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\nAs a credit institution, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. is subject to certain legal regulations which govern, among others, aspects such as:\n\n- **a)Minimum Reserve Ratio** Maintenance of a minimum percentage of reserve holdings with a national central bank of a country participating in the single currency (euro) to cover the minimum reserve ratio. At 31 December 2023 and 2022 Renta 4 Banco, S.A. complied with the minimum requirements.\n- **b)Own Resources -** Maintenance of a minimum level of own resources. In short, the regulations stipulate the obligation to maintain sufficient own funds to cover the requirements of the risks incurred. At 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group and the Parent Company complied with the minimum requirements in this respect (see note 18.i).\n- **c) Liquidity Ratio** Article 412 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter CRR) requires compliance with the liquidity requirement, which is further developed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. This requirement applies to credit institutions at the individual level (Article 6.4 of the CRR) and at the consolidated level of the parent company (Article 11.3 of the CRR) as of 1 October 2015.\n\nIt has been adopted in accordance with the following calendar:\n\n- **• 60% of the liquidity coverage requirement as of 1 October 2015.**\n- **• 70% from 1 January 2016.**\n- **• 80% from 1 January 2017.**\n- **• 100% from 1 January 2018.**\n\nThe liquidity ratio at 31 December 2023 and 2022 of the Parent Company at individual and Group level is above 100%, which is required as of 1 January 2018.\n\n**d)Annual contribution to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (hereinafter \"DGF\") -** This represents an additional guarantee to that provided by the Bank's own resources to the Bank's creditors, the purpose of which is to guarantee customer deposits up to €100,000 in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, the Bank of Spain published Circular 5/2016 of 27 May 2016 on the calculation method for the contributions of institutions adhering to the Deposit Guarantee Fund for Credit Institutions (DGF) to be proportional to their risk profile, which will be used by the DGF's Management Committee to determine the amount of each institution's annual contributions to the deposit guarantee compartment, taking into account indicators of capital, liquidity and financing, asset quality, business model, management model and potential losses for the DGF.\n\nThe total annual contribution of all member institutions to the DGF's deposit guarantee fund has been set at 1.75 per thousand of the calculation base (1.75 of the calculation base for 2022), made up of the guaranteed money deposits as indicated in section 2.a) of Article 3 of Royal Decree 2606/1996, existing at 31 December 2022, the contribution being calculated on the basis of the amount of the guaranteed deposits and their risk profile.\n\nOn the other hand, the annual contribution of member institutions to the DGF's securities guarantee compartment has been set at 2 per thousand of the calculation basis, made up of 5% of the amount of guaranteed securities, as indicated in section 2.b) of the aforementioned article 3 of Royal Decree 2606/1996, existing at 31 December 2023.\n\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>General information\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Management Committee of the DGF had communicated the annual contribution to be made by the Bank to the Deposit Guarantee Compartment for an amount of €1,512 million (€1,243 million at 31 December 2022). The portion corresponding to the Securities Guarantee Compartment has been provisioned for €850,000 (€650,000 provisioned at 31 December 2022), recorded under \"Other operating expenses\" in the accompanying consolidated income statement. (See Note 22.c).\n\n**e)Annual contribution to the Single Resolution Fund -** The National Resolution Fund (NRF, administered by the FROB) was created in 2015 and will be financed by annual contributions from credit institutions and investment firms until it reaches at least 1% of the amount of guaranteed deposits of all institutions by 31 December 2024. This fund has been mutualised with the other euro zone member countries' funds in the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) in January 2016.\n\nOn 7 November 2015, Royal Decree 1012/2015, of 6 November, implementing Law 11/2015, of 18 June, on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment services companies, and amending Royal Decree 2606/1996, of 20 December, on deposit guarantee funds for credit institutions, was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE).\n\nIn relation to the first of the aspects developed, the Royal Decree establishes that the FROB will determine the annual contributions of institutions to the NRF annually, adjusting these contributions to the Group's risk profile.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, Regulation 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2014 entered into force, by virtue of which the Single Resolution Board replaces the National Resolution Authorities, assuming competence over the administration of the SRF as well as the calculation of the contributions to be made by the institutions, applying the calculation methodology specified in Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/63 of 21 October 2014, in accordance with the uniform conditions of application explained in Council Implementing Regulation 2015/81 of 19 December 2014.\n\nDuring the year, the Group made a contribution to the SRF in the amount of €625,000 together with the associated fees of €18,000 (€512,000 and €1,000 respectively as at 31 December 2022). These amounts have been recorded under \"Other operating expenses\" in the accompanying consolidated profit and loss statement. (See Note 22.c).\n\nSince 29 September 2007, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. has had all of its shares accepted to trading on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges. They are also included in the Spanish Stock Exchange Interconnection System.\n\n#### **Corporate transactions**\n\nOn 26 September 2019, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. reached a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. which had been operating under the trade name \"BNP Paribas Personal Investors\".\n\nThe implementation of the acquisition was approved by the Ministry of Economy on 10 March 2020.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.1 Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts (hereinafter \"Annual Accounts\") of the Group for the financial year 2023 have been prepared by the Directors of the Parent Company, at the meeting of its Board of Directors held on 26 February 2024. These consolidated financial statements are expected to be approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders without any changes. The consolidated annual accounts for 2022 of Renta 4, Banco S.A. and subsidiaries were prepared by its Directors on 21 February 2023 and approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on 30 March 2023.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002, all companies governed by the law of a Member State of the European Union whose securities are listed on a regulated market of a Member State of the European Union must present their consolidated annual accounts for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2005 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (\"EU-IFRS\").\n\nIn this regard, the Group's consolidated annual accounts for 2023 are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union and taking into consideration the provisions of Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017 and its subsequent amendments, which constitute the development and adaptation to the Spanish credit institution sector of the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union and the other provisions of the regulatory framework for financial reporting that are applicable and with the format and marking requirements established in the European Commission's Delegated Regulation EU 2019/815. There are no mandatory accounting principles or measurement bases with a material effect on these consolidated financial statements that are no longer applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements for 2023 have been prepared taking into account all the mandatory accounting policies and rules and measurement bases that have a material effect on them, so that they fairly present the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and the consolidated results of its operations and consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.\n\nNote 4 summarises the significant accounting policies and measurement bases applied in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements for 2023. Note 2.9 below provides a summary of the main accounting regulatory changes in 2023.\n\nThe figures in these consolidated annual accounts are presented in thousands of euro, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## **2.2 Comparison of information**\n\nIn accordance with commercial legislation, the directors of the Parent Company present, for comparative purposes, in addition to the figures for 2023, for each item in the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated notes to the consolidated financial statements, the figures corresponding to the previous year.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, certain amounts of the comparative figures of some breakdowns for the 2022 financial year have been reclassified with the main purpose of reflecting certain breakout balances in a manner comparable to the balances of the current financial year. This aspect does not affect any summary of the comparative financial statements for the financial year 2022.\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been prepared considering the adaptation of the content of the public financial information to the preparation criteria, terminology, definitions and formats of the statements known as FINREP which are established on a mandatory basis for the consolidated financial information prepared applying the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/214 of 16 April, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n# **2.3 Use of judgements and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts**\n\nThe information included in the consolidated annual accounts is the responsibility of the Parent Company's directors.\n\nIn preparing certain disclosures in these financial statements, the directors have made judgements and estimates based on assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income,\n\nexpenses and commitments. The most significant estimates used in the preparation of these annual accounts relate to:\n\n- · Impairment losses on financial assets (see Note 4.h).\n- · Impairment losses and the useful life of tangible assets (see Note 4.j).\n- · Impairment tests of goodwill on consolidation (see Note 4.i).\n\nThe valuation of goodwill requires estimates to be made in order to determine its fair value for the purpose of assessing possible impairment. To determine this fair value, the Parent Company's directors estimate the expected future cash flows of the cash-generating unit of which it is a part and use an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on meeting budgets for the next five years, while discount rates depend on the interest rate and risk premium associated with each cash-generating unit. Note 4.i) and 14.a) discusses the assumptions used to calculate the value in use of cash-generating units and includes an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions.\n\n· The valuation of equity instruments in share delivery plans for executives and employees (see Note 4.p).\n\n- · The fair value of certain financial assets not listed on official secondary markets (see Note 6).\n- · Measurement of the financial risks to which the Group is exposed in the course of its business (see Note 5).\n\nThe estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors that have been judged to be the most reasonable at the present time and are reviewed periodically. If, as a result of such revisions or future events, there is a change in these estimates, the effect is recognised in the consolidated income statement for that period and subsequent periods in accordance with IAS 8.\n\n# <span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>Basis of presentation\n\n# **Macroeconomic, financial and geopolitical environment**\n\nThe macroeconomic environment during 2023 has been marked, mainly, by increases in interest rates by central banks and the progressive shift of their impact on economic and financial activity. In addition, during the 2023 financial year inflation has undergone a gradual moderation since the peaks produced in the 2022 financial year.\n\nDuring recent financial years there has been a gradual return to \"normality\" in relation to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020.\n\nIn addition, the restrictive measures imposed by the EU on Russia in the wake of the Ukrainian war continue during 2023. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base by depriving it of vital technologies and markets, and significantly limiting its ability to wage war. The entity continues to strengthen internal protocols to prohibit the making available of funds or economic resources for the benefit of natural or legal persons, entities or bodies included in the EU sanctions list.\n\nFinally, geopolitical factors such as armed conflict in the Middle East, and internal political developments generate uncertainty in the economy's evolution.\n\n# **2.4 Shares in the capital of credit institutions**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group did not hold any equity interests in other domestic or foreign credit institutions.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.7 Valuation homogenisation**\n\nThe necessary valuation adjustments have been made in order to adapt the valuation criteria of the subsidiaries to those of the Parent Company.\n\n#### **2.8 Elimination of internal operations**\n\nThe various reciprocal balances for internal transactions of loans, dividends, sale and purchase of goods and services have been eliminated.\n\n#### **2.9 Regulatory developments**\n\nThe accounting principles and policies and measurement methods applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not differ significantly from those described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023.\n\nIn the financial year 2023 the following standards have come into force and have been adopted by the European Union, which have been applied by the Group for the first time:\n\n# **Rules and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter, IASB) which have entered into force in the financial year 2023**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year the following rules and interpretations adopted by the European Union, together with the respective amendments, have entered into force without significantly impacting on the Group:\n\n#### **IFRS 17 \"Insurance contracts\"**\n\nIFRS 17 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of the insurance contracts. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that entities provide relevant and reliable information about such contracts.\n\nAccording to this standard, insurance contracts combine features of financial instruments and service contracts. In addition, many insurance\n\ncontracts generate cash flows that vary substantially and have a long duration. In order to provide useful information on these issues, IFRS 17:\n\n· ombines the present measurement of future cash flows with the recognition of revenue over the period in which the contracted services are performed.\n\n· presents the results for services rendered separately from the financial expenses and income from these contracts.\n\n· requires entities to decide whether to recognise all of their financial income and expenses from insurance contracts in the profit and loss account or whether to recognise part of these results in equity.\n\nAlso, in 2020, certain amendments were made to IFRS 17 to reduce implementation costs, simplifying the requirements of this standard and facilitating the explanations to be provided in relation to the results of the operations of the entities and the transition to this new standard, deferring its effective date to 1 January 2023 and reducing the requirements for firsttime application.\n\n## **Amendment to IFRS 17 \"First-time application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9: Comparative Information\"**\n\nThis limited amendment is intended to provide insurance entities with an option for the presentation of comparative information on financial assets in order to avoid accounting mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities in this comparative information when IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 are applied for the first time.\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Paper 2 \"Disclosure of Accounting Policies\"**\n\nThese amendments are intended to help institutions improve their disclosures in relation to their accounting policies by providing more useful information in their annual accounts.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 require entities to disclose material information in relation to their accounting\n\npolicies, rather than their significant accounting policies, clarifying that accounting information relating to immaterial transactions, events or situations need not be disclosed. The amendments to Practice Paper 2 on making judgements about materiality provide guidance on how the concept of materiality should be applied to accounting policy disclosures.\n\n# **Amendments to IAS 8 \"Definition of Accounting Estimates\"**\n\nThese amendments incorporate the definition of \"accounting estimates\" as the amounts in the financial statements whose measurement is subject to uncertainty which provides guidance on how to distinguish between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies. This distinction is relevant because changes in accounting estimates are recorded prospectively whereas changes in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively. In particular, it is clarified that changes in accounting estimates as a result of new information or developments are not treated as corrections of prior period errors.\n\n# **Amendments to IAS 12 \"Deferred Taxation Relating to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\"**\n\nCommission REGULATION (EU) 2022/1392 of 11 August 2022 amending Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 as regards IAS 12. Clarifications on exceptions to the initial recognition of assets or liabilities are not applicable where there are temporary taxable and deductible differences of the same amount.\n\n# **Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are no longer in effect**\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the most significant standards and interpretations that have been issued by the IASB but not applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, either because their effective date is subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements or because they have not yet been adopted by the European Union, are as follows:\n\n#### **2.5 Consolidation methods**\n\nThe Group classifies its investments in subsidiaries or associates according to the following criteria:\n\n· Subsidiaries are defined as entities over which the Group has control. An entity controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nTo be considered dependent, the following must be true:\n\n- **a.Poder: Power:** An investor has power over an investee when the investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. activities that significantly affect the investee's returns;\n- **b.Yields:** An investor is exposed, or entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with an investee when the returns to the investor from that involvement may vary depending on the economic performance of the investee. The investor's returns can be positive only, negative only or both positive and negative.\n- **c. Relationship between power and yield:** An investor controls an investee if the investor not only has power over the investee and is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, but also has the ability to use its power to affect the returns it earns from its involvement with the investee.\n\nSubsidiaries have been fully consolidated by the full consolidation method, which consists of the inclusion in the Group's balance sheet of all the rights and obligations comprising the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries, and in the income statement of all the income and expenses which contribute to the determination of their profit or loss for the year.\n\nLikewise, consolidation ceases when the Group loses control. When this situation arises, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the part of the year during which the Group retained control over them.\n\n· Associates are companies over which the Group has the capacity to exercise significant influence, based on the presence in their governing bodies, on the effective capacity to influence their strategic and operating policies and the existence of significant transactions. Associated entities have been consolidated using the equity method (also known as the \"equity consolidation method\"), whereby the book value of the investment is replaced by the amount corresponding to the percentage of the associated entity's equity.\n\n#### **2.6 Minority interests**\n\nThe value of the minority interests in the equity and results of consolidated subsidiaries is presented under \"Minority interests\" in the consolidated balance sheets and \"Profit for the year - Attributable to minority interests\" in the consolidated profit and loss statements and the consolidated statements of recognised income and expense, respectively.\n\nOn acquisitions of interests from external partners, the difference between the price paid and the amount recorded is recorded in equity attributable to the Parent Company.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Approved for EU application:**\n\n## **Amendments to IFRS 16 \"Lease liabilities on sale and leaseback transactions\"**\n\nComes into force from 1 January 2024 by Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/2579 of 20 November 2023 amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1803 as regards IFRS 16.\n\nThe application of the amendments to IFRS 16 shall be retrospective and early application is permitted.\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\"**\n\nComes into force from 1 January 2024, retroactively.\n\n#### **Not approved for EU application**\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 \"Supplier Financing Agreements\"**\n\nEarly implementation of these amendments is permitted. If they are applied to a period prior to the date of mandatory application, this should be broken down.\n\n#### **Amendments to IAS 21 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\"**\n\nEarly implementation of these amendments is permitted. If they are applied to a period prior to the date of mandatory application, this should be broken down\n\nThe group has assessed the impacts of these standards and has decided, where possible, not to exercise early application. It is also estimated that the adoption of the non-current amendments issued by the IASB will not have a significant impact on the Group.\n\n#### **2.10 Distribution of profits**\n\nThe distribution of profit for 2023 and 2022 is made in accordance with the proposed distribution of profit included in the annual accounts of the respective Group companies prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the countries in which they are located.\n\nThe proposed distribution of the Parent Company's profit for 2023 (determined in accordance with accounting principles and criteria generally accepted in Spain), formulated by the Directors and pending approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting, is as follows, as well as the distribution of the Parent Company's profit approved for 2022:\n\n|                                                | Thousands of Euro |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|\n|                                                | 2023              | 2022   |\n| Reserves                                       | 8,658             | 10,039 |\n| Interim dividend (Note 18.g)                   | 12,208            | 10,155 |\n| To complementary interim dividends (Note 18.g) | 4,883             | 2,031  |\n| Total distributed                              | 25,749            | 22,225 |\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe subsidiaries and associates of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. on 31 December 2023 and 2022 are listed in Annex I.

For these purposes, the presentation in accordance with EU-IFRS in these consolidated financial statements of financial assets subject to impairment or depreciation adjustments, net of these items, is not considered to be a \"compensation of balances\".\n\n## **d) Foreign currency transactions**\n\nFor the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, the functional and presentation currency is the euro, and so \"foreign currency\" is considered to be any currency other than the euro.\n\nOn initial recognition, foreign currency receivables and payables have been translated into euro using the spot exchange rate. After that time, the following rules apply for the conversion of balances denominated in foreign currencies into euro:\n\n· Monetary assets and liabilities have been translated into euro using the average official spot exchange rates published by the European Central Bank at the end of each year.\n\n· Income and expenses have been translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of foreign currency balances are recorded in the consolidated profit and loss account.\n\nAt year-end 2023, the total amount of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies amounted to €112.419 million and €98.302 million, respectively. At year-end 2022, the total amount of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies amounted to €112.882 million and €136.948 million, respectively.\n\n#### **e) Revenue recognition**\n\nAs a general rule, revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, less any trade discounts, rebates or discounts. When the cash inflow is deferred in time, fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows.\n\nThe recognition of any income in the consolidated income statement or in consolidated equity is subject to the following conditions:\n\n- · Their amount can be reliably estimated.\n- · It is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity.\n- · The information is verifiable.\n\nWhen doubt arises regarding the collectability of an amount previously recognised in income, the amount that is no longer likely to be collectible is recognised as an expense rather than as a reduction in income.\n\n#### **Interest, dividends and similar income and expense**\n\nInterest income, interest expense and similar items are generally recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.\n\nInterest shall be recognised in the profit and loss account on the basis of the following criteria, irrespective of the portfolio in which the assets are classified:\n\n- · Interest due before the date of initial recognition and receivable shall form part of the carrying amount of the debt instrument.\n- · Interest accrued after initial recognition of a debt instrument shall be incorporated, until collected, in the gross carrying amount of the instrument.\n\nDividends received from companies other than those included in the Group's scope of consolidation are recognised as income when the consolidated entities' right to receive them arises.\n\nWhen a debt instrument is considered impaired, interest income is recorded by applying to the carrying amount of the asset the interest rate used to discount the cash flows expected to be recovered.\n\n#### **Commissions, fees and similar items**\n\nFee and commission income and expenses that are not to be included in the calculation of the effective interest rate of transactions and/or are not included in the acquisition cost of financial assets or liabilities other than those classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to their nature.\n\nThe most significant of these are:\n\n· Those linked to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognised in the income statement upon collection/payment.\n\n· Those arising from transactions or services that continue over time, which are accounted for in the consolidated income statement over the life of such transactions or services.\n\n· Those relating to a single act, which are taken to the income statement when the act giving rise to them occurs.\n\n#### **Non-financial income and expenses**\n\nThey are recognised on an accruals basis.\n\n#### *Collections and payments deferred over time*\n\nThey are recognised for accounting purposes at the amount resulting from discounting the expected cash flows at market rates.\n\n## **f) Recognition, measurement and classification of financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and, simultaneously, a financial liability or equity instrument in another entity.\n\nFinancial instruments are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contract in accordance with the contract specifications. The Group recognises debt instruments, such as loans and cash deposits, from the date on which the legal right to receive, or the legal obligation to pay, cash arises and financial derivatives from the trade date. In addition, transactions in the foreign exchange market are recorded on the settlement date, and financial assets traded on the Spanish secondary securities markets are recognised on the trade date in the case of equity instruments and on the settlement date in the case of debt securities.\n\n## **f.1 Financial assets**\n\n#### *Classification of financial assets*\n\nIFRS 9 contains three main classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n# <span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>Accounting Principles and Assessment Criteria Applied\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *\"Financial assets held for trading\" and \"Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\":*\n\n\"Financial assets held for trading\" shall include financial assets whose business model is to generate profits by making purchases and sales or to generate profits in the short term. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss shall be classified under \"Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\" whenever the entity's business model for managing them or the characteristics of their contractual cash flows make it inappropriate to classify them in any of the other portfolios described above.\n\nThe assets recognised under these headings in the consolidated balance sheets are measured after acquisition at fair value and changes in their value (gains or losses) are recognised net under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net\" and \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement, except for interest on derivatives designated as economic and accounting interest rate hedges, which are recognised under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" in the consolidated income statement, net\" in the consolidated income statement, except for interest relating to derivatives designated as economic and accounting hedges on interest rates, which is recorded under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a), depending on where the results of the hedged instrument are recorded. However, changes arising from exchange differences are recorded under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.a).\n\n#### *\"Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\"*\n\n#### · **Debt financial instruments:**\n\nAssets recorded under this balance sheet heading are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in this valuation (gains or losses) are recognised temporarily, at their amount (net of the related tax effect), under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\"\n\nin the balance sheet. The amounts recorded under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" and \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Foreign currency translation\" continue to form part of the Bank's equity until the asset in which they arise is cancelled or until it is determined that the financial instrument is impaired. If these assets are sold, the amounts are written off with a balancing entry under \"Gains or losses on cancellation of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss, net\" or \"Exchange differences, net\", as appropriate, in the income statement for the period in which the cancellation occurs. In addition, net impairment losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income arising in the year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" in the income statement for the year (see Note 22.f). Currency differences arising from monetary items are recorded under \"Currency differences, net\" in the income statement (see Note 22.g).\n\nIn addition, net impairment losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in the year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss and net gains or losses on modification - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" in the consolidated income statement for the year (see Note 22.f).\n\nExchange differences arising from monetary items are recorded under \"Exchange differences, net\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.g).\n\n#### · **Equity financial instruments:**\n\nOn initial recognition of specific investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. Subsequent changes in this valuation shall be recognised in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items not to be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\".\n\n#### *\"Financial assets at amortised cost\"*\n\nA financial instrument shall be classified in the amortised cost portfolio when it is managed under a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets to receive contractual cash flows, and it meets the PIO test.\n\nAssets recognised under this heading in the consolidated balance sheets are measured subsequent to acquisition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\nNet impairment losses on assets recognised in these captions occurring in each year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - Financial assets at amortised cost\" in the consolidated income statement for that period (see Note 22.f).\n\nImpairment losses on financial instruments are recognised in accordance with Note 4.h).\n\n#### **f.2) Financial liabilities**\n\n#### **Classification of financial liabilities**\n\nUnder IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified into the following categories:\n\n· Financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n· Financial liabilities held for trading (including derivatives): these are instruments that are recorded in this category when the Group's objective is to generate profits through purchases and sales of these instruments;\n\n· Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition (fair value option). The Group has the option to irrevocably designate a financial liability as measured at fair value through profit or loss if the application of\n\nThe classification of financial instruments into an amortised cost or fair value category has to pass two tests: the business model and the contractual cash flow assessment, commonly referred to as the \"principal and interest only approach\" (hereinafter PIO).\n\nA financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n· The financial asset is held under a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to earn contractual cash flows; and\n\n· The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, essentially understood as compensation for the time value of money and the debtor's credit risk.\n\nA financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n· The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by earning contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n\n· The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, at specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nA debt financial instrument shall be classified at fair value through profit or loss whenever the entity's business model for managing it or the characteristics of its contractual cash flows make it inappropriate to classify it in any of the other portfolios described.\n\nIn general, equity financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, the Group may irrevocably elect, at the time of initial recognition, to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial assets will only be reclassified when the Group decides to change the business model. In this case, all financial assets of that business model shall be reclassified. The change in business model objective must be prior to the reclassification date.\n\n#### **Valuation of financial assets**\n\nAll financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of financial instruments that are not classified at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the instruments.\n\nExcept for trading derivatives that are not economic and accounting hedges, all changes in the value of financial assets arising from the accrual of interest and similar items are recognised under \"Interest income\" in the consolidated income statement for the period in which the accrual occurs (see Note 22.a). Dividends received from companies other than subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are recognised under \"Dividend income\" in the consolidated income statement for the period in which the right to receive them arises.\n\nChanges in valuations occurring after initial recognition for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated as described below, depending on the categories in which the financial assets are classified.\n\nIts financial assets are classified into the following portfolios for valuation purposes:\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nthis criterion eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies, or if it is a group of financial liabilities, or a group of financial assets and financial liabilities, that is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in line with a risk management or investment strategy.\n\n#### **Valuation of financial liabilities**\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of financial instruments that are not classified at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the instruments.\n\nChanges in valuations occurring after initial recognition for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated as described below, depending on the categories in which the financial liabilities are classified:\n\n## *\"Financial liabilities held for trading\" and \"Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\"*\n\nThe liabilities recognised under these headings in the consolidated balance sheets are measured after recognition at fair value and changes in their value (gains or losses) are recognised, at their net amount, under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net\" and \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement (see \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement) Note 22.f), except for interest on derivatives designated as economic and accounting hedges on interest rates, which is recorded under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a), depending on where the results of the hedged instrument are recorded. However, changes arising from exchange differences are recorded under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.a).\n\n#### *\"Financial liabilities at amortised cost\"*\n\nThe liabilities under this heading in the consolidated balance sheets are measured subsequent to acquisition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\n#### **f.3) Gains and losses on financial instruments**\n\nGains and losses on financial instruments are recorded depending on the portfolio in which they are classified according to the following criteria:\n\n· For financial instruments included in the \"Held for trading\" category, changes in fair value are recognised directly in the profit and loss account.\n\n· For financial instruments measured at amortised cost, changes in their fair value are recognised when the financial instrument is cancelled and, in the case of financial assets, when they become impaired.\n\n· For financial instruments included in the category \"Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income\", changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, as \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive\n\nincome\", until cancellation, when the existing amount is transferred to the income statement. Impairment losses, if any, are recognised in the profit and loss account, and as \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items not to be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\".\n\n#### **f.4) Fair value and amortised cost of financial instruments**\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument on a specified date is the amount for which it could be bought or sold on that date between two knowledgeable, willing parties in a mutually independent transaction. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it in an organised, transparent and deep market (\"quoted price\" or \"market price\").\n\nWhen a market publishes bid and demand prices for the same instrument, the market price for an asset to be acquired or a liability to be issued is the bid price (demand), while the price for an asset to be acquired or a liability to be issued is the ask price (bid). In case there is relevant market making activity or it can be demonstrated that positions can be closed out liquidated or hedged - at the mid-price, then the midprice is used. When there is no market price for a given financial instrument, its fair value is estimated on the basis of the price established in recent transactions involving similar instruments or, failing that, on the basis of valuation models sufficiently tested by the financial community, taking into account the specific characteristics of the instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with the instrument.\n\nValuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument meet the following requirements:\n\n· The most consistent and appropriate financial and economic methods are used, which have been shown to provide the most realistic estimate of the price of the financial instrument.\n\n· These are those commonly used by market participants when valuing that type of financial instrument, such as discounted cash flow,\n\ncondition-based option pricing models, nonarbitrage, etc.\n\n· They maximise the use of available information, both in terms of observable data and recent transactions with similar characteristics, and limit the use of unobservable data and estimates as much as possible.\n\n· They are comprehensively and sufficiently documented, including the reasons for their choice over other possible alternatives.\n\n· The chosen valuation methods are respected over time, as long as there are no reasons that change the reasons for their choice.\n\n· The validity of valuation models is regularly assessed using recent transactions and current market data.\n\nThey take into account the following factors: time value of money, credit risk, exchange rate, commodity price, price of equity instruments, volatility, market liquidity, risk of early termination and administration costs.\n\nSpecifically, the fair value of financial derivatives traded on organised, transparent and deep markets included in the trading portfolios is assimilated to their daily quotation and if, for exceptional reasons, their quotation cannot be established on a given date, they are valued using methods similar to those used to value derivatives not traded on organised markets.\n\nThe fair value of OTC derivatives or derivatives traded on shallow or transparent organised markets is taken to be the sum of the future cash flows arising from the instrument, discounted to present value at the date of valuation (\"present value\" or \"theoretical close\"), using methods recognised by the financial markets in the valuation process: \"net present value (NPV)\", option pricing models, etc.\n\nAmortised cost means the acquisition cost of a financial asset or liability plus or minus, as appropriate, principal and interest repayments and plus or minus, as appropriate, the portion taken to the consolidated profit and loss account, using the effective interest method, of the difference between the initial amount and the redemption value of such financial instruments. In the case of financial assets, the amortised cost also includes impairment losses.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the discount rate that exactly matches the initial value of a financial instrument to all of its estimated cash flows from all sources over its remaining life, without regard to future credit risk losses. For fixed-rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate coincides with the contractual interest rate established at the time of acquisition, adjusted, where applicable, for any fees and transaction costs that, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, must be included in the calculation of the effective interest rate. For floating rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate is estimated in a manner similar to that for fixed rate transactions and is recalculated at each contractual interest rate reset date on the basis of changes in the future cash flows of the transaction.\n\n#### **g) Reclassifications between portfolios**\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting on 21 February 2023 decided to formulate the Annual Accounts without effecting the reclassification agreed at the meeting on 28 June 2022 of a debt item in the nominal amount of €310 million from the category \"Financial assets at fair value through equity\" to the category \"Financial assets at amortised cost\".\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, the Group has not done any reclassifications between portfolios.\n\n#### **h) Impairment of financial assets**\n\nA financial asset is considered impaired - and, consequently, its carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the effect of its impairment - when there is objective evidence that events have occurred that give rise to:\n\n**1.** A negative effect on future cash flows that were estimated at the time the transaction was entered into, in the case of debt instruments (loans and debt securities).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.** In the case of equity instruments, their carrying amount cannot be recovered in full.\n\nAs a general rule, the carrying amount of impaired financial instruments is adjusted for impairment with a charge to the income statement for the year in which the impairment becomes evident. Reversals of previously recognised impairment losses, if any, are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is reversed or reduced.\n\nWhen the recovery of any amount recorded is considered remote, it is removed from the balance sheet, without prejudice to any action that the Bank may take to seek collection until its rights have been definitively extinguished, whether by lapse of time, forgiveness or other causes.\n\nThe criteria applied by the Group to determine possible impairment losses on each category of financial instruments and the method used to calculate the hedges recognised for impairment are set out below.\n\nThe \"expected loss\" impairment model is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments; and to financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments unilaterally revocable by the Group.\n\nSimilarly, all financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are excluded from the impairment model.\n\nThe standard classifies financial instruments into three categories, depending on the evolution of their credit risk since initial recognition. The first category comprises transactions when initially recognised (Stage 1), the second category comprises transactions for which a significant increase in credit risk has been identified since initial recognition (Stage 2) and the third category comprises impaired transactions (Stage 3)\n\n#### **Definition of impaired financial assets**\n\nThe \"expected loss\" impairment model is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments; and to financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments.\n\nIFRS 9 differentiates between the following expected loss concepts:\n\n- · 12-month expected loss: these are the expected credit losses resulting from possible events of default within 12 months after the reporting date; and\n- · Expected loss over the duration of the entire transaction: the expected credit losses resulting from all possible events of default during the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\nThe estimate of expected loss over the duration of the entire transaction is applied if the credit risk of a financial asset at the reporting date has increased significantly since initial recognition and the 12-month expected loss measurement is applied if it has not.\n\nThe Group considers the following definitions:\n\n#### **1. Non-compliance:**\n\nThe Group applies a definition of default for financial instruments that is consistent with that used in internal credit risk management, as well as with the indicators set out in the applicable banking regulations. Both qualitative and quantitative indicators are considered.\n\nThe Group considers a default to exist when one of the following situations occurs:\n\n- · a default of more than 90 days; or\n- · there is reasonable doubt about the full repayment of the instrument.\n\nThe 90-day default is a presumption that can be rebutted in cases where the entity believes, based on reasonable and documented information, that a longer period is appropriate. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has not used terms longer than 90 days for any of the significant portfolios.\n\nThis definition is consistently applied throughout the Group.\n\n#### **2. Impaired financial assets:**\n\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset. Observable data on the following events are evidence that a financial asset is impaired:\n\n- · significant financial difficulties of the issuer or the borrower.\n- · non-compliance with contractual clauses, such as non-payment or an event of default.\n- · concessions or advantages that the lender, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, has granted to the borrower that it would not otherwise have provided.\n- · increasing likelihood that the borrower will enter\n\n#### bankruptcy or other financial restructuring.\n\n- · the disappearance of an active market for the financial asset in question due to financial difficulties, or\n- · the purchase or creation of a financial asset at a deep discount reflecting the credit loss incurred.\n- It may not be possible to identify a single specific event, but rather the combined effect of several events may have caused the financial asset to become credit-impaired.\n\nThe Group's definition of an impaired financial asset is aligned with the definition of default described in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n#### **3. Significant increase in credit risk:**\n\nThe objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition considering all reasonable and documented information, including forward-looking information.\n\nThe model developed by the Group, which consists of the assessment of qualitative factors (triggers, refinancing, macroeconomic information, etc.) and, in some cases, quantitative factors for the assessment of significant increases in credit risk, has a two-pronged approach that is applied globally.\n\nIn any case, instruments are considered as Stage-2 (see below) if any of the following circumstances apply:\n\n- · Non-payment of more than 30 days that are subject to special surveillance by the Risk units because they show negative signals in their credit quality, although there is no objective evidence of impairment.\n- · Refinancing or restructuring that do not show evidence of impairment.\n\nThe standard introduces a number of operational simplifications/practical solutions for the analysis of significant risk enhancement for certain high credit quality assets. The Group uses this possibility provided by the standard to directly consider that their credit risk has not increased significantly because they have a low credit risk at the reporting date.\n\nTherefore, the classification of financial instruments subject to impairment under the new IFRS 9 will be as follows:\n\n· **Stage-1:** No significant increase in impairment: The allowance for losses on these financial instruments is calculated as the expected credit losses over the following twelve months.\n\n· **Stage-2:** Significant increase in impairment: When the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment loss on that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss over the duration of the asset.\n\n· **Stage-3:** Impaired: When there is objective evidence that the financial asset is impaired, it is transferred to this category in which the impairment loss on that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss over the life of the asset.\n\n#### **Methodology for calculating expected losses**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the estimate of expected losses should reflect:\n\n- · a weighted and unbiased amount determined by assessing a range of possible outcomes.\n- · the value of the money over time.\n\n· reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue effort or cost and that reflects both current conditions and predictions of future conditions.\n\nThe Group estimates expected losses both individually and collectively.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe objective of the Group's individual estimate is to estimate expected losses for significant impaired or Stage 2 risks. In these cases, the amount of credit losses is calculated as the difference between the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the transaction and the carrying amount of the instrument.\n\nFor the collective estimation of expected losses, instruments are grouped into asset pools based on their risk characteristics. Exposures within each group are segmented according to common credit risk characteristics, such as credit risk grade; geographic region; sector for corporates; default status; and product type for individuals. In the case of collective measurement, the Group estimates the cash flows it expects to receive as the sum of the marginal losses occurring in each period and over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\nIf the risk has increased significantly since origination, expected losses are measured over the remaining life of the instrument, otherwise expected losses are measured over the next 12 months.\n\nMarginal losses are derived from the following parameters:\n\n· **PD:** estimated probability of default in each period\n\n· **EAD:** estimated exposure at default in each future period, taking into account changes in exposure after the reporting date, including prepayments.\n\n· **LGD:** estimated loss in case of default, as the difference between the contractual cash flows and those expected to be received, including collateral.\n\nFor debt securities, the Group monitors changes in credit risk by monitoring published external credit ratings.\n\n#### **Use of present, past and future information**\n\nIFRS 9 requires the incorporation of present, past and future information for both the detection of the significant increase in risk and the measurement of expected losses.\n\nIn estimating expected losses, the standard does not require the identification of all possible scenarios. However, the probability of a loss event occurring and the probability of it not occurring must be considered, even if the chance of a loss occurring is very small. Also, where there is no linear relationship between different future economic scenarios and their associated expected losses, more than one future economic scenario should be used for estimation.\n\n#### **Hedge accounting**\n\nThe Group currently has no hedge accounting.\n\n#### **i) Goodwill and other intangible assets**\n\n#### **Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of business combinations over the fair value of their net assets acquired at the acquisition date.\n\nWhen the acquisition is made with deferred payment, the acquisition price corresponds to the present value of the deferred payment.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Any impairment arising is recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss account and may not be reversed in the future.\n\nFor the impairment calculation, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and its recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, it is considered to be impaired and the carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount. Goodwill impairment losses recognised are not reversed in subsequent years (Note 14).\n\nTo estimate value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the investment.\n\nIn the event of the disposal or sale of a subsidiary or associate, the goodwill attributed to that company, if any, is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n#### **Other intangible assets**\n\nThe Group recognised its computer software and the \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition in December 2006 of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. as \"Other intangible assets\", S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. In addition, the Group recorded the \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa and the acquisition of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. in 2020 (see Note 14).\n\nComputer software includes amounts paid for access to ownership or for the right to use software. The maintenance costs of these computer applications are charged directly as expenses in the year in which they are incurred.\n\nThey are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three years from the moment the use of the corresponding software application begins.\n\nThe \"Customer relationships\" acquired from the acquisition in December 2006 of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. were amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years (useful life), which is the period of time that management estimated that these relationships would be maintained based on the information available. As at 31 December 2014, these \"Customer relationships\" were fully amortised. The \"Customer Relations\" resulting from the acquisition in 2012 of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. were amortised on a straight-line basis\n\nover a period of 7 years (useful life), which is the length of time that management estimated these relationships would be maintained, based on available historical information. As at 31 December 2019, these customer relationships were fully amortised. In addition, \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition in 2020 of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. (see Note 1) are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 14 years (useful life), which is the length of time that management has calculated that these relationships will be maintained based on available information.\n\n## **j) Tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are classified according to their intended use as: tangible assets for own use, investment property and other assets leased out under operating leases.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment for own use are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any impairment losses. This heading covers assets, both owned and leased (right of use), which the Bank holds for current or future use and which it expects to use for more than one financial year. It also includes tangible assets received by the Bank in full or partial settlement of financial assets which represent receivables from third parties and which are expected to be used on an ongoing basis.\n\nFor further information on the accounting treatment of rights of use under leases, see Note 4.v.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditure incurred both initially on acquisition and production and subsequently on expansion, replacement or improvement when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow from their use.\n\nUpkeep and maintenance expenses, which do not increase the useful life of the asset, are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group considered the acquisition cost at the date of transition to EU-IFRS (1 January 2005) to be the carrying amount recorded under Spanish GAAP at 1 January 2005.\n\nInvestment property reflects the net book value of a building (including land) held for rental purposes.\n\nThe acquisition or production cost of tangible assets, net of their residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the years of estimated useful life of the various assets, as follows:\n\nMaterial assets are cancelled when they are disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected to arise from their disposal, sale or abandonment. The difference between the amount of the sale and its carrying amount is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss account in the period in which the asset is cancelled.\n\nThe Group periodically assesses whether there are indications, both internally and externally, that any tangible assets may be impaired at the reporting date. For those assets identified, it estimates the recoverable amount of the tangible asset as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount so determined is less than the carrying amount, the difference between the two is recognised in profit or loss and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.\n\n#### **k) Cash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits**\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and balances on demand with financial intermediaries.\n\n#### **l) Treasury shares and convertible shares**\n\nThe Parent Company shares held by the Group are accounted for as a reduction of consolidated equity.\n\nNo gain or loss is recognised in consolidated profit or loss for the year arising from treasury share transactions, which is recognised directly in consolidated equity. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised under \"Share premium\".\n\nConvertible shares are separated between the liability and equity component based on the terms of the contract. On the issue of convertible shares, the fair value of the liability component is determined using the market rate of an equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until extinguished through conversion or settlement. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in the net equity. Transaction costs are deducted from equity, net of the associated income tax. The carrying amount of the conversion option is not revalued in subsequent periods. Transaction costs of the convertible preference shares are allocated between the liability and equity components on the basis of the allocation made of the amount realised between the liability and equity components at initial recognition of the instrument.\n\n#### **m) Provisions**\n\nObligations existing at the consolidated balance sheet date arising from past events which could give rise to a loss for the Group, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as provisions at the present value of the most probable amount that the Group expects to have to pay to settle the obligation. Provisions are quantified on the basis of the best information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated annual accounts on the consequences of the event giving rise to them and are re-estimated at each balance sheet date.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022, the provisions reflected in the consolidated balance sheet mainly cover certain risks arising from the development of its activity and risks from claims by third parties of the Parent Company and other subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities recorded in a business combination**\n\nContingent liabilities recognised in a business combination are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the recognition criteria for provisions, noted above, or the amount initially recognised less, where applicable, accumulated amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\nThe allocation and release of provisions deemed necessary in accordance with the above criteria are recognised with a charge or credit, respectively, to \"Provisions (net)\" in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### **n) Income tax**\n\nThe income tax expense is determined by the tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year, after taking into account changes during the year arising from temporary differences, tax credits, tax relief and negative tax base.\n\nThe income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement except when the transaction is recognised directly in equity and in business combinations where the deferred tax is recognised as an equity item.\n\nIn order for tax credits, tax relief and negative tax bases to be effective, the requirements established in current legislation must be met, provided that their recovery is probable, either because there are sufficient deferred tax liabilities or because they have arisen due to specific situations that are considered unlikely to occur in the future.\n\nThe tax effect of temporary differences is included, where applicable, in the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities under \"Tax assets\" and \"Tax liabilities\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAt least at the end of each year, the Group reviews the deferred tax assets recognised and makes appropriate valuation adjustments if the deferred tax assets are no longer current or can be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the effective tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised or the liabilities are settled, based on tax rates (and tax legislation) enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **o) Commissions**\n\nThis heading includes brokerage, asset management, custody and other revenues related to the Group's activities (underwriting, placement, etc.). This revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement as the service is rendered or, in the case of a service that is performed in a single act, at the time the service is performed.\n\n## **p) Staff costs**\n\n#### **Short-term remuneration**\n\nThis type of remuneration is valued, without discounting, at the amount to be paid for the services received, and is generally recorded as personnel expenses for the year and as an accrual for the difference between the total expense and the amount already paid.\n\n#### **Other staff remuneration**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Bank has not granted loans to its employees for the acquisition of shares of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has granted personal loans to several of its employees to cover their personal and/or family needs as set out in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements amounting to €927,000 unsecured (€739,000 in 2022), in compliance with the conditions established therein, having granted such financing at zero interest rate.\n\n|                                   | Years of useful life | Depreciation<br>percentages used |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Buildings and other constructions | 50                   | 2 %                              |\n| Investment properties             |                      |                                  |\n| Building                          | 50                   | 2 %                              |\n| Facilities                        | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Machinery, plant and tools        | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Furniture and furnishings         | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Transport elements                | 6.25                 | 16 %                             |\n| Information processing equipment  | 4                    | 25 %                             |\n| Other fixed assets                | 5                    | 20 %                             |\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe difference between the present value of the payments to be made by the employee and the fair value is recorded in the consolidated profit and loss account as a personnel expense.\n\nThe amount recognised in the consolidated income statement for zero interest loans amounted to €44,000 of expense for 2023 (€7,000 of income for 2022) (see note 22.d).\n\n#### **Pension commitments**\n\nThe Group classifies its commitments according to their nature as either defined contribution, for which the Group is only required to make fixed contributions to a third party, or defined benefit, for which the Group undertakes to pay an amount when the contingency occurs based on variables such as age, years of service and salary.\n\nThe Group's commitments are as follows:\n\n#### *Renta 4, Sociedad de Valores, S.A.*\n\nIn accordance with the collective bargaining agreement in force at Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, in the case of employees from the former stockbrokers' offices, there is an obligation to pay a long-service bonus on reaching 25, 35 or 45 years of service. The Group has not made any provision for this item as it considers that the amount accrued at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is not significant.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement in force, must provide coverage for early retirement, death and disability for employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement for Securities Companies and Agencies of the Autonomous Community of Madrid. The Company is covering these commitments by setting up a defined benefit pension plan.\n\nIn addition, for the rest of the employees of this company who are not covered by this agreement, the Group has been covering the contingencies of retirement, incapacity, death, severe dependence or great dependence through a defined contribution plan with an annual contribution of €600 per employee since 2006.\n\n#### *Renta 4 Banco, S.A., Renta 4 Corporate, S.A., Renta 4 Gestora, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Renta 4 Pensiones, S.G.F.P., S.A.*\n\nSince 2007, the Group has been covering for the employees of these companies the contingencies of retirement, incapacity for work, death, severe dependency or severe dependency by setting up two defined contribution plans to which it contributes €600 per employee per year.\n\n#### **Defined contribution plans**\n\nThese plans are measured at the present value of the contributions to be made, unless they are payable\n\nearlier than twelve months after the date of the consolidated financial statements when the related employee services were received, in which case the amount is not discounted. The contribution accrued during the year in this connection is recorded under \"Staff costs\" in the consolidated income statement. The amount corresponding to the contributions recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement amounted to €340,000 and €385,000 for the years 2023 and 2022 (Note 22.d).\n\n#### *Defined benefit plan*\n\nThe Group calculates the present value of its defined benefit plan obligations at the date of the consolidated financial statements, after deducting unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of plan assets, as required by current regulations. The figure thus obtained is recorded as a provision for defined benefit pension funds.\n\nThe Group considers plan assets to be those that meet the following characteristics:\n\n- · They are owned by a legally separate third party that is not a related party.\n- · They are available exclusively to pay or finance commitments to employees.\n\n· They cannot be returned to the Group except when commitments to employees have been settled or to satisfy the Group for benefits provided.\n\n· They are not non-transferable instruments issued by the Group.\n\nThe net amount of current service cost, interest cost, the expected return on any plan assets, past service\n\ncost and the effect of any curtailment or settlement of the plan is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the period.\n\nPast service cost is recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated income statement, unless changes to the plan are conditional on the employee remaining with the Group for a specified period of time, in which case the expense is allocated on a straight-line basis over that period.\n\n\"Actuarial gains and losses\" are those arising from differences between previous actuarial assumptions and reality and from changes in the actuarial assumptions used, and are recognised in full in the consolidated income statement for the year in which they arise.\n\nThe Group has not incurred any costs in relation to its defined benefit obligations in 2023 and 2022 (Note 22.d).\n\nThe Renta 4 Group externalised all its pension commitments to its employees, in accordance with Royal Decree 1588/1999 of 15 October, by setting up pension plans and taking out insurance contracts with a company outside the Renta 4 Group.\n\nSpecifically, the defined benefit retirement obligations of Renta 4, S.A. Sociedad de Valores are covered by assets covered by the related insurance policy and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets at the net amount of the obligations assumed, less the related assets. During the financial year 2021, the defined benefit plan was terminated when the only covered person reached the age of 65. It was agreed with the employee to transfer the existing balance to a defined contribution plan. Since then there have been no defined benefit pension commitments.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe indirect method has been used to prepare the consolidated cash flow statement. This begins with profit or loss, adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions and all types of deferred payment items and accruals that are the cause of past or future operating cash receipts and payments, as well as income and expenses associated with cash flows from activities classified as investing or financing activities.\n\n#### **s) Related party transactions**\n\nRelated party transactions are accounted for in accordance with the valuation rules detailed above.\n\nThe prices of related party transactions are adequately supported and the Parent Company's Administrators consider that there are no risks that could give rise to significant tax liabilities.\n\n#### **t) Statement of changes in net equity**\n\nThe statement of changes in equity presented in these consolidated annual accounts shows the total changes in equity during the year. This information is further broken down into two statements: the statement of recognised income and expense and the statement of total changes in equity. The main features of the information contained in both parts of the statement are explained below:\n\n#### *Consolidated statement of recognised income and expenditure*\n\nThis part of the statement of changes in consolidated net equity presents the income and expenses generated by the Group as a result of its activity during the year, distinguishing between those recognised as profit or loss in the profit and loss account for the year and other income and expenses recognised, in accordance with current legislation, directly in equity.\n\nTherefore, this statement presents:\n\n- · The result of the period.\n- · The net amount of income and expenses recognised temporarily as \"accumulated other comprehensive income\" as valued in the net equity.\n- · The net amount of income and expenses recognised definitively in equity.\n- · The tax on profits accrued for the items indicated in the two preceding paragraphs.\n- · Total recognised income and expenses, calculated as the sum of the above letters.\n\nChanges in income and expenses recognised in equity as \"Other comprehensive income\" are broken down as follows:\n\n#### *Severance payments*\n\nTermination benefits are recognised as a provision and as a personnel expense only when the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date or paying termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\n#### **q) Off-balance sheet customer funds**\n\nThe Group records funds entrusted by third parties for investment in investment companies and funds, pension funds, insurance-savings contracts and discretionary portfolio management in memorandum accounts (off-balance sheet) at their fair value (see Note 23).\n\nIn addition, off-balance sheet items (see Note 19) include assets acquired on behalf of third parties, equity instruments, debt instruments, derivatives and other financial instruments held on deposit for which the Group has a liability to its customers at fair value or, if there is no reliable estimate of fair value, at cost. On occasions, and in accordance with the contracts signed with customers and only when market operations so require (international markets), the Group uses global custody accounts (omnibus), in which the Group appears as the holder of the positions, keeping the necessary internal records to know the breakdown by customer.\n\nTo determine the fair value of these positions, the Group uses the quoted values obtained from the various markets or those provided by the global custodians in the case of units in investment funds (net asset value).\n\n#### **r) Consolidated cash flow statement**\n\n- In the consolidated cash flow statement, the following expressions are used in the following senses:\n- · Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid investments with low risk of changes in value.\n- · Operating activities: typical activities of credit institutions, as well as other activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing activities.\n- · Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n- · Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and liabilities, which are not part of operating activities.\n\n· Valuation gains (losses): includes the amount of income, net of expenses incurred during the year, recognised directly in equity. Amounts recognised in the period in this item are retained in this item, even if in the same period they are transferred to the profit and loss account, to the initial value of other assets or liabilities or reclassified to another item.\n\n· Amounts transferred to the profit and loss account: includes the amount of valuation gains or losses previously recognised in equity, albeit in the same period, which are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n· Amount transferred to the initial value of hedged items: includes the amount of valuation gains or losses previously recognised in equity, albeit in the same period, that are recognised in the initial value of assets or liabilities as a result of cash flow hedges.\n\n· Other reclassifications: includes the amount of the transfers made during the year between valuation adjustment items in accordance with the criteria established in current regulations.\n\nAll items in the statement of recognised income and expense are eligible for recognition in the profit and loss account, except the item \"Actuarial gains (losses) on pension plans\". The amounts of these items are presented gross, with the corresponding tax effect shown under \"Income tax\" in the statement.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Consolidated statement of changes in total net equity*\n\nThis part of the statement of changes in equity presents all changes in equity, including those arising from changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors. This statement therefore shows a reconciliation of the carrying amounts at the beginning and at the end of the year of all the items that make up equity, grouping the movements according to their nature into the following items:\n\n· Effect of changes in accounting policies and correction of errors: which includes changes in equity arising from the retrospective restatement of financial statement balances arising from changes in accounting policies or corrections of errors.\n\n· Total comprehensive income for the period: includes, on an aggregate basis, the total of the items recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses indicated above.\n\nOther changes in equity: includes all other items recognised in equity, such as increases or decreases in the endowment fund, distribution of profit or loss, transactions in own equity instruments, payments in equity instruments, transfers between equity items and any other increases or decreases in equity.\n\n#### **u) Financial guarantees**\n\nFinancial guarantees are contracts whereby the Group undertakes to pay specific amounts for a third party in the event of the latter's failure to do so. The main contracts included under this heading, which are included in the \"Pro memoria\" information at the end of the consolidated balance sheet, are financial guarantees.\n\nWhen the Group issues such contracts, they are recognised under \"Financial liabilities at amortised cost - Other financial liabilities\" on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value and simultaneously under \"Other financial assets\" in \"Loans and receivables\" at the present value of the future cash flows to be received using, for both items, a discount rate similar to that of financial assets granted by the Entity to the counterparty with similar maturity and risk. Subsequent to issuance, such contracts are valued by recording the differences against the profit and loss account as finance income or as commission received, depending on whether they are recorded under \"Other financial assets\" or \"Other financial liabilities\", respectively. In addition to the above, financial guarantees will be hedged as set out in Note 5.a.2 relation to credit risk hedging.\n\n#### **v) Leases**\n\nOn 1 January 2019, IFRS 16 became effective, replacing IAS 17 \"Leases\". The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model, which requires the recognition of assets and liabilities for all lease contracts. The standard provides two exceptions to the recognition of lease assets and liabilities, which can be applied in the case of short-term contracts and those where the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nThe Bank has decided to apply both exemptions. The lessee must recognise in assets a right of use representing its right to use the leased asset which is recorded under ''Tangible assets - Property, plant and equipment'' in the balance sheet (see Note 13), and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments which is recorded under ''Financial liabilities at amortised cost - Other financial liabilities'' in the balance sheet (see Note 16).\n\nOn the commencement date of the lease, the lease liability represents the present value of all outstanding lease payments. Liabilities recognised in this balance sheet caption are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\nRights of use are initially recorded at cost. This cost includes the initial valuation of the lease liability, any payments that are made prior to the commencement date less lease incentives received, all initial direct expenses incurred, as well as an estimate of expenses to be incurred by the lessee such as expenses related to the removal and dismantling\n\nof the underlying asset. Assets recorded under this item in the balance sheets are measured after initial recognition at cost less cost:\n\n· Accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment; and\n\n· Any revaluation of the related lease liability.\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities is recognised in the income statement under \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a). Variable payments not included in the initial valuation of the lease liability are recorded under \"Administrative expenses - Other administrative expenses\" (see Note 22.d).\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the acquisition cost of the assets over the life of the lease contract. Depreciation of tangible assets is recorded under \"Depreciation and amortisation\" in the income statement (see Note 13).\n\nIn the event that one of the two exceptions is chosen in order not to recognise the right of use and the related liability in the balance sheet, the related lease payments are recognised in the profit and loss account, over the lease term or on a straight-line basis or in another manner that best represents the structure of the lease transaction, under \"Administrative expenses - Other administrative expenses\" (see Note 22.e).\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nActivity in financial instruments may involve the assumption or transfer of one or more types of risk by the Group. The risks related to financial instruments are:\n\n· Credit risk. The risk that one party to the financial instrument contract will fail to meet its contractual obligations because of the insolvency or incapacity of the natural or legal persons and will cause the other party to incur a financial loss.\n\n· Liquidity risk, sometimes referred to as funding risk, is the risk that arises either from an entity's inability to sell a financial asset quickly for an amount close to its fair value or from an entity's difficulty in finding funds to meet its commitments related to financial instruments.\n\n· Market risk: These are risks arising from holding financial instruments whose value may be affected by changes in market conditions; they include three types of risk:\n\n**(i)** Foreign exchange risk: It arises as a consequence of changes in the exchange rate between currencies.\n\n**(ii)** Interest rate risk: It arises as a consequence of changes in market interest rates.\n\n**(iii)** Price risk: It arises as a result of changes in market prices, either because of factors specific to the instrument itself or because of factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group holds positions in equity instruments which, although they expose it to this type of risk, do not do so to a significant extent.\n\nThe Group has implemented a risk management model based on the following pillars:\n\n#### **a) Credit risk**\n\n#### **a.1 Credit risk management and measurement**\n\nCredit risk arises from the potential loss caused by the failure of the Group's counterparties to meet their contractual obligations. In the case of repayable financing granted to third parties, this occurs as a result of the non-recovery of principal, interest and other items in the terms of the amount, term and other conditions established in the contracts. Offbalance sheet risks arise from the counterparty's failure to meet its obligations to third parties, which requires the Group to assume them as its own by virtue of the commitment it has entered into.\n\nThe Group takes on credit risk exposure when counterparties fail to meet their commitments. In this respect, it distinguishes between two types of counterparties: customers in general and financial institutions and public administrations. The current customer credit risk control system is based on the development of new systems for the evaluation and classification of individual and group debtors, from\n\nwhich provisions are determined to cover possible losses.\n\nAs regards the granting, monitoring and control of risk with customers in general, the Group's Risk Control Department supervises the correct functioning of the current system of discretionary management of operating limits, which are always granted on the basis of the collateral (securities) deposited with the Group. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts signed with customers, the Group may dispose of customers' securities and investment fund shares in order to compensate the customer's debit balances in the event of non-payment (non-replenishment of funds) by the customer.\n\n#### **a.2 Total credit risk exposure**\n\nThe following table shows the total credit risk exposure at year-end 2023 and 2022, using the criteria established for the calculation of the basis of the impairment provision:\n\nThe total risk exposure includes the consolidated balance sheet items detailed in the table above excluding valuation adjustments. At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the maximum level of credit risk exposure, without taking into account collateral and other credit enhancements, does not differ from the carrying amount shown in these financial statements.\n\nLoans and advances - Credit institutions: the main item in this portfolio is financial guarantees with foreign credit institutions.\n\nLoans and advances - Client: these are basically debit balances with private individuals in connection with securities transactions, for which the positions held by these customers with the Group are collateralised. Where the Group classifies these balances as impaired, impairment losses are determined by taking into account the value of these positions that are used as collateral.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022 there are no individual exposures in breach of the limits set by the Bank of Spain. The distribution of the total country credit risk exposure by country as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is shown below.\n\n|                                                                              | 2023      | 2022      | Thousands of Eur |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits                     | 1,093,149 | 771,361   |                  |\n| Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income | 314,066   | 828,427   |                  |\n| Central banks                                                                | -

The credit quality of the customer credit portfolios and other equity instruments is not disclosed as most of the Group's exposure is not externally rated.\n\n#### **a.4 Credit risk for construction and real estate development financing**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no lending operations for the financing of construction and property development activities. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no loans granted for house purchases. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no foreclosed assets from financing to construction and property development companies.\n\n#### **a.5 Loan and credit refinancing and restructuring policy.**\n\nThe Group uses the following definitions:\n\n· Refinancing operation: a transaction which, regardless of the holder or collateral, is granted or used for economic or legal reasons related to the holder's financial difficulties to cancel one or more transactions granted by the institution itself or by other institutions in its group to the holder or to one or more other companies in its economic group, or by which such transactions are brought fully or partially up to date with payments, in order to enable the holders of the cancelled or refinanced transactions to repay their debt (principal and interest) because they are unable, or are expected to be unable, to meet their conditions in due time and form.\n\n· Refinanced operation: an operation that is fully or partially brought current as a result of a refinancing operation carried out by the institution itself or another entity of its economic group.\n\n· Restructured transaction: a transaction in which, for economic or legal reasons related to the holder's financial difficulties, its financial conditions are modified in order to facilitate the payment of the debt (principal and interest) because the holder is unable, or is expected to be unable, to comply with those conditions in due time and form, even if such modification was foreseen in the contract. In any case, operations in which a write-down is made or assets are received to reduce the debt, or in which the terms of the debt are modified to lengthen its maturity, vary the amortisation schedule to reduce the amount of the instalments in the short term or reduce their frequency, are considered to be restructured, or establish or lengthen the grace period for principal, interest or both, except where it can be proven that the terms are modified for reasons other than the financial difficulties of the holders and are similar to those applying in the market at the date of modification to transactions granted to customers with a similar risk profile.\n\n· Rollover transaction: a transaction entered into to replace a transaction previously granted by the institution itself, without the borrower having, or being expected to have in the future, financial difficulties, i.e. the transaction is entered into for reasons other than refinancing.\n\n· Renegotiated transaction: a transaction in which the financial terms of the transaction are changed without the borrower having, or being expected to have in the future, financial difficulties, i.e. where the terms are changed for reasons other than restructuring.\n\nIn any case, in order to classify a transaction as a renewal or renegotiated transaction, the holders must have the capacity to obtain on the market, on the date of renewal or renegotiation, transactions for an amount and with financial conditions similar to those applied by the entity, and these must be adjusted to those granted on that date to customers with a similar risk profile.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 the Group has six refinancing operations (six operations at 31 December 2022), refinanced or restructured for an amount of €6.313 million (€8.105 million at 31 December 2022) covered by securities collateral for an amount of €9.397 million (€8.748 million at 31 December 2022). These operations will mature in 2024.\n\n#### **a.6 Concentration**\n\nThe following is a detail of the concentration of risks as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 by activity and geographical

(subsidiary) must comply with a liquidity ratio whereby it must maintain a volume of investments in highly liquid, low-risk assets for an amount equivalent to 10% of its liabilities with a residual term of less than one year, excluding instrumental and transitory credit accounts (brokerage clients).\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/876 introduced reporting requirements on the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The latest amendments entered into force on 28 June 2021 (Article 17 of Implementing Regulation 2021/451) for the data of the same month.\n\nThe NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to the amount of stable funding required and requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. This ratio shall be at least 100% at all times.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the group was in compliance with the liquidity ratio.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main components of the NSFR ratio and the LCR ratio as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are shown below:\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                                                | Thousands of Euro |                                 |                                  | Financial year 2022                                                                                |           |                                   |                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                    | Amount            | Stable<br>financing<br>required | Stable<br>financing<br>available |                                                                                                    | Importe   | Financiación<br>estable requerida | Financiación<br>estable<br>disponible |\n| STABLE FINANCING REQUIRED                                                                          | 2,092,936         | 561,574                         | -

However, the Group periodically measures the risk of these positions using the VaR (Value at risk) methodology, which expresses the maximum expected loss for a specific time horizon determined on the basis of the historical performance of a security or portfolio. The VaR of these portfolios (at 1 day and for a confidence level of 98.75%) as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n#### **c.1) Foreign exchange risk**\n\nThe Group's exposure to this risk corresponds mainly to its investment in South America, although it is not significant.\n\n#### **c.2) Interest rate risk**\n\nThis is defined as the possibility that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group as a whole. These changes may arise as a result of movements in yield curves or in the credit spreads applied to counterparties.\n\nThe Directors consider the exposure to this risk to be insignificant. In accordance with current regulations, the Renta 4 Group analyses the adverse impact on its economic value and net interest income of a change in interest rates, without in any case exceeding the limits established for the aggregation of own funds to cover this type of risk\n\n#### **d) Other risks**\n\nAs a result of the investments held by the Group in foreign countries, as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 there are no restrictions on its ability to access or utilise the assets and settle the liabilities.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs described in Note 4.f), except for financial instruments classified under \"Financial assets at amortised cost\" and equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the Group's financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.\n\nSimilarly, except for financial liabilities recognised under \"Financial liabilities at amortised cost\", all other financial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDetails of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are presented below by class of financial assets and liabilities and at the following levels:\n\n**LEVEL 1:** Financial instruments whose fair value has been determined by taking their quoted market price in active markets, without making any changes to those assets.\n\n**LEVEL 2:** Financial instruments whose fair value has been estimated on the basis of quoted prices in organised markets for similar instruments or by using other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are based on directly or indirectly observable market data.\n\n**LEVEL 3:** Instruments whose fair value has been estimated using valuation techniques in which some significant input is not based on observable market data.\n\nThe principal valuation methods, assumptions and inputs used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments classified in Levels 1, 2 and 3 (there are no financial instruments classified) by type of financial instrument at 31 December 2022 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n· Derived from negotiation: The fair value of most proprietary trading derivatives has been determined on the basis of quoted prices in organised markets for similar instruments or by using other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are based on directly or indirectly observable market data (Level 2).\n\n· Debt securities: The fair value of debt instruments has been determined on the basis of quoted prices on official markets (Bank of Spain's Central Book-Entry System), BME Clearing panels (credit institutions) or by applying prices obtained from information service providers who construct their prices on the basis of prices reported by contributors. Spanish government debt securities listed on an active market have been considered in Level 1, while private debt securities have been considered in Level 2.\n\n· Equity instruments: For the determination of the fair value of all the Group's investments in quoted equity instruments, quoted prices on official markets have been used and these have therefore been classified in Level 1 of the above tables. Following a prudent approach, in the event that any of the inputs used in the valuation are not observable on the market, the instruments (FCR/ SCR) will be classified at Tier 3. Similarly, costvalued capital instruments are classified at Tier 3.\n\nDuring the financial years 2023 and 2022 there have been no transfers between levels, nor have there been any significant changes in the valuation of unquoted equity instruments included in the portfolio of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe amounts recognised in the profit and loss accounts in 2022 and 2022 for changes in the fair value of the Bank's financial instruments, corresponding to unrealised gains and losses, distinguishing between those financial instruments whose fair value is determined by reference to published market prices in active markets (Level 1), is estimated using a valuation technique whose inputs are obtained from observable market data (Level 2) and the remainder (Level 3), together with the cumulative changes in value at 31 December 2023 and 2022 that have not materialised, are not significant for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Financial liabilities**\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the breakdown of the balance of this heading is as follows:\n\n|                                        |                  |            | Fair Value Hierarchy |         |         |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| 31/12/2023                             | Total<br>Balance | Fair Value | Level 1              | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n| Financial liabilities held for trading | -

The Board of Directors is the highest operational decision-making body of each business. The definition of the business segments takes into account the inherent risks and management particularities of each segment. Likewise, the segregation of activity and results by business is based on the basic business units, for which accounting and management figures are available. The same general principles are applied as those used in the Group's management information, and the measurement, valuation and accounting principles applied are basically the same as those used in the preparation of the financial statements.\n\nThe business lines described below have been established based on the Group's organisational structure in place at year-end 2023 and 2022, taking into account the nature of the services offered and the customer segments at which they are targeted.

(generated on the acquisition of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C.), Renta 4 Pensiones, E.G.F.P., S.A. and Renta 4 Luxembourg, S.A.\n\nUntil 2015, the Group had recorded other goodwill associated with the \"Chile\" CGU; this goodwill was identified with the expected business to be generated by the sale of other services offered by the Renta 4 Group to Chilean customers (brokerage, asset management-investment funds, pension funds and portfolio management), and by the possible expansion of the customer portfolio in Chile due to the possibility of operating in the Spanish market. However, in 2015, based on the results obtained\n\nby this CGU, the directors considered it necessary to recognise impairment losses of €129,000 in this CGU, recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment of non-financial assets - Intangible assets\" in the consolidated income statement for 2015 (Note 22-g). As a result of this impairment, as at 31 December 2015, the goodwill of the Chile CGU was fully impaired.\n\nThe Group has performed an impairment test on the goodwill at 31 December 2023 and 2022 of the \"Trading\" CGU and the \"Management\" CGU, based on the assumptions set out below.\n\nThe impairment test performed by the Parent Company has been verified by an independent expert who, on 15 February 2024, issued a report on the impairment test and the correct valuation of the goodwill at 31 December 2023 and therefore no impairment has been recognised in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAccordingly, and based on the estimates and projections available to the Bank's directors, no impairment losses have been incurred during 2023 that would have required the recording of additional impairment losses.\n\nAccording to the regulations, impairment occurs when the net book value exceeds the recoverable amount,\n\nwhich is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In this case, the recoverable amount of the above CGUs has been determined following an income approach; specifically, the dividend discount methodology has been used based on cash flow projections based on the budgets approved by the Group's management as follows:\n\nThe main assumptions used according to the above methodology are described below:\n\n#### **a.1 Projected period**\n\nAs required by paragraph 33 (b), from IAS 36, the projected period considered for the estimation of future cash flows in both CGUs is 5 years, in accordance with the budgets approved by the Group's management for the next 5 years. We believe that this period is adequate to reflect the current business plan projected for each of them.\n\n#### **a.2 Discount rate**\n\nThe discount rates reflect management's estimate of unit-specific risk. This is the benchmark used by management to assess operational development and future investment proposals. The discount rate applied to calculate the value in use of each of the CGUs at the valuation date was the cost of equity, and was determined in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\n\nThis model uses as a basis the risk-free rate (Rf), which has been calculated by considering the average yield of the last three months of 2023 on the Spanish 10-year government bond for the Intermediation CGU, to which is added the market risk premium (Rm) multiplied by the beta coefficient considered appropriate for the CGU's risk and growth profile.\n\nThe result obtained, as shown in the table above, is 10.96% and 10.61% for Intermediation CGU's and Management respectively (2022: 11.05% for the Intermediation CGU and 10.64% for the Management).\n\n## **a.3 Perpetual growth rate**\n\nFor the calculation of the perpetual growth rate, the estimate of long-term inflation from public sources has been used, as well as the potential growth of the asset management and brokerage industry on such inflation. The growth rate used was 2.68% and 2.55% in the Cash Generating Unit of Intermediation and Management respectively (2022: 2.66% and 2.52% in the Cash Generating Unit of Intermediation and Management respectively).\n\nThe Management of these CGUs considers that this growth rate is justified.\n\n**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**\n\nIn order to ensure the soundness of its calculation, management has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the value in use of the different CGUs analysed with respect to changes in the main assumptions affecting this calculation. For this purpose, sensitivity analyses have been carried out for the discount rate, the perpetual growth rate and the required capital requirements. The main results are shown below:\n\n|                         |        |                                     | Thousands of Eur |\n|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                         | Cost   | Value corrections due to impairment | Total            |\n| Balances as at 31.12.21 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n| Movements               | -      | -                                   | -                |\n| Balances as at 31.12.22 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n| Movements               | -      | -                                   | -                |\n| Balances as at 31.12.23 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n\n|                                  |         |         | Thousands of Eur |  |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|--|\n| Intermediation CGU               | 2023    | 2022    |                  |  |\n| Projected period                 | 5 years | 5 years |                  |  |\n| Discount rate (projected period) | 10.96%  | 11.05%  |                  |  |\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.68%   | 2.66%   |                  |  |\n| CGU Management                   | 2024    | 2022    |                  |  |\n| Projected period                 | 5 years | 5 years |                  |  |\n| Discount rate (projected period) | 10.61%  | 10.64%  |                  |  |\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.55%   | 2.52%   |                  |  |\n\n# <span id=\"page-50-0\"></span>Intangible Assets\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **a.4 Intermediation and Management CGUs**\n\nReasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the discount rate used combined with reasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the growth rate in perpetuity compared to the baseline scenario would not result in impairment of the either of the CGUs.\n\nSimilarly, reasonable changes of +/-100 basis points in the discount rate used combined with reasonable changes of +/-0.25 times in the minimum capital requirement for the CGU compared to the baseline scenario would not cause deterioration in either of the CGUs.\n\nAlso, reasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the perpetual growth rate used combined with reasonable variations of +/-0.25 times in the minimum capital requirement for the CGU compared to the baseline scenario would not cause deterioration in either of the CGUs.\n\n#### **b) Other intangible assets**\n\nThis section of the consolidated balance sheets includes the software acquired from third parties, the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Gesdinco S.A., S.G.I.I.C. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.G.C., S.A., the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores Bolsa, S.A. and the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of BNP Paribas, S.A.'s branch of activity, the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. and the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of the branch of activity of BNP Paribas, Sucursal en España, S.A . which have had the following movements in financial years 2023 and 2022:\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 \"Other intangible assets\" includes the fully amortised customer portfolio of Gesdinco and Padinco (€815,000 cost and €815,000 accumulated amortisation).

The triangle occupies a significant portion of the lower left area of the image, with one of its sides forming a diagonal line that extends upwards and to the right. The background has a subtle, grainy texture that gives it a slightly aged or weathered appearance. The contrast between the smooth, deep red of the triangle and the textured, lighter background creates a visually striking composition.\n\nThe following is the accounting statement prepared by the Parent Company's Directors based on its individual results, which showed the existence of sufficient liquidity for the distribution of an interim dividend out of the profits for the financial year 2022 for a gross amount of €10.155 million:\n\nThe Parent Company has sufficient liquidity at that date to pay the dividend.\n\n#### **h) Earnings per share**\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the average number of ordinary shares that will be issued if the shares are potentially converted.\n\n#### Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented below:\n\n#### **i) Minimum own resources**\n\nOn 26 June 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter \"CRR\"), and Directive 2013/36/EU on the taking up of the business of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter \"CRD\"), which entered into force on 1 January 2014, with progressive implementation until 1 January 2019 and which entails the repeal of the solvency regulations in force to date.\n\nThe CRR and the CRD have been developed in the delegated aspects indicated in the same regulation mainly through Regulations (EU), Delegated Regulations (EU) of the European Commission and EBA Guidelines, with particular relevance of Regulation (EU) 876/2019 which amends Regulation EU 575/2013 by incorporating amendments to the leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, own funds and eligible liabilities requirements, counterparty risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, and reporting and disclosure requirements.\n\nThe CRR and the CRD regulate capital requirements in the European Union and reflect the recommendations set out in the Basel III Capital Accord, in particular:\n\n· The CRR, which is directly applicable by Member States, contains the prudential requirements to be implemented by credit institutions and, among other aspects, covers:\n\n· The definition of eligible own funds items, establishing the requirements to be met by hybrid instruments for their calculation and limiting the calculation of accounting minority interests.\n\n· The definition of prudential filters and deductions from capital elements in each of the capital tiers. In this respect, it should be noted that the Regulation incorporates new deductions with respect to Basel II (tax assets dependent on future net profits, pension funds, etc.) and modifies existing deductions. However, a phased timetable for full implementation is established.\n\n· The minimum requirements are set out in Art. 92 CRR, establishing three levels of own funds: ordinary Tier 1 capital with a minimum ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital with a minimum ratio of 6% and total capital with a minimum required ratio of 8%. However, the competent authority has the power to require additional own funds requirements.\n\n· The requirement for financial institutions to calculate a leverage ratio, which is defined as the Bank's Tier I capital divided by total assumed exposure not adjusted for risk.\n\nThe main object and purpose of the CRD, which is to be implemented by Member States in their national legislation at their discretion, is to coordinate national provisions concerning access to the business of credit institutions and investment firms, their governance arrangements and their supervisory framework.\n\nThe CRD, among other aspects, includes additional capital requirements over and above those established in the CRR, the non-compliance with which implies limitations on discretionary distributions of earnings, specifically:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    | 2023       | 2022       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company (thousands of euro)                                                                  | 26,127     | 21,540     |\n| Financial costs of the convertible bond issue (thousands of euro)                                                                                  | -          | -          |\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company, eliminating financial<br>expenses of the convertible bond issue (thousands of euro) | 26,127     | 21,540     |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding treasury shares for the<br>calculation of basic earnings                                      | 40,681,105 | 40,620,613 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding treasury shares for the<br>calculation of diluted earnings per share                          | 40,681,105 | 40,620,613 |\n| Basic earnings per share (euro)                                                                                                                    | 0.64       | 0.53       |\n| Diluted earnings per share (euro)                                                                                                                  | 0.64       | 0.53       |\n\nThousands of Euro\n\n| Results net of tax as at 31 October 2022                                              | 16,639 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Interim dividend distribution for the year 2022                                       | -      |\n| Limit to be distributed (*)                                                           | 16,639 |\n| Cash flow forecast for the period from the date of the agreement and one year forward |        |\n| Cash balances at the date of the agreement                                            | 130,87 |\n| Projected cash balances one year from the date of the agreement                       | 143.96 |\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n· A capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer, following on from the Basel III regulatory framework and in order to mitigate the procyclical effects of financial regulation, includes a requirement to hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of common equity Tier I capital for all financial institutions and an institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer of common equity Tier I capital.\n\n· A systemic risk buffer, with the aim of mitigating systemic risks, i.e. to cover risks of disturbances in the financial system that could have serious negative consequences for the financial system and the real economy of a Member State.\n\n· A buffer for global systemically important institutions and other systemically important institutions, with the objective of covering the potential impact of the failure of institutions that, due to their size, complexity, interconnectedness, cross-border activity and/or difficulty of substitution, may have on the financial system and the real economy.\n\nIn this regard, in application of article 68.2.a) of Law 10/2014, the Bank of Spain required a total capital ratio of no less than 12.13% at the consolidated and individual level during the financial year 2023. A requirement has been received from the Bank of Spain which establishes a total minimum capital ratio at consolidated and individual level of 12.13% for the year 2024.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Renta 4 Group complies with the aforementioned ratio of 18.62%. As at 31 December 2022 the balance amounted to 14.48%.\n\nWith regard to Spanish legislation, the new legislation is mainly aimed at transposing European legislation to the local level:\n\n· Royal Decree-Law 14/2013 of 29 November on urgent measures for the adaptation of Spanish law to European Union regulations on the supervision and solvency of financial institutions: this partially\n\ntransposes the CRD into Spanish law and enables the Bank of Spain to make use of the options attributed to the competent authorities in the CRR.\n\n· The Bank of Spain Circular 2/2014 of 31 January 2014 to credit institutions on the exercise of various regulatory options contained in Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013. The purpose is to establish, in accordance with the powers conferred, which of the options of the CRR attributed to national competent authorities will have to be complied with from 1 January 2014 by consolidable groups of credit institutions and by credit institutions that are or are not part of a consolidable group, and to what extent. To this end, in this circular, the Bank of Spain makes use of some of the temporary or permanent regulatory options envisaged in the CRR, generally with the aim of allowing continuity in the treatment that Spanish regulations had been giving to certain matters prior to the entry into force of this Community regulation, the justification for which, in some cases, comes from the business model that Spanish institutions have traditionally followed.\n\nThis does not exclude the future exercise of other options provided for competent authorities in the CRR, in many cases, mainly in the case of options of a non-general nature, by direct application of the CRR, without the need for a Bank of Spain circular.\n\n· Law 10/2014 of 26 June 2014 on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, the main purpose of which is to continue with the process of transposition of CRD IV initiated by the Royal Decree-Law 14/2013, of 29 November and to recast certain national provisions in force to date in relation to the regulation and discipline of credit institutions. The main new features include, for the first time, the express obligation of the Bank of Spain to present, at least once a year, a Supervisory Programme setting out the content and form that supervisory activity will take, and the actions to be taken on the basis of the results obtained. This programme shall include the performance of a stress test at least once a year.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2014 of 30 July 2014 to credit institutions and approved appraisal companies and services. This Circular, among other measures, amends Circular 2/2014 of 31 January on the exercise of various regulatory options contained in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment services, with the aim of unifying the treatment of the deduction of intangible assets during the transitional period established by the aforementioned Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, bringing the treatment of goodwill into line with that of other intangible assets.\n\n· Royal Decree 84/2015 of 13 February 2015 implementing Law 10/2014 of 26 June on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, a text which develops aspects of the regulations it implements, with particular emphasis on the activity requirements for credit institutions, the elements of the supervisory function and the regulatory development of capital buffers.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 2/2016 of 2 February 2016 to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017 of 27 November to credit institutions on public and confidential financial reporting standards and model financial statements, which completes the adaptation to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 2/2018 of 21 December amending Circular 4/2017 of 27 November to credit institutions on public and confidential financial reporting standards and financial statement formats, and Circular 1/2013 of 24 May on the Central Credit Register, and model financial statements, which completes the adaptation to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 5/2021 of 22 December amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. (BOE of 23 December 2021).\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2022 of 30 March amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2022 of 2023 March amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the Circular 1/2022 of 24 January, to financial credit institutions, about liquidity, prudential regulations and reporting obligations (BOE of 14 November 2023).\n\nIn relation to the Group's eligible own funds, the prudential filter concerning additional valuation adjustments on assets measured at fair value pursuant to articles 34 and 105 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its implementing regulation Implementing Regulation (EU) 101/2016 is applied using the simplified approach.\n\nIn relation to minimum capital requirements, the Bank applies:\n\n· The standardised approach is applied to credit risk requirements.\n\n· The original risk method is used to calculate counterparty risk exposures.\n\n· For the calculation of capital requirements due to market risk, the standardised approach has been used.\n\n· The basic indicator method was used to calculate the capital requirements linked to operational risk. \n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nSet out below is a breakdown of the Group's eligible own funds at 31 December 2023 and 2022, indicating each of their components and deductions, and broken down, as required by the new regulations, into Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital:\n\n# **j) Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nThis item in the consolidated balance sheet includes the net amount of changes in the fair value of debt instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income that should be classified as part of the Group's equity.

Of the total number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests submitted to the Customer Care Service, 2 were not admitted for processing and a corresponding case was not opened, because they did not meet the necessary requirements to be processed. The rest of the claims, complaints, incidents and/ or queries or requests were admitted to processing, opening the corresponding file and after its analysis finally dictating the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nIn relation to complaints and/or queries submitted to the Ombudsman during 2023, a total of 9 complaint files were received, of which the Ombudsman issued six (6) unfavourable resolutions for customers, two (2) favourable resolutions for customers, and one (1) case which is still pending resolution.\n\nOf the 57 cases admitted by the Customer Care Service, sixteen (16) were complaints, thirty (30) were claims, one (1) incident and ten (10) queries or requests for information, which were duly answered after requesting various information from the corresponding departments.\n\nThirty (30) claims received were admitted for processing in 2023, nine fewer than the thirty-nine (39) in 2022.\n\nAs for the type of resolutions of the complaints issued by Renta 4's Customer Care Service during 2023, there were eleven (11) unfavourable resolutions for the Customer, 37% of the total, a lower figure to that of 2022 (19) and 2021 (23).

Of the total number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests submitted, 2 were not admitted for processing and a corresponding case was not opened, because they did not meet the necessary requirements to be processed.\n\nIn all the complaints admitted for processing, both the Participant Ombudsman and Renta 4's Customer Care Service studied and analysed in detail each of the complaints and issues raised, reviewing the procedures established by Renta 4 and finally issuing the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nIn relation to complaints and/or queries submitted to the Ombudsman during 2023, a total of 9 complaint files were received, of which the Ombudsman issued six (6) unfavourable resolutions for customers, two (2) favourable resolutions for customers, and one (1) case which is still pending resolution. In this regard, it should be noted that most of the complaints were resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOn the other hand, during 2023, the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/ or requests submitted to the Renta 4 Customer Care Service totalled 57, of which two (2) were not admitted for processing because they were not considered customers of the Entity. Of the 57 cases admitted, sixteen (16) were complaints, thirty (30) were claims, one (1) incident and ten (10) queries or requests for information, which were duly answered after requesting various information from the corresponding departments.\n\nWith regard to the evolution of complaints, it should be noted that in 2023 the number of complaints received was thirty (30), nine fewer than the 39 in 2022 and a similar number to the average number of twenty-seven (27) complaints received during the 19 years that Renta 4's Customer Care Service has been in operation. This figure does not represent a significant number, being in line with previous years, as can be seen in **Graph 1.**\n\n## **Graph 1.- Total Complaints 2004-2023**\n\nImage /page/83/Figure/12 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Graph 1.- Total Complaints 2004-2023\". The y-axis is labeled \"No. of complaints\" and ranges from 0 to 45. The x-axis represents the years from 2004 to 2023. The bar heights correspond to the number of complaints for each year. The number of complaints for each year are as follows: 2004: 21, 2005: 18, 2006: 13, 2007: 10, 2008: 25, 2009: 23, 2010: 21, 2011: 14, 2012: 24, 2013: 33, 2014: 22, 2015: 35, 2016: 27, 2017: 30, 2018: 35, 2019: 25, 2020: 44, 2021: 38, 2022: 39, 2023: 30.\n\n**Renta 4 Banco, S.A.** Customer Service Report **Financial year 2023** \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's more, the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests received by the Customer Care Service and Participant Ombudsman during the 2023 financial year, a total of 66, is not very significant figure in relation to the total number of clients with assets that Renta 4 held at 31st December 2023, a total of 124,908 customers, as has been the case in all previous years, such as in 2022, when a total of 65 claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests were admitted for processing, compared to 118,239 customers at the end of 2022. In the same way, if we compare the number of complaints submitted during 2023, with regards to the equity managed by Renta 4 at the end of 2023, €30,306,348,491 or the number of commercial offices that Renta 4 has throughout Spain, 64 offices.\n\nIn summary, the number of complaints received by Renta 4's Customer Care Service and Ombudsman during 2023 financial year continues to be insignificant and irrelevant when compared to the number of clients or the assets managed by Renta 4.\n\n#### **Complaints classified by Resolution Type**\n\nIn relation to the type of resolution issued by the Customer Care Service during 2023, as shown in **Table 1,** all of the 30 complaints received have been admitted for processing. Of which, eleven (11) unfavourable resolutions to the customer have been issued, 37% of the admitted complaints, these figures being lower than for the 2022 (19) and 2021 (23) financial years.\n\nOn the other hand, six (6) complaints were resolved in favour of the customer, 20% of the total, three more than in 2022. Furthermore, in eight (8) complaints the Customer Care Service has urged the parties to reach an agreement, 27% of the total, a lower total than the thirteen (13) agreements reached in 2022, which accounted for 34% of the total. On the other hand, in three (3) of the cases the customers withdrew the complaint, following explanations and clarifications provided by the Service. Finally, it should be noted that, at 31 December 2023, two (2) claims were in the processing and study phase, of which, as of the date hereof one (1) has been resolved unfavourably and one (1) has been resolved favourably for the customer.\n\nIn cases in which Renta 4 and the customers reached an agreement in 2023, the amount paid amounted to €1,777.36, while the amount corresponding to the favourable resolutions issued was €567.01. In addition, two duly signed settlement proposals have yet to be received from customers as a result of two resolutions favourable to customers by the supervisory bodies, which would entail a disbursement of €4,037.50 for the Entity. In total, the amount disbursed up to the current date by the entity for claims submitted in 2023 has amounted to €2,344.37, which is a higher figure than the €1,086.96 disbursed in the 2022 financial year, but insignificant when compared to the entity's financial figures and much less than the amounts paid in previous years; in 2021 it amounted to €6,235.89, in 2020 it amounted to €343,806.43, in 2019 it amounted to €8,454.71, and in 2018 €24,832.61.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that Renta 4's Customer Care Service, in addition to carrying out the main function of resolving claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests, plays an intermediary role between the Customer and the Entity. After analysing the reason for the claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests and reviewing the procedures, in those cases where it is feasible, it is the Service that invites the parties to reach an agreement.\n\n#### **Complaints classified by content**\n\nIn relation to the content of the complaints reflected in **Table 2,** and following the same classification used in previous years' reports, the figures are as follows:\n\n#### **TABLE 1 Evolution of Complaints submitted to the CCS -

Classification by Content**\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, the heading with the highest number of complaints was Commissions and Tariffs, with twelve (12) complaints, 40% of the total, eight (8) complaints in the section on Investment Funds-Pension Plans and another seven (7) in the section on Others, 27% and 23% respectively of the total for each section, and three (3) complaints in the section on Securities Transactions and Order Execution, 10% of the total.\n\nThe Securities Transactions and Order Execution section includes complaints relating to discrepancies in trading and order execution, and the procedure for marketing and advising customers on the various financial products. A total of three (3) complaints were received in the year 2023, 10% of the total, the same figure as in 2022.\n\nThe complaints included in Investment Funds-Pension Plans are those where the content refers to the commercialisation and operation of the subscription, refund and transfer of investments funds and pension plans. A total of eight (8) complaints were received in 2023, 27% of the total, two less than in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, the section on Fees and Commissions includes complaints relating to the fees and expenses associated with the different investment products and services. In 2023, the number of complaints on this matter totalled twelve (12), 40% of the total, which is lower than in the previous year, but which represents the same percentage as in 2022 and equal to the higher level when fewer complaints were received under the heading of Commissions, such as in 2021 with eight (8) (21%), in 2020 with three (3) complaints (7%) and six (6) (24%) in 2019.\n\nFinally, the complaints classified under Other include all those complaints that could not be included in any of the other chapters, the content of these complaints being therefore very heterogeneous. In 2023 there were a total of seven (7) complaints, 23% of the total, slightly less than in 2022 (10) and 2021 (11), but representing a similar percentage, 26% and 29% respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, in recent years the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain have been requesting a greater amount and variety of information from the Customer Care Services of the institutions regarding complaints and with a greater degree of detail, establishing different classifications on the reasons, causes and types of products, among others. This information enables regulators to prepare annual reports with aggregated information for all institutions.\n\nFor this reason, as in previous years, this Annual Report includes information on the complaints filed from 2016 to 2023, using the classification and reporting criteria required by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain (BdE),as shown in **Tables 3 and 4** of this report.\n\n#### **TABLE 4 Evolution of Complaints submitted to the CCS -

In this regard, a ranking of 15 institutions was provided, as 30 of them had fewer than 8 complaints and were grouped in the same category identified as \"other institutions\". Renta 4 Banco occupied an intermediate position in this ranking.\n\n# **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn summary, the Renta 4 Customer Care Service considers that the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/ or requests received during 2023, a total of 57 from the Renta 4 Customer Service Department and 9 received by the Ombudsman, having remained stable with respect to 2022, and continues being an insignificant figure, both in absolute and relative terms, when compared with the total number of the Entity's customers, with the assets managed by Renta 4 or with respect to the amounts claimed in the same. On the other hand, the evolution of the number of complaints since the start of its activity in 2004 and up to 2023 continues to be of little relevance and remains stable with respect to the growth of the Entity and its business magnitudes.\n\n**Files received by the Complaints Service of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) or the Bank of Spain (BdE).**\n\nOf the 55 files received and processed by the Customer Care Service in 2023, twelve (12) were submitted by customers to the CNMV or BdE Complaints Services, ten (10) to the CNMV and two (2) to the BdE.\n\nIn summary, the number of files processed before the Supervisory Bodies during the financial year 2023 is not a significant and relevant figure in relation to the total number of files, with practically all the files being resolved by the Customer Care Service without the need for intervention by the Supervisory Bodies.\n\nIn relation to the resolutions issued by the Supervisory Bodies, on six (6) occasions the resolution has been unfavourable to the customer, on four (4) occasions the Body has resolved in favour of the customer, and at the present date there are two (2) cases pending resolution by the CNMV or BdE.\n\nA breakdown of this data is given in **Table 5.**\n\n**TABLE 5a Complaints to the BdE - Classification by Resolution type**\n\n| 2023                                        |    |      |\n|---------------------------------------------|----|------|\n| Clasificación por<br>Tipo de Resolución BdE | Nº | %    |\n| Desfavorable para el cliente                | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Favorable para el cliente                   | 1  | 50 % |\n| Desestimiento Cliente                       | 0  | 0 %  |\n| No admitido a tramite/suspension            | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Pendientes de Resolucion                    | 1  | 50 % |\n| TOTAL                                       | 2  | 100% |\n|                                             |    |      |\n| Clasificación por<br>Tipo de Resolución BdE | Nº | %    |\n| Desfavorable para el cliente                | 6  | 60 % |\n| Favorable para el cliente                   | 3  | 30 % |\n| Desestimiento Cliente                       | 0  | 0 %  |\n| No admitido a tramite/suspension            | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Pendientes de Resolucion                    | 1  | 10 % |\n| TOTAL                                       | 10 | 100% |\n\n**TABLE 5.b Complaints filed with the CNMV - Classification by Resolution type**\n\n**2023**\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 27 June 2014, Law 10/2014 of 26 June 2014 on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions was published in the Official State Gazette, transposing article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 relating to the taking up of the business of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC (CRD IV) and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC.\n\nIn compliance with the provisions of article 87.1 and the Twelfth Transitional Provision of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, credit institutions shall be obliged to publish, specifying by country where they are established, the following information on a consolidated basis for the last financial year for which the accounts have been closed:\n\na) Name, nature and geographical location of the activity.\n\n- b) Turnover and number of full-time employees.\n- c) Gross profit before tax and tax on profit or loss\n- d) Subsidies and public aid received\n\nBy virtue of the above, the information requested is detailed below:\n\n#### **a) Name, nature and geographical location of the activity.**\n\nRenta 4 Banco, S.A. is the entity resulting from the merger by absorption on 30 March 2011 of Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión S.A., (absorbing entity) and Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (absorbed entity), previously called Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A., the change of name of the latter having been registered in the Trade Registry on 8 June 2011. In addition, in the merger process, amendments were made to the bylaws of the absorbing company, changing its name from Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión, S.A. to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and extending its corporate purpose to include banking activities, as well as investment and ancillary services typical of investment services companies. The Parent Company is registered in the Trade Registry and in the Special Register of Credit Institutions of the Bank of Spain under code 0083.\n\nThe corporate purpose of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. consists of the activities of credit institutions in general, including the provision of investment services, as well as the acquisition, holding, enjoyment, administration and disposal of all kinds of transferable securities, and in particular those determined in article 175 of the Code of Commerce and other legislation in force relating to the activity of such institutions.\n\nThe activity or activities that constitute the corporate purpose may also be carried on by the Parent Company, wholly or partially, indirectly, through the ownership of shares or equity interests in companies with an identical or similar purpose. In addition to the operations it carries out directly, the Bank is the head of a group of subsidiaries, which are engaged in various activities and which, together with the Bank, make up the Renta 4 Group. As a result, the Parent Company is obliged to prepare, in addition to its own individual financial statements, consolidated financial statements for the Group. The Parent Company has its registered office in Madrid, Paseo de la Habana 74.\n\nThe Group is mainly active in Spain. The activities, name, nature and geographical location of the subsidiaries are set out in Annex I to these notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**b) Turnover and number of full-time employees.** \n\nThis section shows information on turnover and the number of full-time employees by country at year-end 2023 and 2022, on a consolidated basis.\n\nTurnover has been taken to be the amount of commissions received, as shown in the Group's consolidated profit and loss account, at the end of the financial years 2023 and 2022:\n\n|            | Thousands of Euro | Number of employees |             |            |\n|------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|\n|            | Turnover          |                     | (full time) |            |\n|            | 31/12/2023        | 31/12/2022          | 31/12/2023  | 31/12/2022 |\n| Spain      | 158,674           | 162,174             | 581         | 553        |\n| Chile      | 3,204             | 4,403               | 35          | 33         |\n| Colombia   | 2,669             | 2,641               | 25          | 23         |\n| Peru       | 594               | 621                 | 25          | 21         |\n| Luxembourg | 937               | 845                 | 4           | 3          |\n| TOTAL      | 166,078           | 170,684             | 670         | 633        |\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n**Renta 4 Banco, S.A.** Annual Banking Report **Financial year 2023**\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **c) Gross profit before tax and tax on profit or loss**\n\nThis heading shows the information corresponding to the consolidated profit before tax and consolidated income tax as reported in the Group's consolidated income statement at year-end 2023 and 2022:\n\n|            | (thousands of Euro) |            |            |            |\n|------------|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|            | Profit before tax   |            | Income tax |            |\n|            | 31/12/2023          | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Spain      | 31,331              | 26,223     | (9,551)    | (7,153)    |\n| Chile      | 3,171               | 2,309      | (378)      | (426)      |\n| Colombia   | 1,188               | 786        | 238        | -          |\n| Peru       | 794                 | 280        | (111)      | (39)       |\n| Luxembourg | (119)               | (216)      | -          | 18         |\n| TOTAL      | 36,365              | 29,382     | (9,802)    | (7,600)    |\n\n#### **d) Public subsidies or grants received**\n\nNo public subsidies or grants have been received during the financial years 2023 and 2022.\n\n#### **e) Return on assets**\n\nThe return on assets calculated as net income divided by the total balance sheet is 1.21% (2022: 0.92%).\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Consolidated [Management Report](#page-93-0) 2023\n\n[03.5](#page-95-0)\n\n**Risk management policy**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.6](#page-95-0)\n\n**Acquisition of treasury shares**\n\n**96**\n\n<span id=\"page-89-0\"></span>[03.7](#page-95-0)\n\n**Environmental impact**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.8](#page-95-0)\n\n**Research and development**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.9](#page-95-0)\n\n**Average supplier payment period**\n\n**96**\n\n[03.10](#page-95-0)\n\n**Events occurring after the end of the financial year**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.11](#page-95-0)\n\n96\n\n**Human resources information**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.12](#page-95-0)\n\n**Statement of Non-Financial Information** \n\n**96**\n\n# [03.1](#page-90-0) **Economic environment and financial markets**\n\n**91**\n\n[03.3](#page-92-0)\n\n**Evolution of the entity**\n\n[03.2](#page-91-0)\n\n**94** [03.4](#page-94-0) **Evolution of the sector**\n\n**92**\n\n**Foreseeable developments in the company**\n\n**95**\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe financial year 2023 closed with significant increases in global equities (MSCI World +21.8% in USD), recovering losses in 2022, and with more moderate revaluations in fixed income (which have not recovered from the previous years' fall in valuations). 2023 has been the confirmation of a multipolar world, with more standardised interest rates, structural inflationary factors, de-globalization trends and increasing geopolitical risks.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been a surprising year full of unexpected events. At the beginning of December 2022, the market deducted rate hikes of 70 basis points by the Fed (they had been 150), and 140 by the ECB (they had been 250). The financial year began by discounting an economic recession, with the inevitable slowdown in consumption. Profits and margins were going to be affected and leverage was going to be a problem in a world with a higher capital costs. The debate on inflation was very present: How high and for how long? Gross exposure to risk had been reduced, liquidity/cash levels were very high at the beginning of the year, and macroeconomic and profit estimates were significantly reduced. What happened was a very early positive surprise in the form of a gas/energy crisis or escalation in Russia/Ukraine, which was then driven by strong business profits, and led to a stock market upturn earlier in the year.\n\nSubsequently, at several times, several \"shocks\" have been faced: Bankruptcies of regional banks in the United States and Credit Suisse in Europe, conflict in the Middle East, etc. And we have had a bullish end of the year, supported by the fall in yields, picking up the hypothesis of monetary policy easing by the central banks, a scenario reinforced by the good evolution of inflation data.\n\nIntervention rates would have reached their peak after a 525 basis point rise in the United States and 450 in the Eurozone, a rise that has been particularly rapid and intense. At the same time, far from the recession fears that dominated the market a year ago, a scenario of smooth landing of the economy (or no landing at all, if the recession phase does not come to an end) is discounted. At the last meeting of the Fed, its president Jerome Powel declared that inflation will continue to fall, and that he does not contemplate recessive economic scenarios for 2024.\n\nIn essence, it has been a year perhaps more driven by macroeconomics (rates/inflation) and positioning, than by fundamentals. Issues such as quality, leverage, and profitability have been more or less important, at different times of the year, as duration/multiples, and the to risk\n\nor not to risk dynamics have leaned in one direction or another. It has also been a year of great themes, with Artificial Intelligence at the forefront, followed closely by GLP-1, but energy dependence, weak balance sheets, refinancing risks, or China have also been at the forefront.\n\nFrom a geographical and sectoral point of view, American technology has been particularly prominent. The so-called \"Magnificent 7\" (Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla, which already account for c.30% of S&P 500) have risen by 70% on average this year. In addition to the size, quality and profitability of these companies, the market discounts that some of them will benefit greatly from the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the coming years. Nasdaq Composite rose 43.4% in 2023, S&P up 24.2% and Dow Jones up 13.7% (in US dollars).\n\nWithout the spectacular behaviour of the \"Magnificent 7\", the return of the S&P 500 would have been reduced to mid-single digits. In addition to technology, the discretionary consumer sector has been positively highlighted in the United States, supported by a better consumer behaviour compared to the one discounted a year ago. On the negative side, energy, basic consumption and health.\n\nIn Europe, the Eurostoxx 50 ended 2023 with a rise of 19.2%, and the Stoxx 600 with a +12.7%. 28% of the Italian MIB 30, 22.8% of the Ibex 35, or 20.3% of the German DAX, stand out positively. The British and Swiss shares showed a worse relative performance (FTSE 100 and SMI +3.8%). By sector, the best performance has been observed in technology, banks, cars and industrials. The worst, in food and drink, health, basic resources and energy.\n\nOther exchanges such as the Japanese (Nikkei +28%) or Latin America (Brazilian Ibovespa +22%, Mexico and Chile +18%) have performed well. For its part, the Chinese stock market ends the year with falls of 14%, against the strong increases in Western markets. The weaker-than-expected recovery after a pandemic, along with regulatory swings, with an impact on different sectors, creates uncertainty and a lack of confidence in international investors. The process of tightening the regulation on the country's technology industry, begun 3 years ago, has moved to other sectors such as education and video games. The risk premium has therefore been adjusted upwards, causing a fall in the multiples traded by Chinese stocks (discounted against comparables in the United States or Europe).\n\nWith regard to fixed income, in 2023 we saw a sharp rebound in the short tranches of public debt rates, as central banks tightened their monetary policies, causing a reversal of these curves (rates higher in the short term rather than the longer term). At the same time, the resistance of inflation and economic growth were shifting the expectations of rates, toward higher rates, with more increases in 2023, for longer, with less projected decreases in 2024, the so-called \"higher for longer\" rate, which pushed upwards the sections of the curve until the end of the third quarter.\n\nHowever, in the fourth quarter of the year, and with central banks already at what seems to be the peak of the rate hike cycle, there was a sharp correction in rate expectations for 2024, year in which around a fall of 150 basis points (b.p.) of is projected, thanks to the moderation of inflationary pressures. This pushed rates back down, closing all sections of the German government debt curve from 2 years below where they were at the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, following the central bank's hikes, German debt's 6-month rate rose in 2023 by 1.5 percentage points (p.p.) to 3.6% and the 1-year rate 0.7 p.p. to 3.1%. On the contrary, with the prospects of falls for 2024, the 10-year rate ended the year falling 0.6 p.p. to 1.9%.\n\nFurthermore, risk premiums on Spanish and Italian debt remained very contained for much of the year, heavily supported by retail demand in their respective countries, offering interest rates not seen for a long time.\n\nAs far as private fixed income is concerned, credit spreads (credit risk premium versus public debt) expanded significantly in March with a sharp upturn following tensions in the banking sector, which was subsequently corrected, thanks to the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to give stability to this sector, the situation was stabilized. Subsequently, after a temporary rebound in October, credit spreads continued to yield, with special intensity at year-end, as investors bet on a smooth landing of the economy, with significant rate drops in 2024 but without a significant deterioration in business results.\n\nCommodities and precious metals have been mixed in 2023. Brent finished the year at \\$77.3/ barrel, down 10% from a year earlier. On the positive side, gold stands out (+13.5%, up to 2,072 USD/oz, acting as an asset refuge in the current geopolitical context) and copper (+2%), and in negative nickel (-45%) or wheat (-21%).\n\nRegarding currencies, the Euro gained slightly against the dollar, 3% (at 1.11 EUR/USD), having moved in the year in a range of 1.04 – 1.12 EUR/ USD. Latin American currencies have gained against the Euro, by 8% in the case of the Brazilian real and 11% in the case of the Mexican peso.\n\n# <span id=\"page-90-0\"></span>Economic environment and financial markets\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe last two years have marked the end of an era of monetary policy. We are in a new normality, where we have neither zero rates nor a liquidity free bar. With lower growth, higher inflation, higher interest rates and higher debt levels, economic agents and markets are adjusting to the new regime. Central banks face a more complex situation in their fight against inflation, and cannot respond to a weak growth context as they did before, leading to a further dispersion of scenarios. In fact, it is difficult to remember another time where the macroeconomic outlook is so uncertain and dispersed. Recession, soft landing or expansion, inflation or deflation, higher interest rates for longer, or lower and returning to neutral levels. There are arguments that can be considered valid for any scenario. Our central scenario for 2024 is still high rates (although they will be lower than when we finished 2023), inflation still far away from 2%, and low growth (for longer).\n\nOne of the clearest aspects is that the most conservative savers/investors benefit greatly from the interest rate normalization we have seen. Fixed income again offers attractive returns with a controlled level of risk. In equities, there will continue to be winners and losers in the current environment, where active management and selection of sectors and securities will continue to be fundamental, although the entry point today is somewhat worse than a year ago, after a very positive year 2023.\n\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, intervention rates would have reached their peak after a rise of 525 basis points in the US. States and 450 in the Eurozone, a rise that has been particularly rapid and intense. Central banks' balance sheets will continue to shrink (from highs, they accumulate -11% in the Fed and -21% in the ECB) but gradually, to control episodes of financial instability. It seems that inflation has hit its peak and will continue to moderate, but the target 2% will be difficult to reach, and if necessary, would be still far away (2025 at best), with possible ups and downs along the way. The underlying CPI remains below the inflation targets of 2%, and the de-inflationary path will have \"potholes\". Potential sources of inflationary pressure are energy prices (geopolitical risk) wages (still strong labour markets), and regionally, housing in the United States, and services in the Eurozone. In the medium term, it must be borne in mind that there are structural inflationary pressures (deglobalization, de-carbonization, demographics). Despite this, the market is discounting the start of rate reductions in Q2-24 by the Fed, with a total for 2024 of 5-6 falls and 125-150 basis points, reaching at the end of 2024 4.0-4.25% in the USA and 2.75-3.0% in Europe. They may be overly optimistic expectations, and the adjustment process may be slower than expected. \"Neutral\" levels would be around 3% in the United States, and 2-2.5% in the Eurozone, and would take longer to reach.\n\nFrom an economic growth point of view, after a 2023 in which the dreaded recession has been averted, the most likely scenario is a smooth landing, with weak growth (c.1% for developed economies), a slowdown compared to 2023, suffering the full impact of rate hikes and more restrictive financial conditions that will have an impact on investment and consumption. Fiscal policies will not contribute to growth, as high levels of debt and rising costs require fiscal consolidation.\n\nHowever, there are geographical divergences. In the United States, following stronger-than-expected growth in 2023 (thanks to the labour market and private consumption), the chances of a smooth landing in 2024 are increasing, where labour market developments will be key. Europe, for its part, will remain stagnant, with countries such as Germany having the greatest dependence on energy and China. In China, the housing bubble will continue to drain growth. Without structural reforms to boost productivity, it is difficult to recover past growth. In Spain, GDP is expected to slow down (to 1.5-1.7%), affected by household consumption, slowing down through moderation of employment and wages. We therefore consider for 2024 a central scenario of weak economic growth, but without falling into recession. We do not think that the Fed will activate balance sheet expansion (QE) again, except in the case of a real catastrophe in the economy and, if rates really fall from 5.25% to 4.0-4.5%, we do not feel this will result in a big monetary boost. It is a scenario that could be called \"orderly disinflation\", with soft landing followed by prolonged low growth, and with the question of how far inflation will fall.\n\nGeopolitical risks and possible \"black swans\". Geopolitical risks remain: An escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict (potential extension to the entire Middle East?), in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or China's stance on Taiwan. These are possible \"black swans\" of a binary nature and impossible to predict with certainty. Any of these scenarios would be very negative for global financial markets, causing volatility and increasing risk premiums. On the other hand, recent events will only serve to reinforce certain trends that were already evident\n\nbefore the current crisis. National security, energy, food, cyber security, which are now much higher on the agendas of governments and businesses than in the past decade. In addition to geopolitical conflicts, we must remember the 2024 elections: Taiwan (January), European Parliament (May), and presidential elections in the United States (November). Any combination of political mistakes, global events and domestic policies could turn an economic slowdown into a worse scenario, or stimulate inflation. To achieve a modest slowdown followed by a modest recovery, central banks will have to keep these opposing forces under control.\n\nScenario and prospects in equities. We believe that the process of major economic transformation and adjustment initiated in 2022 will continue in 2024-25. After the shock of 2022, where markets discounted the magnitude of the adjustments to be made (which resulted in a significant contraction of multiples), in 2023 we witnessed a \"relief rally\", discounting that a major depression or deep recession is avoidable (we are not facing a scenario of Great Depression or stagflation), which translated into multiples expansion (greater in the United States than Europe). Looking ahead to 2024, the consequence for the markets of the macro scenario described, would be exchanges in a wide lateral range, slightly bullish or bearish, but with many divergences between companies and sectors, as has happened in 2022 and 2023. We therefore expect a year of consolidation, but with divergence in value creation, where active management and selection of values will remain essential.\n\nThere are mixed signals about the direction of the economy and monetary policies. But when we talk about equities, we need to focus on the evolution of business profits. The last year has been positively surprising because of the resistance of the results to the economic slowdown, and the absence of the much feared recession (average growth of 4% BPA in Europe and 2% in the United States). In 2022, despite the equity correction, profits also grew. For 2024, in Europe the market expects a moderate growth of BPA (+5%), picking up the greatest weakness of demand and deterioration of the cycle, lower\n\nprice-setting power, and higher financial expenses. In the case of S&P 500, the market expects low double-digit growth (+11%). However, the level of profits in Europe in 2024e would be 20-25% higher than in 2021, and in the United States 18-20%. This compares to an S&P 500 that is at the same levels as in December 2021, and a Stoxx 600 slightly below.\n\nValuation levels can be considered neutral at a global level (with greater attractiveness in Europe compared to the United States), in line with longterm historical multiples. In Europe, multiples expansion has been limited in 2023, and the factors explaining positive returns in the year are more balanced (slight multiples expansion, growth in profits c.4%, and profitability per dividend). The starting point is a PER 12m of 13x, a discount of c.7% versus the average since 2000 (14x PER12m). In the United States, in 2023 there has been an expansion of multiples (recovering the compression of 2022), being the main factor explaining the revaluation in 2023 (BPA has grown only 2%). The starting point is a PER 12m of 19x, a premium of 14% compared to the average since 2000 (16.6x profits from the next 12 months). However, the high weight of the 7 technology companies with the highest weight in the S&P hides a very reasonable valuation of 15-16x PER24e for the rest of the index, which provides more support in terms of valuation than it initially seems. Valuations are not as demanding if we look at metrics such as FCF yield, with a greater weight in the indices of companies with lighter business models and greater capacity to convert to free cash.\n\n# <span id=\"page-91-0\"></span>Evolution of the sector\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>Therefore, taking into account the two key factors (profits and multiples), the a priori scenario in the United States is that of higher profit growth, but with a higher starting multiple, and Europe with a more attractive valuation, but less profit growth. With a stable multiple and fulfilment of the profit estimate, we would reach near double-digit returns in S&P 500, perhaps with a more balanced contribution between sectors than the one seen in the last financial year (less differential between the \"magnificent seven\" and the rest of S&P). And in Europe, with a slight multiples expansion of 5-10% and growth in low singledigit profits, we would reach the same near-double-digit profitability. Part of the market considers that E of \"earnings\" optimistic The delayed effects of interest rate increases and still restrictive financial conditions will be key to profit adjustment. On the other hand, the forecasts of margin expansion could be optimistic (in a context where there are still inflationary and wage pressures, and perhaps less price-setting capacity). In our base scenario (no recession), we do not contemplate a fall in profits.\n\nRegarding emerging, attractive valuations, along with monetary and fiscal stimulus, and potential for improvement of profit estimates, should support good behaviour, China is one of the big doubts for this year. Furthermore, fiscal policy support, coupled with macro recovery, and reasonable valuations, could support the good performance of the region's companies. Latin America remains attractive thanks to its natural resources as a necessary supplier in the energy transition, digitalisation, etc. Its exposure to global growth would provide the continent with a positive option should we see a faster than anticipated economic recovery.\n\nQuality and growth vs. value. After a 2022 in which we saw a better performance \"value\" versus \"growth\", in 2023 we saw the opposite, with a flight toward quality and growth.\n\nWe still believe that there should not be a binary or exclusive approach. On the one hand, we see how \"megatrends\" continue to gain importance. As long-term investors, we believe it is convenient to focus on such trends, great forces in human and technological development with the power to transform the economy, business and society. Identifying structural change and investment at an early stage is critical to positioning portfolios for long-term growth opportunities. Clearly, we believe that innovation and technology will increase efficiency and productivity. Artificial intelligence, migration to the cloud, robotics, quantum computing, cybersecurity and software are sectors that will continue to grow above the average of the global economy. In health, the development of medical technology, research in obesity and diabetes, oncology, Alzheimer's, or genomic innovation. In the environment, energy efficiency, clean energy, waste management, water treatment, packaging and sustainable transport. At the same time, we continue to see traditional market segments that are undervalued, generate good returns and are at attractive valuation levels: some industrial niches, raw materials or energy are good examples.\n\nOn the other hand, stability and visibility in results is one of the characteristics of quality investment, and in this environment, such companies should better mitigate current risks. In this context, the selection of securities becomes more important, we believe that there will continue to be a search for quality in equities. It is therefore a particularly good time to hold quality compounders, companies that can grow earnings steadily through the cycles, thanks to their good positioning in more resilient sectors, their recurring revenues and pricing power, with greater consistency of earnings in difficult times. We see especially attractive sectors that historically have been considered more defensive, such as health sector or stable consumption, where in addition to the visibility of their income, currently contribute to a relatively attractive valuation (compared to the market and its history). It is essential to adopt a bottom-up approach to analysis, looking for high quality companies at reasonable prices with the potential to generate solid revenues and performance over economic cycles. We believe that, in the current environment, active management is crucial to generate profitable growth in portfolios, and especially useful in helping investors maintain a quality bias when navigating potentially volatile market terrain ahead.\n\nWith regard to fixed income, following the intense tightening of monetary policy by central banks and the consequent increase in public debt returns, we believe that this market presents investment opportunities with attractive returns. The prospect of rate reductions has led us to increase the duration somewhat. In this market segment, moreover, we consider the bonds of supranational organisations to be particularly attractive, offering yields in some cases higher than those of the Spanish government with better credit quality. Likewise, we believe that it is appropriate to take advantage of the distortions that technical factors (supply/demand) cause in the market, having found occasions in which, for example, the profitability of the French debt was more attractive than that of the Spanish one, despite having a better credit rating.\n\nWe also consider the levels of corporate debt investment grade attractive. We believe that the current levels are an opportunity to keep improving the credit quality of the portfolio. However, following the tightening of credit spreads at the end of 2023, we believe that they will expand throughout 2024. In any case, this will be more than compensated for by falls in public debt rates. Therefore, we believe that investment grade corporate debt offers an attractive return that protects us, in addition, from a scenario of greater economic deterioration than expected. On the high yield side, we are very cautious given the scenario of macro uncertainty we are facing, and we expect default levels to increase.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nGrupo Renta 4 net profit in 2023 amounted to €26.6 million, 21.9% higher than the previous year.\n\nThe CET1 Fully Loaded capital ratio is 18.62%, which is well above the regulatory requirement.\n\nReturn on Capital (ROE) is far higher than the sector average, reaching 18.8% return on invested capital.\n\nThese high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios that allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.\n\nThe commercial activity in 2023 has developed very satisfactorily, registering a significant growth in the acquisition of assets and in the number of customers.

Also indicate the specific measures taken by the Board of Directors and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee to ensure a balanced and diverse ratio of directors.\n\nShould the company not have a diversity policy in place, explain the reasons for it.\n\nDescription of policies, targets, measures and way they have been implemented, as well as their outcome.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 33.2 of the Articles of Association, Article 9.3 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors (the \"Board Regulations\") stipulates that \"the Board of Directors shall ensure that the procedures for the selection of its members favour diversity in terms of matters related to age, gender, different abilities, knowledge, training or professional experience, and do not suffer from any implicit bias that could imply any discrimination and, in particular, that they facilitate the appointment of female directors in such a number that enables a balance representation of men and women in the Company, always in support of the interests of the Company\". The Board of Directors has entrusted this function to the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (\"ARC\") as described in Article 32.3(g) of the Board Regulations, where it indicates, among other functions assigned to the ARC, that it should \"Ensure that the director appointment procedures do not discriminate in terms of gender diversity, set a representation target for the least represented gender and prepare guidelines on how to reach such target\".\n\nThroughout 2023, the CNR, in application of diversity policies and at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the General Shareholders Meeting (March 2023) agreed, along with the re-election of Mr José Ramon Rubio Laporta, the re-election of Ms. Gemma Aznar Cornejo as an independent director for a four-year term.\n\n**C.1.6 Explain any measures that may have been agreed by the appointments committee to prevent any implicit bias in selection procedures to hinder the selection of female board members, and for the company to deliberately strive to include women who meet the professional profile sought among the candidates and that will enable a balanced ratio of men and women. Also indicate whether these measures include encouraging the company to have a significant number of senior female managers:**\n\n#### Explanation of the measures\n\nArticle 9.3 of the Board Regulations provides that the Board must ensure that the procedures for the selection of its members favour diversity with respect to matters such as age, gender, different abilities or knowledge, training and professional experience, and do not suffer from implicit biases that could imply any discrimination and, in particular, that they facilitate the appointment of female Directors in a number that allows a balanced presence of women and men in the Company, all in the best interests of the Company. In this regard, the Board of Directors has entrusted the CNR with the responsibility of ensuring that the procedures for the selection of directors do not discriminate on the basis of age and gender diversity, establishing a representation target for the underrepresented sex; and to prepare guidelines on how to achieve this target in accordance with the provisions of article 32.3.g) of the Board Regulations.\n\nIn turn, Article 32 of the Board Regulations and, in order to avoid any implicit bias in the procedures for selecting the members of the Board of Directors that might hinder and/or prevent the selection of Female Directors, provides that the ARC shall: (i) Evaluate the skills, knowledge and experience required by the Board of Directors, defining, as a consequence, the functions and skills required by the candidates to fill each vacancy and evaluating the time and dedication required to properly perform their duties. Any director may request the CNR to take into consideration, if he considers them suitable, potential candidates to fill vacancies of director; and (ii) to ensure that the procedures for the selection of directors do not discriminate on the basis of age and diversity gender, establishing a goal of representation for the under-represented sex, and developing guidance on how to achieve this goal.\n\nThe ARC has aimed to, by establishing the goals and basic principles applied to the director selection process and a series of conditions that the candidates must meet, in line with the director Selection Policy:\n\na) Encourage diversity and integration of knowledge, experience and gender.\n\nb) Reach a suitable balance on the Board of Directors that will enrich the decision-making and contribute plural points of view to the debates on the matters under its domain; and\n\nc) The proposals for appointment and re-appointment of directors must be based on a prior analysis of the needs of the Board. As a result, the ARC prepared the proposed Policy for the Selection of Directors based on the principles of diversity and balance in the composition of the Board of Directors, which was approved by the Board of Directors. In application of this policy, the ARC, for the 2023 financial year, carried out the evaluation procedure for the renewal of appointments of Gema Aznar Cornejo and José Ramon Rubio Laporta, as independent directors, in order to maintain the diversity of the Board of Directors, concluding, in the re-election of the aforementioned directors in March 2023.\n\nWhen, despite the measures adopted, there are few or no female directors or leadership positions, explain the reasons:\n\nExplanation of the reasons\n\nThe CNR, in order to continue applying the good practices in corporate governance pursued by the Company and, in particular, those related to gender diversity within the Board of Directors has re-elected, among others, Ms Gemma Aznar Cornejo. Of course, the Company will continue working along these lines, promoting diversity on the Board of Directors and prohibiting the existence of discrimination or bias in the selection of directors, especially those related to the gender of the potential candidate. The foregoing only makes it easier for the composition of the Company's Board to be even more in line with the trends, best practices and guidelines of good corporate governance.\n\nLikewise, the Company continues to apply gender diversity policies within its internal structure.\n\n**C.1.7 Explain the conclusions of the appointments committee on the verification of compliance with the policy aimed at favouring an appropriate composition of the board of directors.**\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee established the basic principles and/or guidelines on which the policy for the appointment of directors should be based, contained in the Policy for the Selection of Directors which was approved by the Board of Directors. Said Policy, based on the principles of diversity and balance in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors, is expressly aimed at favouring diversity and integration of knowledge, experience and gender, seeking to facilitate the appointment of female directors in a number that allows a balanced presence of women and men in the Company, all in the best interests of the Company.\n\nThe members of the ARC issued a positive report on the Company's corporate governance policies, which expressly foresees that the Board should ensure that the member selection procedures should foster diversity of gender, experience and knowledge, and be free of any implicit bias that may lead to discrimination and, in particular should facilitate the appointment of female directors.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the activity of the ARC has focused particularly on the application of these policies, proposing to the General Shareholders Meeting in 2023 the re-election of Ms Gemma Aznar Cornejo and José Ramon Rubio Laporta as independent directors of the Society, this being approved in March.\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/25 description: The image contains the number 106 in white font on a blue background.

State the mechanisms established to detect, determine and resolve any conflicts of interest between the company and/or the group, directors, managers, significant shareholders or other associated parties.**\n\nArticles 17 to 20a of the Board's Regulations establish the Company's mechanisms for detecting, determining and resolving possible conflicts of interest, as well as the regime of related transactions. Thus, the aforementioned article 17 establishes that \"there is a conflict of interest in those situations in which the interest of the Company, or of the integrated companies, collides, directly or indirectly in his group, and the personal interest of the director\", the latter being understood as cases in which the matter affects him or a person connected to him.\n\nThe following are persons related to the individual director: a) spouse or persons with a marriage-like relationship; b) the ancestors, descendants and siblings of the director or his/her spouse (or person with a marriage-like relationship); c) Spouses of the ancestors, descendants or siblings; d) Companies in which, itself or through a third party, fall into one of the situations described in Article 42.1 of the Spanish Commercial Code.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nSituations of conflict of interest will be governed by the following rules: a) Disclosure: the Director will inform all other Directors and, if appropriate, the Board, through the Chairman or the Secretary, of any conflict of interest pertaining the Director or his/her related persons; b) Abstention: the Director may not carry out any professional or commercial transactions, whether directly or indirectly, with the Company unless he/she has first disclosed the conflict of interest and the Board has approved the transaction. The Director will refrain from attending and taking part in the deliberation and vote for such matters. Regarding proprietary Directors, these must refrain from taking part in the vote for matters that could entail a conflict of interest between the shareholders they represent and the Company; c) Transparency: Disclose in the annual report and in the Annual Corporate Governance Report of any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Internal Conduct Regulations (ICR) governs conflicts of interest in Articles 21, 22 and 23. In this regard, \"there will be a conflict of interest between the Company and one of its clients or between two of the Company's clients when, in a given situation, the Company may gain a benefit, provided that there is also a potential correlative damage to the client, or when the client could gain a profit or avoid a loss and there is the chance that another client will suffer a loss as a result\".\n\nTo identify these situations, it shall be determined whether the Company, a reporting party to the ICC ('Reporting Party to ICC') or another person directly or indirectly related to such person through a position of control, falls into any of the following situations: a) The Company or the relevant person may gain a financial benefit or avoid a financial loss at the client's expense; b) Has an interest in the outcome of the service provided or the transaction executed at the client's expense, other than the client's own interest; c) Has financial or other incentives to favour the interests of third-party clients, to the detriment of the interests of the client in question; d) The professional activity is identical to the client's; e) Receives, or is due to receive, an incentive from a third party based on the service provided to the client, in cash, goods or services, other than the usual fee or compensation for the service in question.\n\nThe Company may determine other conflicts of interest in which the Persons subject to ICR may be involved on account of family, financial, professional or other links. All employees and Subject Persons shall inform the Company, through the ICC Monitoring Body, of any personal or family, economic or any other type of the ICR Monitoring Body, of any personal or family situation, economic or otherwise, that may constitute a conflict between such person and those of a client of the Company or of the Company itself.\n\nThere will be a conflict of interest when the Person subject to ICR, or a person or entity who is a relative or is closely related to such person, falls into one of the following cases: a) Is a member of the Board of Directors or senior management of a company whose business purpose is the same as the Company's; b) Significant stake in companies whose business purpose is the same as the Company's; c) Significant stake or another type of personal interest in a client of the Company.\n\nPersons subject to ICR will refrain from taking part in preparations and in the decision or vote, and will inform the people who will be taking the relevant decision. Furthermore, they will inform portfolio management clients of any conflicts that may arise in the course of their activity. When in doubt on the existence of a conflict of interests, Persons subject to ICR are required to inform about this to the Body in charge of ensuring compliance with the ICR, as well as the specific circumstances of the operation to allow the Body to determine the appropriate steps.\n\nThe resolution of conflicts shall always be carried out under the following principles: 1. The legitimate interests of clients shall in all cases be the priority to consider, without prejudice to the due respect for the integrity of the market. 2. Efforts shall be made to minimise conflicts between clients and between the Company and its clients. 3. The interests of the Company shall not take precedence over those of the clients in transactions with identical characteristics.\n\n4. No client should be privileged when there is a conflict between several clients. 5. They will not multiply transactions unnecessarily and without benefit to the client.\n\n**D.7. Indicate whether the company is controlled by another entity within the meaning of Article 42 of the Commercial Code, whether listed or not, and whether it has, directly or through its subsidiaries, business relations with that entity or any of its subsidiaries (other than those of the listed company) or engages in activities related to those of any of them.**\n\nYes **No**\n\n#### **E. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS**\n\n**E.1. Describe the scope of the financial and non-financial Risk Management and Control System in place at the company, including tax risks:**\n\nThe different risks involved in the operations conducted by the Renta 4 Group are managed under the principle of prudence to preserve its solvency level, profitability, efficiency and appropriate liquidity. Renta 4 Group has an ongoing management and control system for the risks taken in its business, expanding to all the companies in the Group, as well as all the areas or business units, with special focus on those that are more sensitive to the risks inherent in the business.\n\n**E.2. Identify the bodies responsible for preparing and implementing the financial and non-financial Risk Management and Control System, including tax risks:**\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Approval of the risk control and management policy [financial and non-financial], including tax risks, identifying the main risks faced by the Company and implementing, supervising and monitoring the internal information and control systems.\n\n#### **AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Supervise the efficiency of the Company's internal control, the risk management systems, including tax risks, the management of internal audit services that ensure the good performance of the internal information and control systems, especially related to the reporting processes in terms of accuracy and filing the regulated financial information on the Company and its group, check compliance with the regulatory requirements, the appropriate limits on the scope of consolidation and the right use of the accounting criteria, reporting this to the Board of Directors. The person in charge of the internal audit is required to present before the Committee his/ her guidance and work planning for their approval and make sure that the activity is fundamentally focused on the material risks faced by the Company and directly inform the Committee of any incidents that may arise in its course, as well as present the Committee with a report on its activities at the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, the Audit and Control Committee will discuss with the Auditor any material weaknesses identified in the internal control system during the audit.\n\n- Supervise the procedure followed to prepare and file the regulatory financial and non-financial information and the internal risk management and control systems related to the Company's significant risks for them to be identified (operational, technological, financial, legal or reputational), managed and reported appropriately, setting the risk level tolerated by the Company, the measures needed to minimise the impact of the risks identified, and determine the control and information systems to be used to control and manage them, ensure the independence and efficiency of the internal auditing unit, propose the selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the head of the internal audit service, and the budget of such service, receive regular information on its activities and check that the senior management takes into account the conclusions and recommendations in the reports.\n\n- Supervise the development of the functions assigned to the area in charge of preventing money laundering and know the reports and proposals presented in this regard.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **INTERNAL AUDIT**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Revise the procedures and systems established for risk control.\n\n#### **RISK DEPARTMENT**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- This body reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n- The Risk department carries out its functions on all the entities included in the scope of consolidation of the Renta 4 Group and is in charge of monitoring the established risk control systems.\n\n#### **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT.**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- This body reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n- The regulatory compliance function aims, among others, to establish, implement and maintain appropriate measures and procedures to detect any risk of non-compliance by the entity.\n\n**E.3. Specify the main risks, including the financial and non-financial tax risks and, where significant, risks derived from corruption (as described in the Spanish Royal Decree 18/2017) that may jeopardise the business targets:**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group consists of a group of companies devoted to providing special services for savings and investments and is independent of any other financial or industrial group. For this reason, it is particularly exposed to the progress of the financial industry as it can have a significant impact on its results.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the basic risks that may affect the Renta 4 Group are as follows:\n\n1. Credit risk: Credit risk is defined as the possibility of experiencing losses when a debtor violates its contractual duties, including the counterparty risk.\n\n2. Market risk: Market risk is the possibility of experiencing losses on account of adverse fluctuations in the price of the assets that make up the trading portfolio of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n3. Operational risk: Operational risk refers to potential loss arising from inadequate or failed procedures, employee mistakes and internal system errors or due to external events, in particular, natural catastrophes, mistakes made by price and information suppliers or hacking into technological systems that could jeopardise the infrastructure of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n4. Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk refers to, as its name indicates, a shortage of cash, usually resulting from an imbalance in cash inflows and outflows.\n\n5. Regulatory risk: This risk refers to the likelihood of experiencing loss as a result of failing to adjust Renta 4 Group's policies to the regulations governing its operations, of poorly documented operations or of claims and actions against the Group.\n\n6. Reputational risk: Reputational risk arises from Renta 4 Group's actions that could lead to negative publicity regarding its business practices and connections. This could entail the loss of trust in the Group and therefore impact its solvency.\n\n7. Tax risk: Tax risk is the threat of a negative impact on the financial statements and/or the Renta 4 Group's reputation as a result of tax-related decisions made by the entity or the legal or tax authorities.\n\n8. Technological risks: Risks arising from a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability associated with systems or data; or from the inability to change Information and Communication Technology in a reasonable time and cost when the environment or business requirements change. This includes security risks resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from external events including cyber attacks or inadequate physical security.\n\n9. ESG or sustainability risk. Environmental, social and governance risks that, because they are considered material, both in the short and long term, may generate economic losses or negatively impact its capital and/or liquidity. Climate change and environmental degradation can manifest in financial risks through basically two transmission channels: physical risks and transition risks. Social risks are related to labour conditions, local communities, employee health and safety and discrimination, among others. Governance risks relate to executive remuneration, respect for the rule of law, bribery and corruption, fiscal strategy, cybersecurity and money laundering, among others.\n\n**E.4. State whether the entity has risk tolerance levels, including fiscal risks.**\n\nRenta 4 Group's risk management strategy is based on implementing measures that will minimise or dilute the risks defined, setting specific limits for each business line, market and product.\n\nThe purpose of this system is to protect the Group's solvency and liquidity ensuring that the exposure to the risk is within the predefined limits and has a balanced profile.\n\nThe Renta 4 Group has a Risk Appetite Framework that establishes limits for the main risks attached to its operations.\n\n**E.5. Indicate which financial and non-financial risks, including fiscal risks, have emerged during the financial year.**\n\nNo risks materialised during the fiscal year.\n\n**E.6. Explain any response and supervision plans in place for the entity's main risks, including fiscal risks, as well the procedures followed by the company to ensure that the Board of Directors can respond to coming challenges.**\n\nThe measures to mitigate the impact of the basic risks that may affect the Renta 4 Group (the \"Group\"), should they materialise, are described below:\n\n**1. Credit risk:** To mitigate this risk, specific procedures and limits are established to avoid situations of overdraft of cash and/ or securities in the intermediation and settlement of client transactions. Exceptionally, there may be certain situations where this shortage is allowed when duly authorised. These situations are limited according to the client's credit guarantee and are monitored by the Risk Department and the Audit Unit. Renta 4 grants financing to clients through the signing of a credit agreement secured by securities, and, through the pledging of financial instruments and the continuous monitoring of their evolution, the risk assumed in the transactions granted to clients is hedged. Exposure to the credit risk in balance-sheet exposure is largely focused on cash investments (current accounts, deposits and Spanish short-term sovereign debt) all this in line with the limits on portfolio\n\nconcentration set forth in the current regulations. The assessment of counterparty risk against credit institutions is made on the basis of ratings from the main agencies that provide this information, selecting those with the highest solvency, experience and recognition in the market.\n\n**2. Market risk:** To control these types of risks, limits are established so that, at all times, in the event of variations in market prices, losses are limited to the pre-set maximums. The established controls are set depending on the conditions of the different assets and the relevance of the risk attached to each market. Within this type of risk, the Value at Risk or maximum potential loss that a portfolio may experience under the current market conditions is especially significant and is included in the risk detection systems. The Risk Department and the Audit Unit are in charge of supervising compliance with the established limits.\n\n**3. Operational risk:** To mitigate this risk, the Company has imposed minimum training requirements on employees, in addition to primary controls in the different workstations, so that control routines are integrated into each task developed. The improvements made to computer systems contribute to tightening control and reducing the number of manual processes which in turn reduces the likelihood of human error. The Risk Department and the Audits Unit are constantly monitoring and assessing any risks derived from possible mistakes, mainly arising from brokerage transactions for clients, checking that the control system works correctly. A governance model has been defined and implemented that covers the main areas of technological risk management, and includes a control framework to monitor them for internal and external management and reporting.\n\n**4. Liquidity risk:** In order to control this risk and to comply with all the requirements established in the legislation regarding legal ratios and payment commitments with third parties, the residual maturities of assets and liabilities are reviewed. The monitoring and control of the liquidity risk is undertaken by the Cash and Banks Dept. on a daily basis working with the Finances Dept. and supervised by the Risk Dept. of the Group. In any case, the policy to mitigate this risk focuses on the current policy of investing in short-term and liquid assets that could be available in the event of any stress that could materialise.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5. Regulatory risk:** The Group has a Regulatory Compliance Unit responsible for adapting procedures to regulatory requirements, as well as monitoring and controlling their correct application.\n\n**6. Reputational risk:** The Group has established a series of regulatory compliance policies, through which it directly monitors the most significant aspects that may cause this risk, which include, but are not limited to: Prevention of Money Laundering • Internal Regulation of Conduct • Marketing of Products and MIFID II, MIFIR and PRIIPs Regulations • Market Abuse in the Capital Markets • Customer Claims • Criminal Risk Management Model • Protection of Personal Data\n\n**7. Tax risk:** The impact of this risk is mitigated by independent expert actions within the framework of the financial audit, fiscal opinions requested within the framework of relevant transactions and, ultimately, by interaction with the Tax Administration.\n\n**8. Technological risk:** a technological risk management model has been defined based on the governance model and the operational model that makes it possible to clearly establish the responsibilities and competencies in technological risk management, including the main governing bodies, as well as the internal regulations and the main technological risk management processes.\n\n**9. ESG risks:** The Group integrates these risks into its current procedures, adopting a global approach for their identification, evaluation, monitoring and mitigation, specifically in relation to sustainable finance, incorporating ESG criteria in the product catalogue, implementing ESG advice and management preferences for clients, reporting the actions carried out, developing processes and methodology for environmental risk management and adapting favourable capital treatments to ESG-related exposures.\n\n## **F. INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)**\n\nDescribe the mechanisms that comprise the risk control and management systems in relation to internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) at your company.\n\n#### **F.1. The company's control environment.**\n\nProvide information, stating the main features, on at least the following:\n\n**F.1.1 Which bodies and/or units are responsible for (i) the existence and maintenance of a proper ICFR system; (ii) its implementation; and (iii) its supervision**\n\n#### **BOARD OF DIRECTORS.**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco is ultimately in charge of the implementation and maintenance of an appropriate and effective ICFR which, in line with its Regulations, it entrusts to the Audit and Control Committee.\n\n#### **AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE.**\n\nThe Regulations of the Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco, in their Article 31, foresee that the basic duties of the Audit and Control Committee in connection with the internal information and control systems are as follows:\n\n1.Supervise the effectiveness and the management of the internal auditing services in the Company that will ensure the good performance of the internal information and control systems, especially related to the preparation processes in terms of accuracy and filing the regulated financial information on the Company and its group, checking compliance with regulatory requirements, the appropriate limits on the scope of consolidation and the right use of the accounting criteria, and reporting this to the Board of Directors.The person in charge of the internal audit is required to present before the Committee his/her yearly work planning and directly inform the Committee of any incidents that may arise in its course, as well as report to the Committee on its activities at the end of each fiscal year.\n\n2.Supervise the process followed to prepare and file the regulated financial information and the internal risk management and control systems related to the Company's significant risks for them to be identified (operational, technological, financial, legal or reputational), managed and reported appropriately, setting the risk level tolerated by the Company, the measures needed to minimise the impact of the risks identified, and determine the control and information systems to be used to control and manage them, ensure the independence and efficiency of the internal auditing unit, propose the selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the head of the internal audit service, and the budget of such service, receive regular information on its activities and check that the senior management takes into account the conclusions and recommendations in the reports.\n\n3.Check the Company's accounts, ensure compliance with the legal requirements and the right use of the standard accounting principles, and inform about the proposals to change the accounting principles and criteria suggested by the management.\n\n4.Previously review and report to the Board of Directors about: (i) financial information that, being listed, the Company is to disclose on a regular basis, making sure that the interim statements are prepared following the same accounting criteria as the yearly statements and, for such purposes, consider if it is convenient to request a limited review from the Company's external auditor; (ii) the issue or purchase of shares in entities with a special purpose or based in countries or jurisdictions that are considered tax havens, as well as any other transaction or operation of a similar nature that, due to its complexity, could hinder the transparency of the group to which the Company belongs; (iii) and of linked operations.\n\n5.Receive from employees, confidentially but not anonymously, written communications on possible irregularities with a potential relevance, especially financial or accounting ones, that they may detect in the Company or its group companies.\n\n6.Ensure compliance with the internal codes of conduct and the rules of corporate governance as well as the regulations on markets in the industry.\n\n7.Supervise the development of the functions assigned to the area in charge of preventing money laundering and know the reports and proposals presented in this regard.

(the Parent Company) and its group subsidiaries, hereinafter Renta 4, issues this Statement of Non-financial Information for the financial year 2023 as an annex to the Consolidated Management Report presented with the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nThis report is public and can be consulted on the corporate website *https://www.renta4banco.com/es*\n\nRenta 4 has analysed the requirements of Law 11/2018, taking into account the opinion of its main stakeholders. To this end, the Group has identified the following stakeholders: customers, professionals, shareholders, the environment and suppliers.\n\nThe Renta 4 Group's business model, based on proximity and relationship with society, through the provision of products, services and investment solutions allows for continuous access to these stakeholders by all operating lines, control areas (risks, regulatory compliance, and internal audit), and, especially, senior management and members of the Board of Directors, who are fully aware of the most relevant aspects in the economic, social and environmental fields.\n\nThis continuous interrelationship means the company gets to know each stakeholder's needs to establish lines of action, responding to them in a timely manner.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. is ultimately responsible for all aspects arising from the management and control of the risks inherent to the activity carried out by Renta 4. Thus, at the request of the Board of Directors, a Risk Appetite Framework, different risk management policies, and risk control structures have been set up to ensure their correct application.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework is a statement of the aggregate level of risk types that Renta 4 is willing to accept or avoid to achieve its business purposes. It is also a tool that uses metrics to monitor each of the risks, establishing different policies for appropriate risk management.\n\nTherefore, the Risk Appetite Framework includes a commitment to economic and social sustainability, especially emphasising compliance with policies for the prevention of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism, ESG, regulatory compliance, the code of conduct in stock markets (Internal Code of Conduct) and the handling of customers' complaints.\n\nAs shown in Annex I, *\"Table of contents required by Law 11/2018, of 28 December\",* the NFIR has been prepared following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards selected, for those requirements considered material for the business.\n\nThe scope of the information reported covers Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (the parent company) and its subsidiaries for the year 2023, both nationally and internationally.\n\n# <span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>Basis for the preparation of the non-financial information statement\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 is composed of a number of companies dedicated to the provision of investment and asset management services, and Renta 4 Banco S.A. is the parent company. The most representative companies in terms of income and services offered within the Group are the following:\n\n- **Renta 4 Banco S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Pensiones SGFP S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 S.V. S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Corporate S.A.**\n\nRenta 4 operates mainly in the national territory, although a non-significant part of its activity is carried out in Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Luxembourg with similar customers and products offered in all the countries. Apart from physical offices, the other channel through which Renta 4 provides services to its customers is the online broker.\n\n#### The Group's main business lines are as follows:\n\n• Brokerage: Activities of buying and selling securities and other financial instruments on national and international securities markets.\n\n• Asset management and marketing: Management of CIIs, ECIs, ECRs and pension funds managed by the managing entities of the group; discretionary management of portfolios, either those of the managers of the group or of third party managers; and marketing of CIIs, ECIs, ECRs, alternative investments and pension funds, managed by the entity itself and third parties.\n\n• Corporate and other services: Services to companies and other activities not included in the previous lines of business. This segment includes the activities of securities deposit, CII depository, corporate advice, assurance and placement of issues and public offers, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe Renta 4 business model offers quality financial services to investors and savers by providing specialised independent advice and the best products available in the market, to meet their needs.\n\nIn December 2021, a new Strategic Plan called \"Plan More\" was communicated to the market with the aim of starting, from 2022, a new stage of growth in Renta 4 Banco. With the new Plan, there is an evolution in the activity of the Bank, which starts to offer traditional banking services (cards, payments and collections, direct debit, receipts, deposits, etc.) and that directly affects the management of the balance sheet itself, although without losing sight of the position acquired as a bank specialising in investment services.\n\nThe model expansion aims to access new segments of customers, essentially young and new savers who want to invest, but who are not only looking for an investment product provider, but are looking for a bank that meets all the basic needs of a commercial bank (direct debit of payroll and receipts, card, payments and collections, tax payments, etc.).\n\nThis plan incorporates a series of initiatives focused mainly on growing in the retail segment of customers. A specialised and \"inclusive\" bank model is proposed for all types of customers, incorporating \"more\" product and \"more\" service, covering a greater number and diversity of customers, as an essential element to generate growth and value in the long term. The idea, therefore, is not to renounce the competitive difference that Renta 4 Banco has acquired as a benchmark in specialised investment services, but to expand offering, in a complementary way, traditional banking services to strengthen the business model.\n\nThe model extension has had an effect on the organisation of the Group, which has led to the creation of new areas such as: management of payment methods, bank-insurance operator. In addition, the functions of the treasury department have been expanded. A new business unit has been formed focused on the development of the Plan More, the brand image has been changed to give visibility to the strategic change and, in parallel, significant investment has been made in computer resources and media in order to join various platforms and have all the necessary capabilities to provide banking services and maintain a high and sustainable pace of growth.\n\n#### **1. Group Structure**\n\nThe activity of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. focuses mainly on the provision of investment and asset management services. The entity has a network of 67 offices, of which 63 are located in the main capitals and cities of the Spanish provinces, and the remaining 4 offices in the capital of each country listed above, with an average workforce of 657 workers in 2023.\n\nThe distribution network is complemented by sales agents and partners.\n\nIn addition, the Group has a website, www.r4.com,and an app for the main business unit, which make it possible for its customers to operate in national and international markets.\n\nIn addition, it has numerous customer support services, including; a telephone customer service with long customer service hours, permanent access to market news, analyst databases on companies from all major exchanges, alert services, access to technical comments and charting tools.\n\nIn the same way as the commercial area of the bank, other business units have their own websites, including:\n\n**www.renta4gestora.com,** for Renta 4 Gestora\n\n**www.renta4pensiones.com,** for Rent 4 Pensions\n\n**www.renta4banco.com,** for institutional information and shareholders\n\n**corporate.r4.com,** for the Renta 4 Corporate Finance website\n\n**wealth.r4.com,** for the Renta 4 Wealth Management website\n\nAnd other websites such as fundacionrenta4.org, blog.r4.com among others, for other areas and functions.\n\nInternationally, Renta 4 also has physical offices in Peru and Chile, in addition to offering the possibility to customers in these two regions to contract Renta 4 products through its own website. Furthermore, a representative office and a company dedicated to the trust business are established in Colombia. The international business of Renta 4 is completed by the CII management company in Luxembourg.\n\nBusiness units in international markets have their own websites:\n\n**www.renta4.cl,** for the Renta4 website in Chile\n\n**www.renta4.pe,** for the Renta website 4 in Peru\n\n**www.renta4global.com,** for the Renta website 4 in Colombia\n\n**www.renta4.lu,** for Renta 4 Luxembourg\n\n## **2. History of the entity**\n\nRenta 4 started in 1986 as an investment services company. In the beginning, it was dedicated to the purchase and sale of public debt. In 1989, the entity became a Securities and Exchange Company, registered as number 1 before the National Securities Market Commission, expanding the investment range from Public Debt to Stock Exchange Intermediation. In 1987 Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC, S.A. was established, but it was not until 1991 that the CII management activity began, constituting the first investment fund. Renta 4 Pensiones S.G.F.P. was established in 1997.\n\nIn the 1990s a process of opening new offices throughout Spain began, starting from the 3 existing in 1990 and continuing until the current distribution network was formed. The last office that Renta 4 opened was in November 2023 in Madrid, at Avenida del General Peron No. 26.\n\nIn 1999, the strategy of territorial expansion and the multi-channel philosophy led to the development of the online platform www.renta4.com, which allowed the outsourcing of products and services through the network.\n\nIn 1999, a holding company was set up under the name of Renta 4 Servicios Financieros, S.L., which aligned the businesses of CII management and pension funds. In 2000, the intermediation business was integrated into the holding company.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Renta 4 began a process to rationalise the network through the acquisition and subsequent merger of several companies in which agents of the Renta 4 Group participated, giving rise to a fully integrated commercial structure.\n\n# <span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>General Information\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the same period, the product offering was expanded to include the marketing of ETFs and derivatives.\n\nIn 2004, as part of the company's growth policy, Renta 4 Corporate was established while Gesdinco and Padinco were acquired in 2006.\n\nOn September 29, 2007, Renta 4 became the first investment services company to float on the stock exchange.\n\nIn 2012, Renta 4 began to function as a bank by acquiring bank status from Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A. and establishing the company Renta 4 Banco, S.A. As a result, Renta 4 Sociedad de Valores, S.A. was partially spun off in favour of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nLikewise, in 2012, the international expansion began in Chile, with Renta 4 Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. and, in 2013, it was expanded by opening offices in Peru and Colombia.\n\nIn 2014, there was another important milestone for the company by starting a process to make investment more accessible to citizens, moving all offices at street level and placing them in central streets of cities.\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) appointed Renta 4 Gestora, SGIIC, S.A. as the Provisional Managing Company of the CIIs that, until then, had been managed by Banco Madrid Asset Management, SGIIC, S.A. and that no longer performs this management.\n\nA management company for CIIs was established in Luxembourg in 2016.\n\n**1 To be a specialised bank** (in savings, investment, wealth and corporate services): because to be able to offer quality and excellence of service in a scalable way, it is necessary to focus the activity. To be the best in an activity and, based on this, to be \"A SPECIALISED INVESTMENT BANK\"\n\n**2 A bank devoted to its customers:** To establish a long-term relationship of trust based on an expert, efficient and personalised service for every investor. A premise that is expressed as \"A BANK WHERE EVERY INVESTOR IS AN IMPORTANT CUSTOMER\".\n\nThis business model with its brand allows Renta 4 to occupy a differential space on the map of banking or private banking entities.\n\nRenta 4 is a \"marketplace\" for investments, but with a full banking license, that is its differential value. It differs from the large universal banks in that it specialises in wealth management and capital markets. It differs from smaller, boutique investment houses in that it offers the customer a much more comprehensive range of solutions to customers' financial needs. This makes it possible to target a very broad segment of savers, from high net worth individuals to more modest investors or millennials. In short, it is a Bank with all the advantages of being a Bank, but operating as a specialised investment firm. This is why Renta 4 is a marketplace that aggregates investment solutions for a wide range of customers. There is no other bank specialised in investment listed on the Spanish stock exchange.\n\nThe business model must reinforce this differentiation as a key to its consistency and competitiveness. A model that, when it comes to people's savings and investments, bases its success and condition of permanence on building TRUST.\n\nRenta 4 has a slogan that conveys this idea: \"At Renta 4 we are not investment managers, we are investor managers. The interests of their customers are paramount. An investor wants to know that there will always be someone to turn to if they have a problem, know that what they invest in is right for them, know that their advisers know what they are talking about, know the quality and reputation of the products and services that Renta 4 offers, know that they are charged fairly, know that they are offered what suits them and not the entity (we are not product placers). This TRUST is transmitted through:\n\n**1 La cercanía: Accessibility:** The best way to transmit trust is through closeness, personal treatment, empathy, clear and transparent communication: knowing your customers WELL.\n\n**2 Experience:** The experience that comes from being specialised and having spent more than 35 years dedicating ourselves exclusively to this on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020 Renta 4 Gestora adhered to the United Nations Sustainable Investment Programme, the so-called PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment), whereby it undertakes to incorporate environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) in investment decision-making.\n\nIn December 2021 it launched the strategic growth plan called Plan MORE, to grow in products and services, segments and, ultimately, customers. With this plan, the company also made a change of brand identity that spread to all its channels and offices. In this period Renta 4 was a team to work specifically in the field of artificial intelligence and robotisation, developing solutions both to optimise internal operations and to offer new experiences to customers in this area.\n\nIn January 2023 Renta 4 joined the PRI as a Group and signed up to its sustainability objectives and the goal of decarbonisation, also joining the NZBA (Net Zero Banking Alliance). An action with which it aligned itself with a large number of banks in the race for the neutrality of this industry in CO2 emissions by 2030.\n\n#### **3. Purpose, mission and vision of the company**\n\nThe purpose of Renta 4 Banco is to democratise investment so that every person, family, company or institution can benefit equally from a high-quality service to operate in financial markets and manage savings and investments. In other words, to offer an exclusive service with an inclusive approach to help customers protect and make the most of their savings and investments while managing risk.\n\nIn the current context of the financial markets and the uncertainty facing the sector, it connects with the Bank's mission as a Bank and as an investment company, which is to encourage investment to improve people's lives. We are moving towards a world of investors in which investment can and must play an essential role in moving towards a more sustainable and efficient world, and contribute to the progress of society. The company wants to play an important role in this new financial system that will finance innovation and the positive transformation of the economy. And it will do so as it has always done, by allocating resources well and managing risks well, helping customers invest well and helping companies find the best financial solutions for their growth.\n\nThis vision is translated into a slogan that is communicated and disseminated internally (employees) and externally (society): \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE AND SOCIETY\".\n\nTo successfully accomplish its corporate purpose, Renta 4 has established a consistent business model, orchestrating strategies, structures, developments and activities, which can be summarised in two points:\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/27 description: The image contains the number 36 in white text on a green background.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3 Quality of service:** Because when it comes to money, every client wants to see that things are done well, with professionalism and experience, but also with caring and humanity. You have to be it and look like it.\n\nAnd finally, these values must be surrounded by other aspects that in the current context are complementary, but fundamental for adapting to today's society: its habits and expectations.\n\n**1 Technology:** A high-quality service requires a high level of efficiency, which is achieved only through technology, to make this model profitable, and therefore viable; but technology is also necessary to offer users convenient, fast and accessible experiences. Growth can only happen if integration between physical and digital channels is achieved.\n\n**2 Proactivity:** Renta 4 believes in anticipating customers' needs. The greatest satisfaction comes when you notice that solutions and ideas are provided for you. Talking to customers to better interpret what they really need and thus make investment decisions easier.\n\n**3 Pedagogy:** Considering the education and financial training of customers as a social responsibility and transferring it to all the contact points of the relationship. From the first communications to answering inquiries and providing information to in-person commercial processes at our offices.\n\n**4 Sustainability:** Beyond the idea of sustainable investment, banks occupy an important space in society and, as such, Renta 4 must play a significant and committed role in improving the sustainability of the planet.\n\n#### **Commitment To Sustainability**\n\nRenta 4's commitment to sustainability is a fundamental pillar of its company strategy. Its activity, focused on the world of investment and spanning more than three decades, is based on the fundamental mission of promoting the development of society and people through investment\n\nBut the mission goes further; we have the responsibility and commitment to promote sustainable and socially responsible investment practices, regardless of the size of investors' wealth.\n\nThe fundamental values, rooted in closeness, specialisation, independence have been reinforced over the years with a strong commitment to social and environmental impact. These principles are reflected in every action that is carried out, in every relationship that is established and in every decision that is made.\n\nOver the past few years, we have promoted concrete actions that reflect our firm intention to move forward on three priority aspects:\n\n**At the corporate level,** policies have been strengthened to promote equality in selection and recruitment processes, as well as the creation of a specialised committee on ESG (environmental, social and governance) aspects, actively monitoring initiatives related to sustainable investment.\n\n**As far as our customers and financial products** are concerned, Plan MORE has met with approval. This plan, among other objectives, focuses on promoting the development of themed and ESG investments. For Renta 4, each investor is unique, and the commitment goes beyond managing their investments; we want to understand their needs and aspirations to provide customised solutions that respond to the principles of responsible investment.\n\n**The commitment to society,** which is reflected in actions that combine commercial pedagogy with the execution of training activities in financial education. These initiatives are designed to bring financial\n\nknowledge closer to the local community, empowering individuals with tools for more informed and responsible decision-making.\n\nAs a company, Renta 4 aspires to be agents of change in the financial system, allocating resources responsibly and managing risks effectively. Through actions, it seeks to finance innovation and contribute to a positive transformation of the economy. The commitment is to deliver the best financial solutions that drive business growth while promoting a positive impact on society and the environment.\n\nCaring for the environment, social factors and good governance is not simply a part of the discourse; it is a fundamental pillar of business strategy. In every step that Renta 4 takes, it reaffirms its commitment to sustainability, not only with words, but with concrete actions and a positive impact that we seek to leave on society and the planet.\n\n#### **4. Main figures of the entity**\n\nAt the end of 2023, Renta 4 obtained a net profit of 26.6 million euros, 21.9% higher than the previous year. The total assets of customers total 30,852 million euros, of which 19,155 million euros relate to its own network, while 11,697 million euros relate to the third-party network.\n\nLatin America's subsidiaries continue to maintain a satisfactory level of business and activity, jointly contributing 10.2% of the result to the consolidated Group.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total number of customers had reached 124,995.\n\nThe CET1 Fully Loaded capital ratio is around 18.62%, which is well above the regulatory requirement. Return on equity (ROE) is far higher than the sector average, reaching an 18.8% return on invested equity.\n\nThese high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.\n\nCommercial activity in 2023 registered a significant growth in the acquisition of assets and in the number of customers. The net uptake of new assets by the own network in this year has been 2,511 million euros.\n\nThe equity of customers in assets under management (investment funds, FCR, SICAVs, SILs, SCRs and pension funds) increased by 1,753 million euros compared to the same period of the previous year, reaching 12,228 million euros.\n\nThe assets managed in investment funds and CFRs amount to 4,050 million euros, increasing by 671 million euros during the 2023 financial year. There were 916 million euros managed in SICAVs, SILs and SCRs 21.5% more and in pension funds 3,909 million euros, representing a growth of 16.1% compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nAs a general assessment, 2023 was a very positive financial year for the Group, both from the point of view of the results achieved, and especially for the significant figure recorded in attracting new assets from customers in its own network.\n\nAll lines of business have evolved adequately, despite a negative environment in market volumes and corporate operations, especially regarding the growth of assets under management and the number of customers, reflecting a growing market confidence in our entity, validating our business model based on quality of service to customers and specialisation.\n\nFinancial Information 2023\n\n#### *05.02\\_General Information*\n\nhers had reached 124,995.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis good evolution, which continues and confirms the progress recorded in recent years, allows us to maintain a positive projection toward the future. \"Our goal for 2024 is to continue on the path of profitable growth, maintaining high levels of return on equity (ROE) and solvency ratios that allow us to continue with a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration\", confirms the chairman of the company.\n\n#### **COMPARATIVE TABLE OF MAIN OPERATIONAL FIGURES**\n\n|                                                |  | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | %     | Thousands of euro |\n|------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------|-------|-------------------|\n| No. Customers Own Network                      |  | 124,995    | 118,542    | 5.4%  |                   |\n| Total assets (millions of euros)               |  | 30,852     | 26,370     | 17.0% |                   |\n| Stock exchange                                 |  | 14,100     | 12,170     | 15.9% |                   |\n| FIs and FCRs (own and third party)             |  | 7,403      | 6,354      | 16.5% |                   |\n| Pension Fund (*)                               |  | 3,909      | 3,367      | 16.1% |                   |\n| SICAVs and SCRs                                |  | 916        | 754        | 21.5% |                   |\n| Others                                         |  | 4,524      | 3,725      | 21.4% |                   |\n| Own network assets (millions of euros)         |  | 19,155     | 16,299     | 17.5% |                   |\n| Third-party network assets (millions of euros) |  | 11,697     | 10,071     | 16.1% |                   |\n\n## **COMPARATIVE TABLE OF COMMISSIONS AND NET PROFIT**\n\n|                                                | Thousands of euro |            |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|--------|\n|                                                | 31/12/2023        | 31/12/2022 | Δ%     |\n| Net commissions                                | 96,509            | 98,250     | -1.8%  |\n| Comm. received and exch. diff.                 | 172,879           | 181,169    | -4.6%  |\n| Commissions paid                               | -76,370           | -82,919    | -7.9%  |\n| Operating expenses                             | -94,280           | -82,785    | 13.9%  |\n| Financial margin                               | 23,194            | 9,094      | 155.0% |\n| Result of financial transactions and dividends | 10,997            | 3,066      | 258.7% |\n| Operating result                               | 36,365            | 29,382     | 23.8%  |\n| Net profit                                     | 26,563            | 21,782     | 21.9%  |\n\n#### **5. Materiality analysis**\n\nRenta 4 has carried out a materiality analysis in order to identify the most significant issues for the company and thus, define its strategic priorities to make progress in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility. This analysis has been carried out from both the internal and external points of view.\n\nFor the internal analysis, Renta 4 conducted interviews with the heads of the most relevant areas, and for the external analysis, the most relevant stakeholders for the bank were considered. The findings of this analysis are reflected in the following chart on Materiality:\n\n#### **MATERIALITY GRAPHIC**\n\nImage /page/137/Figure/11 description: This image is a scatter plot with the title \"MATERIACH PARA TINO\".

It should be noted that pollution is not a material impact from Renta 4's activity. Rather, gas emissions, light and noise pollution should be considered. Likewise, that is why it is not necessary to make provisions or guarantees on environmental risks, nor would it be necessary to take any action to avoid food waste.\n\nThis document presents information relating to Renta 4 at national and international level, including its head office, national branches and branches in Latin America. The data is presented in aggregate form and by buildings/offices, provided that such information is available and of interest.\n\nIn terms of environmental protection, Renta 4 carries out multiple actions in the areas it wishes to influence, in the course of its activity. These areas are:\n\n- **1.** Efficient energy consumption\n- **2.**Water use efficiency\n- **3.** Efficiency of paper and toner consumption\n- **4.** Environmental waste management / circular economy.\n- **5.** Reduction of GHG emissions (calculation of carbon footprint)\n\n## **1. Efficient energy consumption**\n\nTotal electricity consumption in 2022 was 1,912,795 kWh. In 2023, the total electricity consumption 2,087,372 kWh. This represents an increase in electricity consumption in 2023 of 9.13%.\n\n#### **Comparative Table of Electricity Consumption from 2021 to 2023**\n\n| Electricity consumption (kWh) | 2,023     | %      | 2022*     | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches                      | 1,082,017 | -4.64% | 1,134,618 | 1,122,744 | 1,173,680 |\n| Head office                   | 841,788   | 17.27% | 717,836   | 615,886   | 646,671   |\n| Total Spain                   | 1,923,805 | 3.85%  | 1,852,454 | 1,738,630 | 1,820,351 |\n| Total International**         | 163,567   | -      | 60,341    | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total Renta 4                 | 2,087,372 | 9.13%  | 1,912,795 | 1,798,971 | 1,842,534 |\n| Renta 4 workforce             | 670       | 5.85%  | 633       | 633       | 608       |\n| KWh/employee                  | 3,115     | 3.10%  | 3,022     | 2,839     | 3,030     |\n\n\\*\\* The international network includes in 2023 the electricity consumption of the Chilean office, the largest and with the highest number of employees in Latin America, compared to the rest of the offices that were already reported in 2022 and 2021. These data are described in more detail below.\n\n#### **Consumption in Spain**\n\nThe total energy consumption in Renta 4 increased by 9.13% with a total consumption of 2,087,372 kWh. If we analyse the ratio of kWh/employee, we can identify a slight but positive growth in energy consumption per employee. The data obtained during the financial year are analysed in detail below.\n\nIf we analyse only consumption in Spain, in 2022 the total electricity consumption of the network of offices nationwide and the headquarters of Paseo de la Habana, was 1,852,453 kWh<sup>1</sup> , while in 2023 this electricity consumption rose to 1,923,805 kWh, which represents an increase of 3.8% overall nationally. However, it should be noted that in branches consumption has been reduced by 4.6%.\n\nThe main reason for the 17% increase in electricity consumption at the headquarters is the renovation of the building located in Paseo de la Habana 63, whose consumption is attributed to the headquarters. This work began in May 2023 and is expected to be completed in spring 2024).\n\nAs a result of this assessment, the electricity consumption that was carried out in 2022 but that was billed in 2023 has been identified. This 2022 consumption has been included in the consumption data that were calculated in 2022 for adjustment.\n\nOther causes that could explain this increase in the headquarters are:\n\n· The growth of 3% of the average annual workforce in Spain;\n\n· the return to a routine of teleworking and reconciliation with the more normalised working life, which is still much higher than the prepandemic period, but which has been significantly reduced compared to 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn the network of offices, however, initiatives to raise awareness of employees and progressive improvement of the consumption efficiency of the facilities that are being renovated year after year, have achieved a reduction in consumption in 2023 of 4.6%, offsetting even events that increase energy use, such as:\n\n· The increase of 1.5% of the offices in Spain (a new office was opened in Madrid, General Peron);\n\n· the supply for the works and increase of 5 square meters of the 63 existing offices (duplicate counters during the works and larger areas for new facilities);\n\nThe measures mentioned, to optimise the energy consumption in the facilities, are detailed below.\n\nIn addition to these measures that are a great help in ensuring that the growth of the organisation does not translate into a high demand for energy **it should be noted that, since April, in Spain, all the electrical energy that has been consumed has been 100% renewable energy.** This measure has been implemented for all of Spain throughout 2023 and will be maintained going forward. This point is detailed in paragraph 4.5 on GHG emission reductions.\n\n<sup>1</sup>These data differ from what was reported in SNFI 2022 because in 2023 invoices relating to consumption adjustments of periods in 2022 arrived, and also in order to calculate the consumption figures included in the billing period in both years, to specifically consider the electricity consumption carried out in 2023.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **International Network Consumption**\n\nInternationally, a consumption of 60,342 kWh2 and a total of 163,567 kWh was reported in 2023. This data is not comparable to the figure of the previous year because in the 2023 report it was possible to add for the first time the electricity consumption of the office of Renta 4 Banco in Santiago de Chile (95,873 kWh). By adding this consumption, figures are now available for 100% of the electricity consumption in the international network of Renta 4, which in 2023 represented 7.83% of the total of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n| International network       | 2023 (kWh) | 2022 (kWh) |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Lima                        | 44,192     | 37,545     |\n| Santiago de Chile           | 95,873     | 0          |\n| Bogotá                      | 21,459     | 20,231     |\n| Luxembourg                  | 2,043      | 2,566      |\n| Total international network | 163,567    | 60,342     |\n\nFor comparison with the 2022 report, if we do not consider the consumption of the Santiago de Chile office, the total consumption of the international network grew by 11.2% in 2023.\n\nIn the international network there was no change in the number of offices during 2023, but there was a growth in staff that during the year grew by 8.86%, from 79 to 86 employees in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Therefore, the direct relationship between the increase in electricity consumption and the increase in the workforce, at the international level, is confirmed.\n\n#### **Measures to Optimise Energy Savings at Renta 4 Facilities**\n\nContinuing with the energy saving strategy applied in previous years both at the headquarters and in the new branches, existing lighting has been replaced with more energy efficient LED lighting, blinds have been installed and facility design has been modified to improve natural lighting and thermal comfort in the following branches:\n\n- · Headquarters at Paseo de la Habana, 74 in MADRID.\n- · Office space in Plaza de Santa Ana, 2 of AVILA.\n- · Office space in C/ miguel iscar, 5-7 of VALLADOLID.\n- · Office space in Rua Lepanto, 2 de VIGO.\n- · Office space in C/ Uria, 8 of OVIEDO.\n- · Office in C/ Jacinto, 2 of REAL CITY.\n- · Office space in Avda. Del General Peron, 26 de MADRID.\n\nIn order to reduce energy consumption, in 2023, the existing conventional air conditioning system was replaced by a variable refrigerant flow control system (VRF systems) in these same four offices.\n\nIn this way, the performance of the systems has been significantly optimised with consequent energy consumption that are believed to be between 25% and 30% lower than the previous centralised ON/OFF systems.\n\nDuring 2023 the energy improvement of the building of Paseo de la Habana, 63 in Madrid was studied, with the objective of obtaining an energy label with an A ranking. To do this, a project was drafted in two phases, that encompasses the integral action on the building itself and is based on the complete improvement of the covering, the design of facilities using the most efficient technology and the installation on the roof of photovoltaic panels for self-sufficiency, to produce a building that fulfils the defined sustainability and self-sufficiency standards. The completion of the works that will include all the actions defined in the project is scheduled for 2024.\n\n#### **2. Water use efficiency**\n\nIn its strategy for the intelligent management of natural resources, Renta 4 continues to implement the improvements established previously, in order to implement a strategy and concrete objectives in this aspect of care and commitment to the environment.\n\nIn connection with this commitment, the water consumption of its office network has been monitored, although it should be noted that the data obtained from water consumption still include a high percentage of them calculated on the basis of estimates (detailed below). The following data was obtained during the 2023 financial year:\n\n#### **Summary Table of Water Consumption (m3 )**\n\n| Branches      |  |\n|---------------|--|\n| Head office   |  |\n| International |  |\n| Total         |  |\n\n|               | 2023  | %      | 20223 | 2022  | 2021  |\n|---------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Branches      | 1,958 | 5.71%  | 1,852 | 1,587 | 1,437 |\n| Head office   | 2,694 | 11.40% | 2,418 | 2,418 | 1,749 |\n| International | 780   | -6.02% | 830   | 312   | 133   |\n| Total         | 5,431 | 6.50%  | 5,100 | 4,317 | 3,319 |\n\ncy Chile, Peru and Luxembourg\n\n· Branches with water included in the community 13\n\n· Branches without invoices for meter breakdowns 2\n\n· International with water included in the community Chile, Peru and Luxembourg\n\nThe total water consumption was measured by taking the meter readings indicated in the bills. In those cases where such readings were not available or when the counters do not provide a reliable reading for breakdowns, a consumption estimation model was used.\n\nThus, in 2023 there was an increase in the annual total water consumption of 5,431 m3, 6.5% more than in 2022 (5.100m3). This increase in consumption is explained considering the following aspects:\n\n· The renovation work of the building located in Paseo de la Habana 63 (water consumption of construction, started in May and is scheduled to be completed in spring 2024).\n\n· The growth of 3% of the average annual workforce in Spain (which grew from 554 to 571 between 2022 and 2023 respectively);\n\n· The increase of 1.5% of the offices in Spain (a new office was opened in Madrid, General Peron);\n\n· the supply of 5 of the 63 existing offices (8% of duplicate counters due to the construction of new facilities);\n\n· the return to a routine of teleworking against a more regular working life, which is still much higher than the pre-pandemic period, but which has been significantly reduced compared to 2021 and especially to 2022.\n\n<sup>3</sup>Revision of the calculation of water consumption compared to the 2022 SNFI. This review has been carried out using the same model for calculating the estimate of water consumption in offices that do not present data due to having damaged the meter or having the bill included in their community expenses. To do this, the average figure of m3 water per employee per year (8.1 m3/employee/year) x the number of employees in each office is used. In 2022 there were 11 offices in this situation in the Spanish Network and 3 offices in\n\nThis same model for estimating consumption in offices without readings was applied to 15 offices in Spain and 3 in Latin America in 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> The electricity consumption of the office of Renta 4 in Chile is not included since the consumption is included in the bill of community expenses in the SNFI 2022 nor could the consumption of Renta 4 in Peru be reported. However, this figure for the 2022 financial year has been corrected by adding this consumption.\n\nthe International Network.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Improvements in Water Consumption Efficiency**\n\nThese causes of increased water consumption have been partially offset by the measures installed to optimise water consumption. Improvements are progressively being implemented to optimise efficiency in the use of this resource, both at headquarters and throughout the office network, such as the installation of timed taps, automatic hydroalcoholic gel dispensers and double tank toilets. In 2023, these improvements have been applied to the following offices:\n\n- · Headquarters at Paseo de la Habana, 74 in MADRID.\n- · Office space in Plaza de Santa Ana, 2 of AVILA.\n- · Office space in C/ miguel iscar, 5-7 of VALLADOLID.\n- · Office space in Rua Lepanto, 2 de VIGO.\n- · Office space in C/ Uria, 8 of OVIEDO.\n- · Office in C/ Jacinto, 2 of REAL CITY.\n- · Office space in Avda. Del General Peron, 26 de MADRID.\n\n#### **Measurement and Monitoring of Consumption**\n\nAs in 2021 and 2022, a high level of collected information is maintained in 2023, but there are still a significant number of supply points that could not be included because the consumption of these is paid within the respective community bills.\n\nIn 2023, 13 branches were identified in Spain whose water consumption is included in community expenses. In 2022 this figure was 11 branches, to which has been added the new office of General Peron and the new office space of Avila.\n\nThe international network maintains the same situation as in 2022 and, for the moment, water consumption data is only obtained from the office in Colombia, while Chile, Peru and Luxembourg have the consumption included in their rental agreements.\n\nIn addition, in the monitoring of consumption it is necessary to consider other types of incidents such as breakdowns of water meters. This affects the current year's billing and, in its regularisation, probably the subsequent year's billing. In 2023 two offices were identified with meter failures (Toledo and Albacete).\n\n#### **3. Paper and toner consumption efficiency**\n\nThe decision to digitise the office a few years ago was one of the most important measures that have been established in Renta 4 to reduce the consumption ratios of ink and paper. This is an effect that seeks a direct impact on the environment.\n\nAfter the abnormal effects caused by the confinement and the pandemic, since 2022 teleworking has been normalised within the company's activity, increasing consumption of paper and toner compared to that period. Therefore, the comparison between 2022 and 2023 is more useful to analyse.\n\n#### **3.1. Paper consumption**\n\n#### *Consumption in Spain*\n\nWith regard to paper consumption in Spain, the consumption of paper was reduced considerably in 2023, reducing by 45.7% in the headquarters and 32.5% in the office network. In absolute terms it represents a reduction in total paper consumption in Spain from 1,891,723 sheets in 2022 to 1,173,091 sheets in 2023.\n\nThis reduction is the result of several actions carried out throughout the financial year, such as:\n\n· Awareness-raising campaign: Internal communiqués, intranet posts and posters were displayed at printer points, with awareness-raising messages to reduce paper consumption and encourage the use of black toner instead of colour.\n\n· Campaign messages aimed at promoting the different impact factors:\n\n- Print in black and white: \"Nature prefers it in black and white\"\n\n- Using the cloud instead of printing documents: \"To print or not to print, that is the question\"\n\n- Use of double-sided printing (Duplex): \"Batman is not the only one who has two faces\"\n\n· Configuring the printers in Duplex mode: Since August 2023, all printers in the office network and headquarters have been configured with the default Duplex mode functionality, so that double-sided sheets of paper are printed, unless users specify otherwise each time they print.\n\n· This represents a direct saving in this resource in 2023 of 152,876 sheets of paper in the headquarters and 472,317 sheets in the office network, a total saving of paper of 625,193 sheets4. Paper savings represented 34.8% of total theoretical consumption (paper consumed + paper saved).\n\n| Paper consumption at headquarters | 2022    | 2023    | %      |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Printed pages                     | N/A     | 569,312 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode              | N/A     | 290,512 | -      |\n| Total paper consumption (pages)   | 781492  | 424,056 | -45.7% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*            | N/A     | 152,876 | -      |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)             | 3,907.5 | 2,120.3 | -45.7% |\n\n| Paper consumption in the office network | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Printed pages                           | N/A       | 1,216,507 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode                    | N/A       | 934,944   | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 1,110,231 | 749,035   | -32.5% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*                  | N/A       | 472,317   | -      |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)                   | 5,551.2   | 3,745.2   | -32.5% |\n\n| Total paper consumption in Spain | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Total paper consumption (pages)  | 1,891,723 | 1,173,091 | -38.0% |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)            | 9,458.6   | 5,865.5   | -38.0% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*           | N/A       | 625,193   | -      |\n\n4 This amount does not represent the subtraction between prints and duplex because when the pages to be printed are odd, there is a page that does not affect the duplex mode. This number is therefore obtained directly by the information offered directly by the control panels of the printers, considering what they display\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *International Network*\n\nHowever, in the international network consumption shows a significant increase, but this is because in 2022 no figures were obtained from Chile or Luxembourg. In 2023, consumption figures were available from Chile, the largest office in the international network, which represented a total of 165,488 printed pages, 669.4%. If Peru and Colombia are considered exclusively for comparison with 2022, the increase represented 6.2%, mainly justified by the increase in staff in these offices.\n\n| International paper consumption (pages) | 2022   | 2023    | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Paper consumption in Chile              | N/A    | 142,653 | -      |\n| Paper consumption in Peru               | 15,994 | 16,707  | 4.5%   |\n| Paper consumption in Colombia           | 5,516  | 6,128   | 11.1%  |\n| Paper consumption in Luxembourg         | N/A    | N/A     | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 21,510 | 165,488 | 669.4% |\n\nIn the absence of Luxembourg, which represents a negligible volume of printed pages per year compared to the total, sufficient metrics are now available for the adequate monitoring of this indicator.\n\n#### *Renta 4 Total Consumption*\n\n| Renta 4 total paper consumption (pages) | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Printed pages                           | N/A       | 1,785,819 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode                    | N/A       | 1,225,456 | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 1,913,233 | 1,338,579 | -30.0% |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)                   | 9,566.2   | 6,692.9   | -30.0% |\n\nIf we consider figures related to the number of sheets consumed per employee, the number was reduced from 3,022.5 in 2022 to 1,998 in 2023, a 33.9% decrease. A very positive trend, as a result of the actions carried out during the year.\n\n| Paper consumption per employee  | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Number of employees             | 633       | 670       | 5.8%   |\n| Total paper consumption (pages) | 1,913,233 | 1,338,579 | -30.0% |\n| Paper consumption / employee    | 3,022.5   | 1,997.9   | -33.9% |\n\n#### **3.2. Toner consumption**\n\nThe measurement of toner consumption in 2023 is an unrepresentative measure given that throughout the year all printers have been replaced in the facilities of Spain. At headquarters, 17 devices have been replaced, while 141 devices have been replaced in the office network. When replacing one device with another, it has not been possible to reuse the toner cartridges regardless of how used they were. In any case, the estimate has been made by taking the replacement data that have been identified in the devices in the periods that they were operating (both old and new) and adding 17 and 141 respectively for the headquarters and the network.\n\nConsidering this situation, in 2023 a total of 441 toner cartridges were replaced between B&N (Black and White) and Colour in Spain, 40.9% more than in the previous year. This figure, added to the 32 toner replacements in Latin America, adds a total of 473 toner cartridges.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that the data of the international network also has aspects that complicate the comparison, but that in order to have a figure with which to be able to maintain the annual monitoring, we consider it important to make the calculation. The aspects that influence the calculation for the international network are\n\n· as described in the previous section, the fact that this year the values of printed pages are available in Chile and that these represent an increase of more than 100%\n\n· compared to the previous calculation system counting the cartridges that were purchased, regardless of whether they were used or put into stock. This indicator was unreliable so it has been decided to take the volume of pages per toner of the network of offices in Spain, to make an estimate.\n\n| Toner units           | 2021 | 2022 | 2023* | 2023 | %     |\n|-----------------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|\n| Headquarters          | 44   | 49   | 36    | 53   | 8.2%  |\n| Office network        | 223  | 264  | 247   | 388  | 47.0% |\n| Total Spain           | 267  | 313  | 283   | 441  | 40.9% |\n| International network | 26   | 17   | 32    | 32   | 88.2% |\n| Total Renta 4         | 293  | 330  | 315   | 473  | 43.3% |\n\n\\*For information purposes, 2023 consumption has also been indicated considering only the replacements identified in the devices.\n\nIf we analyse the data based on toner consumption per employee, logically, we see the same growth effect going from 0.521 cartridges per employee in 2022 to 0.706 in 2023, 35.4% more.\n\n#### **Toner units per Employee**\n\n|                         | 2021  | 2022  | 2023* | 2023  | %     |\n|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Toner units             | 293   | 330   | 315   | 473   | 43.3% |\n| Employees               | 595   | 633   | 670   | 670   | 5.8%  |\n| Toner unit per employee | 0.492 | 0.521 | 0.470 | 0.706 | 35.4% |\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/22 description: The image contains the number 143 in white font on a green background.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4. Environmental waste management / circular economy**\n\nRenta 4 remains committed to \"reducing\" the amount of waste generated, \"reusing\" existing products as much as possible and \"recycling\" those that are no longer useful.\n\nFinally, we continue to use certified materials that ensure that their procurement, manufacture and recycling are subject to a series of environmental requirements, seeking to reduce the carbon footprint they generate and valuing environmentally friendly and social aspects in the use of the products and services contracted.\n\nTo give some examples, the purchase of paper for the printers is certified with the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) seal, which guarantees responsible forest management; and Ecolabel, regulated by Regulation 66/2010 of the European Union that allows us to know if a product or service has been produced under the policy of sustainable production and consumption, reducing the negative impact on production and consumption on the environment, health, the climate and natural resources. This together with the collection and recycling of the paper and cardboard that is consumed in the entity.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/6 description: The image shows the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo. The logo is a green square with a white tree symbol at the top, followed by the letters \"FSC\" in a bold font. Below the letters, the website address \"www.fsc.org\" is printed in a smaller font.\n\nLa marca de la gestión\nforestal responsable\nFSC® C166432\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/8 description: The image shows the EU Ecolabel logo. The logo features a stylized flower with the Euro symbol (€) at its center, surrounded by a circle of stars. Below the flower, the text \"EU Ecolabel\" is written in a sans-serif font. Underneath \"Ecolabel\", the website address \"www.ecolabel.eu\" is displayed in a smaller font size. The logo is set against a textured, off-white background.\n\nLikewise, water bottles for individual consumption, which are consumed by customers and at meetings, must always be identified with the 100% recyclable product seal.\n\nIn this regard, Renta4 continues to reuse most of the existing furniture, while the furniture that is no longer useful for the required purposes is donated to non-profit associations.\n\n#### **Computer Waste**\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Renta 4 has continued its commitment to secure IT waste management and destruction, following all the necessary procedures to ensure optimum security in the process. This avoids any kind of security breach with regard to the Group's information.\n\nFor this destruction, Renta 4 always relies on certified professionals in the sector to ensure the correct destruction of computer waste. In addition, the internal technical staff is always responsible for sending this waste for destruction once it has undergone a prior process of analysis, resetting and pre-destruction, thus ensuring that the waste is rendered unusable.\n\nDuring 2023, Renta4 did not have to make use of the service of destruction of computer waste, and in the last quarter of 2023 we decided to add ValoraData as an alternative provider to the current provider. During the first months of 2024, a massive destruction will be carried out due to the updating of 210 computer devices in the workplace, carried out at the end of the year.\n\n#### **5. GHG emission reduction**\n\nA very important step toward reducing GHG emissions was taken in early 2022. Renta 4 has established a methodology for calculating the carbon footprint in accordance with the GHG Protocol, for the calculation of scopes 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the definition established therein.\n\nThis model has been tested with the calculation of the carbon footprint for 2021 and, as MITECO data is updated, the footprint for 2022 will be recalculated. The results were added to the sustainability report published in mid-2022.\n\nThis detailed calculation of the carbon footprint will be carried out and reported on an annual basis in order to be able to diligently comply with the decarbonisation SDG established by the entity.\n\n## **Result of the Carbon Footprint for 2023**\n\nThe result of the calculation of the operational emissions carbon footprint calculated for 2023 was 1,024.95 of tCO2eq, 2.50% more than in 2022 (999.91 tCO2eq), relating to the total of Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 operational emissions. As for the financial carbon footprint, it has been reduced by 41, 90%, going from 211,480 tCO2eq to 122,862 tCO2eq.\n\nIn total, the carbon footprint in 2023 was 123,887 tCO2eq, 41.69% less than in 2022.\n\nAlthough this result is very positive, it is important to analyse the causes of the reduction obtained, understanding that the CO2 emissions relating to Scope 3 by financial activity represent 99% of the total emissions and their reduction in 2023 relates to the effect of the context.\n\nThe following sections detail all the calculations made for each of the scopes of the carbon footprint in 2023.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that this year there have been significant corrections to the emissions reported in the previous year's report due to changes in the calculation methodology, adjustments of emissions received in 2023 that related to the 2022 period and greater detail of information available.\n\n| Operational GHG emissions        | Emissions (t CO₂ eq)<br>2022 | Emissions (t CO₂ eq)<br>2023 | Change Emissions<br>'22-'23 (%) |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Scope 1                          | 87.02                        | 98.49                        | 13.19%                          |\n| Scope 2                          | 109.76                       | 72.05                        | -34.36%                         |\n| Branches                         | 85.11                        | 28.04                        | -67.05%                         |\n| Head office                      | 13.85                        | 3.95                         | -71.48%                         |\n| Total Spain                      | 98.95                        | 32                           | -67.66%                         |\n| International*                   | 10.81                        | 40.06                        |                                 |\n| Scope 3 operational              | 803.13                       | 854.40                       | 6.38%                           |\n| 1.

Emissions by scope 1 – by direct emissions**\n\nIf we consider the sources of CO2 produced by the direct consumption of fuels by Renta 4, we must evaluate three sources:\n\nAs in previous years, the first source to consider is that of the diesel generator at the headquarters. This generator is activated in case of power outage. In 2023, the generator has been disposed of for a total of 6.5h, which has involved a consumption of 147.25 l of fuel with its GHG emission effect of 0.37 t CO2 eq.\n\n|               | Consumption per<br>% of load | Consumption per<br>hour according to<br>load (l/h) | Hours of<br>consumption | Consumption (l) | Emissions<br>(t CO₂ eq) |\n|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| At 50% charge |                              | 23.10                                              | 5.50                    | 134.75          | 0.34                    |\n| At 25% charge |                              | 12.50                                              | 1                       | 12.50           | 0.03                    |\n| Total         |                              |                                                    | 6.50                    | 147.25          | 0.37                    |\n\nPAlso, another source to consider is the corporate fleet. In this regard, the company does not have its own vehicles and therefore does not represent a generation of tCO2eq.\n\nFinally, scope 1 should consider the consumption of fluorinated gases in air conditioning systems. In 2023, in the renovations of offices, more air conditioning systems have been replaced by more efficient systems, specifically 8 units have been renovated, 2 air conditioning units more than in 2022, hence the increase in fluorinated gases in the period.

Scope 2 emissions – by indirect emissions (energy)**\n\nIn 2023, the total electricity consumption of the entire office network including the Paseo de la Habana headquarters at national level was 1,923,805 kWh (as indicated in section 3.1), of which 93.9% (1,805,661 kWh) came from renewable energy sources, while in 2022 these only represented 80.2% of the total. In this context, a total of 32 tCO2eq were emitted in Spain in 2023, 67.7% less than in 2022.\n\n| Electrical energy (kWh) | 2,023     | %       | 2022*     | %       | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches                | 1,082,017 | -4.64%  | 1,134,618 | -3.33%  | 1,122,744 | 1,173,680 |\n| Head office             | 841,788   | 17.27%  | 717,836   | 11.01%  | 615,886   | 646,671   |\n| Total Spain             | 1,923,805 | 3.85%   | 1,852,454 | 1.76%   | 1,738,630 | 1,820,351 |\n| International           | 163,568   | 171.07% | 60,341    | 172.02% | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total                   | 2,087,372 | 9.13%   | 1,912,795 | 3.81%   | 1,798,971 | 1,842,534 |\n\n#### **Distribution according to the origin of electrical energy (kWh)**\n\n| Renewable kWh     | 2,023     | % of total | 2022*     | % of total | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches          | 978,404   | 90.42%     | 820,684   | 72.37%     | 834,785   | 131,172   |\n| Head office       | 827,257   | 98.27%     | 666,933   | 92.91%     | 564,984   | 599,867   |\n| Total Spain       | 1,805,661 | 93.86%     | 1,487,617 | 82.85%     | 1,399,769 | 731,039   |\n| International     | 2,043     | 1.25%      | 0         | 0.00%      | 0         | 0         |\n| Total             | 1,807,704 | 86.60%     | 1,487,617 | 77.77%     | 1,399,769 | 731,039   |\n| NON-renewable kWh | 2,023     | % of total | 2022*     | % of total | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n| Branches          | 103,613   | 9.58%      | 313,394   | 27.63%     | 287,959   | 1,042,507 |\n| Head office       | 14,531    | 1.73%      | 50,902    | 7.09%      | 50,902    | 46,805    |\n| Total Spain       | 118,144   | 6.14%      | 313,861   | 17.42%     | 338,861   | 1,089,312 |\n| International     | 161,524   | 98.75%     | 60,341    | 100.00%    | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total             | 279,668   | 13.40%     | 425,178   | 22.23%     | 399,202   | 1,111,495 |\n| tCO2 emitted      | 2,023     | %          | 2022*     | %          | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n| Branches          | 28.04     | -67.05%    | 85.11     | 51.57%     | 56.15     | 204.90    |\n| Head office       | 3.95      | -71.46%    | 13.84     | 39.43%     | 9.93      | 12.08     |\n| Total Spain       | 31.99     | -67.67%    | 98.95     | -54.50%    | 66.08     | 216.98    |\n| International     | 40.06     | 270.72%    | 10.81     | -8.20%     | 11.77     | 5.04      |\n| Total             | 72.05     | -34.35%    | 109.76    | 40.99%     | 77.85     | 222.02    |\n\nIn the international network, Luxembourg has also transferred its contracts to renewable energy sources, so in 2023 the emissions of CO2 for this international headquarters was 0 tCO2eq.\n\nThere have been no changes in the Latin American network in this regard. The 2023 electricity consumption of 161,524 kWh resulted in an emission of 40.06 tCO2eq, an increase compared to the 10.81 tCO2eq reported in 2022, due to the fact that the electricity consumption of the Chilean office could not be measured in 2022. If we did not take this into account, emissions would be 11.23 tCO2eq, 3.7% more than the previous year.\n\nConsidering the total consumption of electricity of Renta 4 in 2023 (2,087,372 kWh), consumption from renewable energy sources (1,807,704 kWh) represents 86.60% of the total consumed, and the CO2 emissions in the year were 72.05 tCO2eq, a decrease of 34.35% compared to 2022.\n\n#### *\\*Corrections of the 2022 Measurement Model*\n\nThe differences detected in the calculation used in 2022 are due to the fact that the figure used in the 2022 report was based on an approximation model that did not yet use the carbon footprint calculation model developed and applied for the sustainability report submitted in may 2023. This calculation is carried out in accordance with GHG Protocol and MITECO instructions. In addition, with regard to the consumption figures for 2023, an assessment was carried out to specifically consider the electricity consumption carried out in 2023. As a result of this assessment, the electricity consumption that was carried out in 2022 but that was billed in 2023 has been identified. This 2022 consumption has been included in the consumption data that were calculated in 2022 for adjustment. In\n\nuarters at national level was 1,923,805 kWh (as indicated\nrepresented 80.2% of the total. In this context, a total of\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\naddition, the emission factors for Luxembourg, Colombia, Chile and Peru obtained from their respective official sources have been adjusted.\n\n## *Towards a 100% Sustainable Energy Consumption, With 0% Ghg Emissions*\n\nAs indicated in the plan that was included in the 2022 Report, in early 2023 the company ALPE ENERGY was hired to avoid these possible changes in the electricity generation policy of the suppliers and to be able to guarantee an agile and immediate reaction in the renegotiation. A necessary partnership to achieve the goal of 100% sustainable energy consumption. This objective is part of the SDG established for decarbonisation of the entity by operational activity in 2025 and aligned with the accession to NZBA.\n\nTwo important milestones in this process were achieved in 2023:\n\n**The first milestone achieved is that, since April 2023, 100% of the energy consumed by all the activity of Renta 4 in Spain (headquarters and office network) has been of sustainable origin. That is, we emit 0 Tn of CO2.** \n\nSimilarly, the Luxembourg office has also achieved 0 emissions since January.\n\nThis positive effect on renewable energy consumption in Spain and Luxembourg is very significant since the effort to neutralise CO2 emissions is not the result of offsetting, but by directly not generating emissions.\n\nTo achieve this milestone, we must add that, at the beginning of the year, certain energy distribution companies switched their generation to a mix combined with other energy sources. Renta 4 reacted immediately and, together with ALPE ENERGY, contracts were renegotiated to recover electricity generation from renewable energy sources as soon as possible.\n\nWith regard to emissions generated by Scope 2 throughout the year, GHG neutrality has been achieved in the national territory and Luxembourg. The objective is to focus now on Latin America to achieve the same results as soon as possible.\n\n#### **5.3. Scope 3 emissions – by indirect emissions (rest)**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group calculates the scope 3 of the carbon footprint according to the GHG Protocol.\n\nIn this scope, the following sources of emissions should be considered:\n\n· Indirect operational emissions generated by\n\n- services provided by suppliers,\n\n- commuting of employees to work places,\n\n- and business travel;\n\n· Indirect financed emissions, which in turn are also classified into\n\n- direct\n\n- indirect.\n\n#### *a. Indirect Operational Emissions*\n\nIndirect operational emissions increased by 6.38% from 803.13 tCO2eq in 2022 to 854.32 tCO2eq in 2023. Employee mobility has not changed significantly, growing by only 9.07%. The largest variations were the growth in business travel emissions (+74.23%), and the fall in emissions from contracting goods and services to suppliers (-34.14%).\n\n| Indirect operational emissions (tCO₂eq) | 2022   | 2023   | Var (%) | % of total |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|------------|\n| 1. Emissions from service providers     | 303.27 | 199.74 | -34.14% | 23.38%     |\n| 2. Employee mobility emissions          | 331.87 | 361.98 | 9.07%   | 42.37%     |\n| 3. Business travel emissions            | 167.99 | 292.68 | 74.23%  | 34.26%     |\n| Total                                   | 803.13 | 854.32 | 6.38%   |            |\n\nBelow, we will describe in detail each of the categories of operational indirect emissions to better understand the causes of their variation, as well as the calculation methods and estimates applied for each case.\n\n#### 1. Indirect Operational Emissions from Service Providers\n\nThe footprint for the acquisition of goods and services decreased between 2022 and 2023 both in absolute terms (- 34%) and in relative terms compared to each million euro of expenditure in the year for supplies of goods and services (- 32%). In 2022, total emissions from purchases of goods and services amounted to 303.27 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, while in 2023 they amounted to 199.74 tons of CO2 eq.\n\nEmissions related to supply expenditure decreased from 3.72 tons per million euro expenditure in 2022 to 2.52 tons per million euro expenditure in 2023.\n\nIt should be noted that the figures indicated for emissions and invoicing of 2022 suppliers were adjusted in 2024, so they are different from those indicated in the Sustainability Report published in May 2023 (compared to 2022 data). This adjustment has consisted in eliminating from the total invoicing of suppliers directed to Renta 4 those invoices that included items not related to the acquisition of goods and services (in particular, invoices related to commissions not related to the development of the Renta 4 activity). This approach will be maintained in the future.\n\n#### **Scope 3 – Operational Indirect Emissions by Suppliers, Classified by Sector**\n\n| Sector                                                             | Suppliers | (t CO₂eq) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 2         | 31.35     |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 2         | 34.62     |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 2         | 1.42      |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 1         | 4.32      |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24        | 20.89     |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 49        | 78.22     |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 3         | 8.75      |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 10        | 12.89     |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 5         | 6.42      |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1         | 0.84      |\n| Total                                                              | 99        | 199.74    |\n\n| Sector                                                             | Suppliers | (t CO₂ |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 2         | 31.3   |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 2         | 34.6   |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 2         | 1.4    |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 1         | 4.3    |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24        | 20.8   |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 49        | 78.2   |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 3         | 8.7    |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 10        | 12.8   |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 5         | 6.4    |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1         | 0.8    |\n| Total                                                              | 99        | 199.   |\n\nThe decrease in relative emissions from year to year is mainly due to:\n\n· A decrease in the number of suppliers analysed in manufacturing (2 in 2023 compared to 3 in 2022), with manufacturing being a highly polluting sector (more polluting than all sectors included in the calculation). While turnover in this sector has decreased by 47% due to a 33% reduction in the number of suppliers, absolute emissions in this sector have been reduced by 60%.\n\n· A decrease of 56% in absolute emissions in the construction sector, although there has been no decrease in the number of suppliers analysed (2) and the reduction in their turnover has been only 4%. This significant reduction in emissions from the construction sector is due to an improvement in data quality. All emissions for this sector have been calculated on the basis of sectoral data, information provided by the Eurostat database. Also, in line with the latest data update, emissions from the construction sector have been reduced by 44%.\n\n· Decrease of 48% of the absolute emissions of the sector of professional, scientific and technical activities considering that the reduction in the number of suppliers in this sector is equivalent to 38% and that the reduction in their turnover has been 37%.\n\n· Unlike 2022, no provider from the education sector has been included in the analysis, so emissions for this sector have been completely eliminated.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Scope 3 – Services and Acquired Goods | Absolute and Relative Emissions by Sector and Variation Compared to the Previous Year**\n\n|                                                                    | 2022                        | 2023   | '22vs'23      | 2022                                            | 2023   | '22vs23       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|\n| Sector                                                             | Absolute emissions (tCO2eq) |        | Variation (%) | Relative emissions<br>(kg CO2 eq / thousands €) |        | Variation (%) |\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 78.25                       | 31.35  | -59.93%       | 150.62                                          | 113.44 | -24.69%       |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 79.43                       | 34.62  | -56.41%       | 20.86                                           | 9.49   | -54.50%       |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 1.53                        | 1.42   | -7.50%        | 2.86                                            | 2.77   | -3.18%        |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 4.37                        | 4.32   | -1.06%        | 20.94                                           | 21.57  | 3.00%         |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24.36                       | 20.89  | -14.24%       | 3.56                                            | 2.50   | -29.72%       |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 68.6                        | 78.22  | 14.03%        | 1.1                                             | 1.28   | 16.60%        |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 2.1                         | 8.75   | 317.77%       | 9.71                                            | 13.02  | 34.13%        |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 24.73                       | 12.89  | -47.88%       | 4.39                                            | 3.63   | -17.30%       |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 6.71                        | 6.42   | -4.41%        | 6.48                                            | 6.71   | 7.73%         |\n| P – Education                                                      | 11.55                       | -      | -             | 90.28                                           | -      | -             |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1.63                        | 0.84   | -48.51%       | 11.34                                           | 2.95   | -73.97%       |\n| Total                                                              | 303.27                      | 199.74 | -34.14%       | 3.72                                            | 2.52   | -32.26%       |\n\n#### *Calculation Method*\n\nGiven the still novel nature of these indicators, we consider it appropriate to describe the calculation method applied.\n\nFor indirect Scope 3 emissions, which result from services provided by suppliers, Renta 4 allocated a portion of the emissions of each supplier in proportion to the service received, out of the total services provided by the emitting company.\n\n· Therefore, the Scope 3 emissions related to the Renta 4 suppliers have been calculated using the information on the Scope Footprint 1 and 2 provided by the suppliers themselves or, failing that, estimated according to an average of emissions and billing by CNAE, following the hybrid method dictated by the GHG Protocol.\n\n· The sources of the average emissions and turnover by CNAE have been obtained from Eurostat, Bank of Spain, Sabi and Osiris.\n\nThroughout 2023 Renta 4 worked with more than 2,300 suppliers. For the calculation of the carbon footprint of this year, the same criterion applied in 2022 has been used to select those suppliers that impacted the most on the company's profit and loss account, thus choosing those suppliers that invoiced Renta 4 more than €100,000 in 2023.\n\nFollowing the choice of this criterion, a total of 99 suppliers (compared to 98 in 2022) representing 86% of total expenditure on Renta 4 supplies in 2023 (compared to 75% covered in 2022) were analysed.\n\nOf these 99 suppliers, the multiplier was calculated for 53 of them on the basis of actual 2022 or earlier carbon footprint and turnover data published for 2023, 2022 or earlier based on data availability, while for the remaining 46, the carbon footprint by turnover was estimated according to the sector average.\n\nIt can be observed that the methodology is more accurate in relation to the total estimated emissions, in particular 43% of the emissions have been estimated based on the information of carbon footprint and billing of suppliers (compared to 27% in 2022). This difference is due to the availability of data when searching for information.\n\n## *2. Indirect Operational Emissions of Employee Mobility*\n\nThe carbon footprint due to the mobility of employees increased between 2022 and 2023 by 9.07%, from 331.88 to 361.98 tons of CO2 equivalent. In addition, regarding the tons of CO2 eq emitted by each employee, these increased from 0.524 in 2022 to 0.538 in 2023 (2.63%).\n\n|                                 | Adjusted results with estimates | 2022   | 2023   | Var (%) |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Emissions (t CO₂ eq)            |                                 | 331.88 | 361.98 | 9.07%   |\n| Emissions (t CO₂ eq / employee) |                                 | 0.524  | 0.538  | 3.05%   |\n\nThis difference is due in absolute terms to the increase in the total number of employees from 633 in 2022 to 670 in 2023, and in relative terms with respect to each employee to the fact that the main means of transport used by the employees is their own vehicle, where:\n\n· In general and within the category \"own vehicle\" the car is the medium that produces the most emissions as a whole (91% of the total emissions and 88% of the distance travelled by this category).\n\n· In 2023, gasoline-powered vehicles accounted for a higher percentage of the kilometres travelled by all own vehicles, 40.12%, compared to 36.57% in 2022, representing an increase of 9.71%. In addition, the emission factor for gasoline fuel cars (0.196 kg CO2/km) is higher than for diesel fuel (0.165 kg CO2/km).\n\nIn addition, the carbon footprint in relative terms with respect to each kilometre of travel made by employees on journeys from home to workplaces increased only by 10.62%, from 0.197 kilograms of CO2 eq/km to 0.218 kilograms of CO2 eq/km.\n\n| Carbon footprint per km travelled    | 2022  | 2023  | Var (%) |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Emissions (kg CO2 eq / km travelled) | 0.197 | 0.218 | 10.62%  |\n\n· This difference in emissions per kilometre of travel is due to the fact that employee travel patterns changed slightly between 2022 and 2023. Most employees continue to travel by car, which is the most polluting means of transport. The main difference between the two years is that in 2023 the proportion of kilometres taken by bus increased (from 6.90% to 9.35%), while the proportion of kilometres taken on foot or by bicycle (the least polluting means of transport) decreased (from 6.12% to 5.68%).\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Results of the Mobility Survey and its Corresponding Carbon Footprint*\n\nGross results of the survey, that is, exclusively on those answers considered valid, without applying the estimates for the entire organisation.\n\n| Means of transport          | Distance travelled |        | Emission factor (kg CO₂eq/km) | Emissions |        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n|                             | km                 | %      |                               | tCO₂eq    | %      |\n| Walking, bicycle or scooter | 80,200             | 5.68%  | -                             | 0         | 0%     |\n| Metro/train                 | 288,474            | 20.43% | 0.03*                         | 18.36     | 5.96%  |\n| Bus                         | 131,986            | 9.35%  | 0.05*                         | 19.02     | 6.18%  |\n| Own vehicle                 | 911,055            | 64.54% | Variable                      | 270.57    | 87.86% |\n| Car                         | 797,427            | 56.49% |                               | 245.29    | 79.65% |\n| Motorcycle                  | 113,628            | 8.05%  |                               | 25.28     | 8.21%  |\n| Total                       | 1,411,716          | 100%   | -                             | 307.95    | 100%   |\n| *Figures for Spain          |                    |        |                               |           |        |\n\n#### *Results of the Mobility Survey According to use of Means of Transport*\n\n· The means of transport most chosen by Renta 4 workers, specifically by 56% (317 of the workers surveyed), is their own vehicle.\n\n· 4% (23 workers) of those who choose this option, in addition to the private vehicle, use public transport.\n\n· 11% of workers (37 workers) who come to their jobs in private vehicles share a vehicle with one or more people.\n\n· 19% are exclusively on foot or by bicycle (106 of the employees surveyed).\n\n· The least chosen transportation is the bus, by 12% of the workers (69 of the employees surveyed).\n\n|                             | % employees per transport means out of total employees |        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Means of transport          | 2022                                                   | 2023   |\n| Walking, bicycle or scooter | 35.52%                                                 | 41.75% |\n| Metro/train                 | 17.16%                                                 | 20.18% |\n| Bus                         | 10.30%                                                 | 12.11% |\n| Car                         | 36.72%                                                 | 42.98% |\n| Motorcycle                  | 35.52%                                                 | 12.63% |\n\n#### Calculation Method\n\nGiven the still novel nature of these indicators, we consider it appropriate to describe the calculation method applied.\n\nFor the commuting from home to workplace of employees of Renta 4, whose offices are located in Spain, the average emission factors for each type of vehicle considered per kilometre travelled, published by MITECO and IDAE were used (Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving). For Chile, Colombia, Peru and Luxembourg, emission factors published by the relevant ministries of each country were used, provided that available and reliable emission factors could be found. Alternatively, for cases where information was not available, the same factors as Spain or those published by the Government of the United Kingdom were used in their absence.\n\nA total of 570 valid responses and 55 invalid questionnaire responses were received from a total of 670 employees who were part of the company at the end of 2023. For the 47 employees who did not respond or whose answers were not validated (55), their activity data and associated emissions have been estimated using the average consumption of the valid answers. It should be noted that the percentage of employee participation in the survey increased significantly from 2022 to 2023, 63.2% to 92.9%\n\n#### *3. Indirect Operational Emissions from Business Travel*\n\nIn 2023 business travel emissions increased by 74.23% from 167.99 tCO2eq in 2022 to 292.68 tCO2 eq in 2023.\n\n| Means of transport (tCO2eq) | 2022   | 2023   | Variation '22-'23 (%) |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Air travel                  | 164.05 | 288.99 | 76.17%                |\n| Train                       | 3.94   | 3.59   | -8.64%                |\n| Taxi                        |        | 0.002  | -                     |\n| Bus                         |        | 0.082  | -                     |\n| Total                       | 167.99 | 292.68 | 74.23%                |\n\nThis is mainly due to:\n\n· An 8% increase in the number of trips made compared to 2022 (749 trips in 2023, compared with 693 trips in 2022).\n\n· Above all, however, there was a 14% increase in the number of air travel compared to 2022 (400 trips in 2023, compared with 351 trips in 2022). Air travel accounts for 87.64% of the kilometres travelled and 98.74% of total emissions. This is therefore the main emission factor in the category of business travel.\n\n· And there is a corresponding increase of 17% in the number of kilometres travelled compared to 2022 (826,304 km in 2023, compared to 705,474 km in 2022).\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is interesting to note that the emissions relating to train travel have reduced by 9% since fewer trips have been made and fewer kilometres travelled in this means of transport (reduction of 9%, from 110,981 km in 2022 to 101,465 km in 2023).\n\n| Means of<br>transport | Distance (km) | Emission factor<br>(kg CO₂eq/km) | Emissions<br>(t CO₂eq) | Distance (%) | Emissions (%) |\n|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Train                 | 101,465       | 0.035                            | 3.6                    | 12.28%       | 1.23%         |\n| Air travel            | 724,133       | Variable                         | 289                    | 87.64%       | 98.74%        |\n| Bus                   | 690           | 0.118                            | 0.08                   | 0.08%        | 0.03%         |\n| Taxi                  | 15.80         | 0.149                            | 0                      | 0.00%        | 0.00%         |\n| Total                 | 826,303       | -                                | 292.68                 | 100%         | 100%          |\n\n# Calculation Method\n\nBusiness trips relate to journeys made by workers for work reasons (meetings, office visits, etc.) either by plane, train, bus or taxi. It should be noted that these last two means of transport (bus and taxi) have been included in the calculation of the carbon footprint of Scope 3 with regard to business trips in 2023, although they were not included in the calculation of 2022 due to the unavailability of data. With regard to these means of transport, both the distance travelled and the emissions of CO2 are negligible.\n\nEmission factors published by the British Government in June 2023 have been used for the calculations of emissions from business travel.\n\nThe activity data have been collected from the distances travelled in the aforementioned means of transport for the year 2023 thanks to the information provided by the travel agency that Renta 4 uses (Agencias de Viajes Marine S.L.).\n\n# *b. Financed Indirect Emissions*\n\nAs for the Scope 3 of the carbon footprint derived from financed emissions of the Renta Group 4, it comes from the following exposures:\n\n· Direct financed emissions: These are those exposures that involve financing to counterparties through their exposure in the Group's own portfolio, mainly through the acquisition and maintenance on the balance sheet of debt securities and equity instruments.\n\n· Indirect financed emissions: These are those exposures that involve counterparty financing derived from financial guarantees that support credit and guarantee transactions. For this purpose, financial guarantees are made up of liquid financial instruments pledged as security for financing operations. The financial guarantees are considered to indirectly guarantee the exposure to the carbon footprint of the creditor in the proportion that they respectively cover the amount provided in the loans.\n\nThe assets considered from Scope 3 - financed emissions of Renta 4 are as follows:\n\n· Corporate Finance (investment in instruments that finance companies) by direct investment in companies in equity or debt\n\n· Sovereign bonds (investment in fixed income from countries' debt)\n\n· Indirect investment through CII (Collective Investment Institutions)\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to the financed emissions of Renta 4 considering Scope 1, 2 and 3 decreased in absolute terms between 2022 and 2023 from 211,480 tCO2eq to 122,862 tCO2 eq(-42%).\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to Scope 3 of financed emissions taking into account emissions of Scope 1, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested, reduced by 12%, going from 174.4 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 153.3 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023. Also, if we consider only the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the companies in which it is invested, the reduction remains at 12% (from 170.8 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 149.5 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023).\n\n**This decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms is mainly due to the fact that for this year the Renta 4 Portfolio changed considerably, which significantly reduced its investments in sovereign bonds, these being the main component of the carbon footprint of the company's financed emissions.**\n\n|                      | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO₂eq ) |            | Var    | t CO₂eq/M€ |        | Var    |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|--------|\n|                      | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022                | 2023       | (%)    | 2022       | 2023   | (%)    |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3) | 309                | 329   | 95.59       | 25.6   | 7,155.80            | 4,738.88   | -33.8% | 74.86      | 185.14 | 147.3% |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2)    | 309                | 317   | 95.59       | 20.59  | 2,801.19            | 914.87     | -67.3% | 29.31      | 44.42  | 51.6%  |\n| Sovereign bonds*     | 31                 | 29    | 1,050.14    | 661.37 | 200,405.42          | 116,142.07 | -42.0% | 190.84     | 175.61 | -8.0%  |\n| CIIs                 | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22            | 1,981.18   | -49.4% | 58.32      | 17.3   | -70.3% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2-S3)  | 1,969              | 1,631 | 1,212.93    | 801.46 | 211,480.44          | 122,862.12 | -41.9% | 174.35     | 153.3  | -12.1% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2)     | 1,969              | 1,619 | 1,212.93    | 796.46 | 207,125.83          | 119,038.11 | -42.5% | 170.76     | 149.46 | -12.5% |\n\n\\*Consumption emissions excluding the LULUCF sector\n\nRegarding the carbon footprint in relative terms this is due to the decrease in the carbon footprint regarding investments in sovereign bonds and CIIs. In relation to sovereign bonds, the decrease is due to the fact that unlike 2022, in 2023 Renta 4 did not invest in German public debt (this being the country that issued the most in its sovereign bond portfolio). In addition, in relation to collective investment institutions the decrease could be due to a variation (probably improvement) in the quality of the fund footprint data provided by Clarity, so the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the funds in which it has been invested decreased.\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/2 description: The image shows a green icon of a factory next to a building with three horizontal lines on it.

In particular, 1,969 investments included in the calculation of 2022 for a total amount of €1,213 million to the inclusion of 1,676 investments for an amount of €802 million in 2023.\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to Scope 3 of financed emissions taking into account Scope 1 emissions, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested and considering the same sectors as in the calculation of 2022 decreased by 12% going from 174.4 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 153.6 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023.\n\nTherefore, whether we consider the same sectors that were included in the 2022 calculation or consider those recommended by the PCAF reporting standard for the funded emissions related to Scope 1, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested, the results are similar.\n\n|                        | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO₂eq) |            | Var     | t CO₂eq/M€ |        | Var     |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|--------------------|------------|---------|------------|--------|---------|\n|                        | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022               | 2023       | (%)     | 2022       | 2023   | (%)     |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3\"\") | 309                | 374   | 95.59       | 25.91  | 7,155.80           | 4,993.98   | -30.21% | 74.86      | 192.77 | 157.51% |\n| Sovereign bonds*       | 31                 | 29    | 1,050.14    | 661.37 | 200,405.42         | 116,142.07 | -42.05% | 190.84     | 175.61 | -7.98%  |\n| CIIs                   | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22           | 1,981.18   | -49.45% | 58.32      | 17.3   | -70.34% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2-S3\"\")  | 1,969              | 1,676 | 1,212.93    | 801.77 | 211,480.44         | 123,117.23 | -41.78% | 174.35     | 153.55 | -11.93% |\n|                        | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO2eq) |            |         | t CO2eq/M€ |        |         |\n|                        | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022               | 2023       | Var %   | 2022       | 2023   | Var %   |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3)   | 309                | 329   | 95.59       | 25.6   | 7,155.80           | 4,738.88   | -33.8%  | 74.86      | 185.14 | 147.3%  |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2)      | 309                | 317   | 95.59       | 20.59  | 2,801.19           | 914.87     | -67.3%  | 29.31      | 44.42  | 51.6%   |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S34F) | 309                | 374   | 95.59       | 25.91  | 7,155.80           | 4,993.98   | -30.2%  | 74.86      | 192.77 | 157.5%  |\n\n\\*Consumption emissions excluding the LULUCF sector\n\nNext, we will analyse in detail each of the different types of Scope 3 financed emissions\n\n## *1. Corporate Finance – Direct Investment in Equity or Debt Companies*\n\nIncluding Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which it is invested considering the most polluting sectors and those defined by the PCAF (see calculation method below):\n\n· In 2023, 329 investments in companies through shares or bonds were considered (+20 compared to 2022) for a total of 25.6 million euros (-70 M€ compared to 2022). This decrease in data analysed has been reflected in a decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms that decreased by 34%, accumulating an emissions total of 4,738.88 tCO2eq in 2023. However, it should be noted that in relative terms the carbon footprint increased by 147% from 75 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 185 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023. The significance of this increase is due to the wide variety of methodologies applied by investment companies for the calculation of Scope 3 emissions.\n\nIncluding Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which it is invested considering the same sectors as in 2022:\n\n· In 2023, 374 investments in companies through shares or bonds were considered (+65 compared to 2022) for a total of 25.9 million euros (-70 M€ compared to 2022). In total, the investments of 69 different NACE codes have been analysed, 11 more than the analysis of 2022. This decrease in data analysed considering the total amount of investments has been reflected in a decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms that decreased by 30.2%, accumulating an emissions total of 4,993.98 tCO2 eq in 2023. However, it should be noted that in relative terms the carbon footprint increased by 157% from 75 tCO2 eq/M€ invested in 2022 to 192.77 tCO2 eq/M€ invested in 2023. The significance of this increase is due to the wide variety in the methodology applied by the invested companies to calculate their Scope 3 emissions.\n\n# *2. Corporate Finance – Indirect Investment Through Collective Investment Institutions*\n\nThe amount invested in CIIs, mainly in funds, has increased substantially from year to year, however, carbon footprint values have decreased significantly. In the last year, the proportion of funds analysed fell, from covering 51% (1,629 investments) of total investments in 2022 to 46% (1,273 investments) of total investments in 2023 (-22%).\n\nOn the other hand, the amount invested considered increased from €67 million in 2022 to €114 million in 2023. Despite this increase in the amount invested, absolute emissions decreased from 3,919 t CO2 eq in 2022 to 1,981 t CO2 eq in 2023 (-49%). In addition, relative emissions decreased by 70% from 58 tCO2eq /M€ in 2022 to 17 tCO2eq /M€ in 2023.\n\nIn short, in this year more investment has been made in collective investment institutions, obtaining a lower footprint in both absolute and relative terms. The explanation for this phenomenon lies in the decrease in CII carbon footprint figures provided by Clarity AI and it is likely that this is due to an improvement in the quality of information available in the database.\n\n|      | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | tCO₂eq   | Var      |      | t CO₂eq/M€ | Var   |      |\n|------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|------|------------|-------|------|\n|      | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022     | 2023     | (%)  | 2022       | 2023  | (%)  |\n| CIIs | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22 | 1,981.18 | -49% | 58.32      | 17.30 | -70% |\n\n<sup>5</sup>Scope 3 considering the same sectors as in the calculation of 2022\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *3. Emissions Financed by Sovereign Bonds*\n\nFor the purposes of comparison of the results of sovereign emissions between one year and another, emissions by consumption are taken as a reference excluding the LULUCF sector, because based on the indications and recommendations of the PCAF this type of emission would reflect a more accurate picture regarding investment in sovereign bonds.\n\nThis category of investment decreased by 37% between 2022 and the end of 2023. Investment in sovereign debt accounted for 87% of the investment analysed and 95% of the financed emissions in 2022 for the respective amounts of 1,050 M€ and 200,405 tCO2eq. At the end of 2023, the investment of Renta 4 in these assets was €661 million representing 83% of the investment and the associated emissions were 116,142 tCO2eq representing 95% of the total financed emissions of 2023.\n\n#### **GHG Emissions Comparison Excluding LULUCF Sectors (PCAF Recommendation)**\n\n|                           | Including sectors<br>LULUCF (t CO₂eq) |            |        | Excluding sectors<br>LULUCF (t CO₂eq) |            |        |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|\n| Sovereign emissions       | 2022                                  | 2023       | (%)    | 2022                                  | 2023       | (%)    |\n| Emissions per production  | 153,431.90                            | 91,302.50  | -40.5% | 169,326.59                            | 97,912.71  | -42.2% |\n| Emissions per consumption | 184,517.33                            | 109,531.86 | -41.6% | 200,405.42                            | 116,142.07 | -42.1% |\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n#### **Distribution of Sovereign Bond Investment by Country**\n\n|          | Investment (M€) | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany  |                 | 2.34%  | -      |\n| Spain    |                 | 15.17% | 0.18%  |\n| Italy    |                 | 80.04% | 95.86% |\n| Portugal |                 | 2.45%  | 3.96%  |\n\nAs regards emissions relative to tons of CO2 eq. emitted for every million euro invested, a reduction of 8% is observed if we consider the emissions by consumption excluding LULUCF. This reduction is due to the fact that, unlike 2022, in 2023 there was no investment in German public debt (only in Spain, Italy and Portugal), with Germany being the most polluting country of these four. In addition, the proportion of investment in Spanish public debt in 2023 was significantly reduced compared to 2022, this being the second most polluting country of the four considered.\n\n#### **Comparative Table GHG/M€ Emissions Excluding LULUCF Sectors (PCAF Recommendation)**\n\n| Sovereign emissions       | Including LULUCF sectors<br>(t CO₂eq/M€) |        |  | Var    | Excluding LULUCF sectors<br>(t CO₂eq/M€) |        |  | Var    |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|--|--------|------------------------------------------|--------|--|--------|\n|                           | 2022                                     | 2023   |  | (%)    | 2022                                     | 2023   |  | (%)    |\n| Emissions per production  | 146.11                                   | 138.05 |  | -5.51% | 161.24                                   | 148.04 |  | -8.19% |\n| Emissions per consumption | 175.71                                   | 165.61 |  | -5.75% | 190.84                                   | 175.61 |  | -7.98% |\n\n#### *Calculation Method – Considerations*\n\nAs reflected throughout this Scope 3 - funded indirect emissions section, a number of changes in the calculation methodology described below have been implemented.\n\n**In line with the recommendations of the PCAF standard for the calculation of emissions related to investment in quoted CF, the following has been included for consideration:**\n\n· Scope 1 and 2 emissions from companies in which investment is made: As in the calculation of 2022, those assets that represented 70% of the investments in listed shares and corporate bonds have been selected and for the remaining 30% data have been sought for those assets belonging to highly polluting sectors.\n\n· Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which investment is made: In addition to considering assets representing 70% of investments, data have been sought for sectors that the PCAF standard specifies should be included.\n\nIn addition, we have also chosen to calculate the results based on the same methodology used in 2022 for its best comparison.\n\n**Calculation based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions of invested companies**\n\n# **Calculation based on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions of**\n\n**invested companies**\n\n| 2.

In particular, there have been 64 work losses, 49 of them voluntary, 77% of the total and 15 non-voluntary, representing 23%.\n\nIn 2023, 101 new employees were added, of whom 67 were men and 34 were women, 66% and 34% respectively, the details of which are shown in the following tables:\n\n## **New Employees by Geographical Area**\n\n| Geographical area   |                    | Men | Women | No. new<br>employees | %<br>Workforce |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-----|-------|----------------------|----------------|\n| International total |                    | 18  | 11    | 29                   | 29%            |\n| National territory  | Central            | 42  | 16    | 58                   | 81%            |\n|                     | Commercial network | 7   | 7     | 14                   | 19%            |\n| National total      |                    | 49  | 23    | 72                   | 71%            |\n| Total additions     |                    | 67  | 34    | 101                  |                |\n|                     |                    | 66% | 34%   |                      |                |\n\nIn terms of the distribution of new employees by geographical area, a total of 29 employees were added internationally, 29% of the total and 71% at the national level, i.e. 72 new professionals. 58 of them in the central services and 14 in the office network.\n\n#### **New Additions by Category**\n\n| Category       | Men | Women | No. new employees | % Workforce |\n|----------------|-----|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Management     | 1   |       | 1                 | 1%          |\n| Technical      | 63  | 31    | 94                | 93%         |\n| Administrative | 3   | 3     | 6                 | 6%          |\n| TOTAL          | 67  | 34    | 101               |             |\n|                | 66% | 34%   |                   |             |\n\n#### **New Additions by Age**\n\n| Age bracket | Men | Women | No. new employees | % Workforce |\n|-------------|-----|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| <30         | 29  | 16    | 45                | 45%         |\n| [30-40]     | 23  | 6     | 29                | 29%         |\n| [40-50]     | 6   | 9     | 15                | 15%         |\n| >50         | 9   | 3     | 12                | 12%         |\n| TOTAL       | 67  | 34    | 101               |             |\n\nIt should be noted that 45% of new entrants, 45 employees are under the age of 30 and 29 are between the ages of 30 and 40, i.e. 74 under the age of 40 have been added, and this allows Renta 4 to reduce the average age of the workforce and incorporate young professionals with new proposals and visions. On the other hand, it should be noted that during 2023 12 employees over 50 years of age have been added, providing experience and knowledge. This generational diversity brings enrichment to the organisation.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to the type of recruitment, it should be noted that as of December 31, 2023, 99.7% of employees have a permanent employment relationship, if we include the two (2) temporary contracts arising from the partial retirement of two employees prior to their official retirement.\n\nThis level of permanent hiring has been maintained since its inception, thus complying with one of the fundamental principles established in the Renta 4 HR policy, job security. Renta 4 considers that, if employees have a permanent, secure employment relationship in which they can develop their professional career in the long term, they can acquire and gain extensive knowledge in investment products and services, and that this will guarantee the quality of advice on the banking service provided to customers, promoting another fundamental value for Renta 4, which is trust and a close relationship with its customers.\n\nIn addition, permanent employment allows the attraction and retention of talent, maintaining low levels of turnover.\n\nThe types of contracts, classified by gender, age and professional categories for 2023 and 2022, both at the end of the financial years and average number, are shown below:\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Gender**\n\n| Type of Contract         |     | 2023  |       |         |     |       | 2022  |         |  |  |\n|--------------------------|-----|-------|-------|---------|-----|-------|-------|---------|--|--|\n|                          | Men | Women | Total | % Total | Men | Women | Total | % Total |  |  |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 444 | 212   | 656   | 97.9%   | 418 | 199   | 617   | 97.5%   |  |  |\n| Permanent empl. contract |     | 10    | 10    | 1.5%    |     | 11    | 11    | 1.7%    |  |  |\n| Temporary empl. contract | 2   |       | 2     | 0.3%    |     | 2     | 2     | 0.3%    |  |  |\n| Temporary empl. contract | 1   | 1     | 2     | 0.3%    | 2   | 1     | 3     | 0.5%    |  |  |\n| Total                    | 447 | 223   | 670   | 100.0%  | 420 | 213   | 633   | 100.0%  |  |  |\n| % Total                  | 67% | 33%   |       |         | 66% | 34%   |       |         |  |  |\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Category**\n\n|                          | 2023       |           |                |       | 2022       |           |                |       |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|\n| Type of Contract         | Management | Technical | Administrative | Total | Management | Technical | Administrative | Total |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 13         | 599       | 44             | 656   | 13         | 537       | 67             | 617   |\n| Permanent empl. contract |            | 4         | 6              | 10    |            | 4         | 7              | 11    |\n| Temporary empl. contract |            | 2         |                | 2     |            | 1         | 1              | 2     |\n| Temporary empl. contract |            | 1         | 1              | 2     |            | 1         | 2              | 3     |\n| Total                    | 13         | 606       | 51             | 670   | 13         | 543       | 77             | 633   |\n| % Total                  | 2%         | 90%       | 8%             |       | 2%         | 86%       | 12%            |       |\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Age**\n\n| Type of contract<br>according to age range | 2023 |         |         |     | 2022  |     |         |         |     |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|---------|---------|-----|-------|-----|---------|---------|-----|-------|\n|                                            | <30  | [30-40] | [40-50] | >50 | TOTAL | <30 | [30-40] | [40-50] | >50 | TOTAL |\n| Permanent empl. contract                   | 108  | 166     | 231     | 151 | 656   | 104 | 170     | 210     | 133 | 617   |\n| Permanent empl. contract                   | 2    | 2       | 1       | 5   | 10    |     | 5       | 3       | 3   | 11    |\n| Temporary empl. contract                   | 1    |         | 1       |     | 2     | 1   |         | 1       |     | 2     |\n| Temporary empl. contract                   |      |         |         | 2   | 2     |     |         |         | 3   | 3     |\n| Total                                      | 111  | 168     | 233     | 158 | 670   | 105 | 175     | 214     | 139 | 633   |\n| % Total                                    | 17%  | 25%     | 35%     | 24% |       | 17% | 28%     | 34%     | 22% |       |\n\n#### **Average Number of Contracts at 31-12-2023 by Gender**\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n|                          | Gender |        |        |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Type of Contract         | Men    | Women  | TOTAL  |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 435.25 | 202.75 | 638    |\n| Permanent empl. contract | -

losses, as it is established as it should be included in this SNFI, this being a low turnover level and considered \"healthy\" in organisations.\n\nOn this point, we would also like to highlight that Renta 4 did not make any temporary lay-offs or dismissals during 2023.\n\n## **2. Talent selection**\n\nIn line with Renta 4's HR policy, Renta 4's recruitment process is based on recruiting professionals with a high level of qualifications, training and experience appropriate to each position, assessing the suitability of each candidate, their training and professional merits, thus ensuring the selection of the best professionals in the sector, in order to provide specialised, high-quality banking services.\n\nThis selection policy has as one of its fundamental principles the recruitment of candidates based on the suitability of the candidate to the position, promoting the selection of the best qualified professionals and those who have the best competences for each position, regardless of gender and not associating the skills required with gender, but with the worth of each professional and their suitability for the position.\n\nJobs are defined by focusing on the concrete definition of functions and tasks, aspects and technical knowledge, as well as skills and competencies appropriate for their performance. The model to be followed when defining the posts is:\n\n· Defining the job position and professional profile in a neutral way, avoiding associating skills with gender, always identifying them as professional competences and not as innate personal skills.\n\n· Description of the job requirements and professional profiles of the candidates associated with the posts, being as precise as possible and adjusted to the real needs of the post.\n\n· To assess experience and other job-specific competencies.\n\nIn the selection processes, different sources of recruitment are used, on the one hand, platforms and social networks such as LinkedIn, Infojobs, etc., focused on the selection of professionals, these being channels that allow companies to post job offers, access candidate databases and thus select professionals that fit the profiles and requirements of the positions. Other sources of recruitment used by Renta 4 are applications received through the\n\nvarious online channels of the entity (corporate website, mail, etc.), universities and internal promotion.\n\nIn this sense, the selection processes are carried out mainly internally by the HR department of Renta 4 and only in those processes in which there is a high technical level or complexity when accessing certain types of profiles, the selection process is outsourced to companies specialising in recruitment consulting, although Renta 4 actively participates in all phases of the selection process.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, a total of 71 selection processes were carried out internally, to fill 44 positions each with specific requirements, all of them to fill vacancies that had occurred as a result of the employees' departures due to the turnover of staff and in other cases to fill newly-created posts or as an addition to various departments and areas.\n\nIn these processes, a total of 519 candidates were selected, representing an average of 7 candidates per process, 402 of them male, 77% and 117 women, 23% of the candidates. Of these, a total of 285 professionals were interviewed, 216 men (76%) and 67 women (24%), and a total of 65 professionals were employed, of which 43 were men, 66% and 22 women, 34%.\n\nIt should be noted that, although Renta 4 applies equal criteria in the selection processes, selecting candidates who meet the specific requirements of the positions, regardless of gender, in recent years, in the selection processes, it has established the criterion of including a percentage of at least 50% of female candidates. However, in many of the selection processes, the number of female candidates who register in the job offers published by Renta 4 is less than 50% of all candidates or women candidates do not meet the requirements of the post, and this makes participation in the selection processes difficult for a larger number of female candidates and therefore difficult to recruit them.\n\nAlso, in relation to other sources of recruitment, Renta 4 has been collaborating with universities for many years, considering that training is a fundamental pillar in the field of HR. For this reason, \n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 maintains collaboration agreements with most universities throughout the country, as well as some international universities, in the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Annually, Renta 4 provides training internships in different departments, areas and offices of the entity, in which students carry out a period of curricular or extracurricular internships, in which they learn among other topics about markets and different financial products, taxation, the procedures of the department or office in which they perform the internship, as well as how an investment bank operates.\n\nIn 2023 Renta 4 formalised a total of 69 internships, 22 of them in the offices of the commercial network and 47 internships in the central services, in different departments such as asset management, analysis, corporate, internal control, etc. and with an average duration of between three (3) and six (6) months.\n\nIt should be noted that for those students who perform well during the internship period, their curriculum is added to the database of possible candidates, participating in the selection processes of positions that may arise, with internships being another of the sources of recruitment that Renta 4 uses for the selection of candidates in the selection processes.\n\n#### **3. Remuneration**\n\nThe Remuneration Policy seeks to establish a remuneration scheme appropriate to the engagement and responsibility undertaken by the people to whom it applies, with the aim, first, of attracting, retaining and motivating the most outstanding professionals and, second, helping the company to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries out its activity.\n\nThis policy is based, inter alia, on the following principles:\n\n· It will be compatible with the company's long-term business strategy, objectives, values and interests.\n\n· The remuneration paid by the company in accordance with these principles follows criteria of moderation and proportionality to the group's results, and must encourage sound and effective risk management that prevents conflicts of interests.\n\n· Remuneration shall establish an appropriate balance between fixed and variable components.\n\n· The variable remuneration shall be determined by the achievement of objectives that are set periodically, not being linked to the assumption of high risks.\n\n· The objectives to be evaluated will be individual and strategic. The evaluation of the objectives, their degree of achievement and performance will be analysed annually. The payment of the variable remuneration will depend on the degree of achievement of the objectives set, adjusted to the results obtained by the entity.\n\n· The variable remuneration policy must be aligned with the company's results, being paid only if it is sustainable with the company's financial situation.\n\n· Said policy shall be compatible with appropriate and effective management of risk, and fosters such management in all circumstances, without offering, consequently, incentives for a assuming a level of risk that exceeds the level of risk accepted by the company.\n\nRenta 4's remuneration policy aims to attract and retain talent, incorporating highly-qualified professionals, applying remuneration levels in line with the market, depending, among other things, on the different job positions, level of responsibility, experience, qualifications and performance.\n\nThis remuneration policy is based, on the one hand, on criteria of equality and non-discrimination, pursuing pay equity, and on the other hand, on the individual evaluation of the performance of each employee, depending on the degree of achievement of objectives at individual and corporate level, therefore, based on the meritocracy and performance of each professional.\n\nLikewise, their salary levels seek internal equity within the company and external equity with the market, in order to be competitive and attractive wages, as a tool of attraction and retention, in order to have the best professionals in the sector, to offer a service of quality and excellence.\n\nAnnually Renta 4 carries out a performance evaluation in which the degree of achievement of the quantitative and/or qualitative objectives established, which aim to evaluate and align them with the strategic objectives of the company and professional development is analysed.\n\nIt should be noted that Renta 4 at all times rigorously applies the legal regulations in force in each of the countries in which it operates and is established. In this sense, in general terms, more than 95% of 4-income employees are at wage levels higher than the minimum wages established in the applicable conventions and/ or regulations.\n\nThis NFIR uses the same classification of professional categories as is used in the Annual Accounts containing the Group's financial information and in the various financial statements reported to the supervisors.\n\n#### **Average Remuneration**\n\nThe average remuneration of employees and its evolution is shown in the following tables according to geographical professional classification, gender and age:\n\n#### **Average Remuneration by Category and Geographical Area**\n\n| Average Remuneration6 -

International**\n\n#### **International**\n\nFirst, it is evident that there are large pay differences in the labour markets where Renta 4 carries out its activity and is established; that is, between Spain and the countries of Latin America; Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg, these not being comparable for different reasons. On the one hand, they are very heterogeneous labour markets, where there are great differences in salary levels, and on the other hand, at the organisational level there is a diversity and variety of jobs and therefore different professional profiles, with different types of roles, experience, responsibilities and seniority. All this together with the high levels of turnover that exist in the Latin American countries in which Renta 4 operates and the exchange rate applied in each year, makes them not comparable as remunerations.\n\nInternationally, as reflected in the average remuneration tables, in 2023, there was a 21% wage increase caused mainly by the increase in the workforce in Latin American countries, which was 19% and highlighting that the wage increase was higher in women's remuneration than in them men, thereby reducing the wage gap compared to 2022.\n\nIn contrast, at national level in 2023, the average total remuneration remained stable compared to 2022. In this regard, it should be noted that the total average remuneration includes both fixed and variable remuneration, not reflecting the variations produced in each type of remuneration. The following tables show separately the fixed and variable remuneration for the financial year 2023 and 2022, which shows that the change in average fixed wages was 4% nationally, while variable remuneration has been reduced by 23%, the average total remuneration has remained stable.\n\n#### **Fixed and Variable Remuneration, by Category and Geographical Area**\n\n| Fixed<br>remuneration *<br>-Category-Areas | 2023    | 2022    | Variation %<br>period | Variable<br>remuneration*<br>-Category-Areas | 2023    | 2022    | Variation %<br>period |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|\n| International                              | 34,307  | 29,014  | 18%                   | International                                | 16,769  | 12,694  | 32%                   |\n| Management                                 | 120,697 | 113,359 | 6%                    | Management                                   | 57,936  | 45,618  | 27%                   |\n| Technical                                  | 33,285  | 28,360  | 17%                   | Technical                                    | 16,747  | 13,003  | 29%                   |\n| Administrative                             | 16,513  | 11,547  | 43%                   | Administrative                               | 632     | 152     | 316%                  |\n| National                                   | 54,879  | 52,874  | 4%                    | National                                     | 6,042   | 7,837   | -23%                  |\n| Management                                 | 206,364 | 204,091 | 1%                    | Management                                   | 105,089 | 131,960 | -20%                  |\n| Technical                                  | 53,781  | 52,615  | 2%                    | Technical                                    | 4,432   | 5,946   | -25%                  |\n| Administrative                             | 31,162  | 30,854  | 1%                    | Administrative                               | 488     | 1,082   | -55%                  |\n| Total fixed<br>remuneration                | 52,146  | 49.858  | 5%                    | Total variable<br>remuneration               | 7.424   | 8.451   | -12%                  |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, there is a difference in the average remuneration nationally between men and women, specifically in the professional category of the Technical group, where the largest number of employees of the Group is concentrated, 90% of the staff, the reason for this difference being the wide variety of jobs that fall into this category, with different types of functions, responsibility, experience and seniority and, therefore, a wide range of remuneration.\n\n#### **Average Remuneration, by Category, Gender and Geographical Area**\n\n|                                          |         | 2023    |                               |         | 2022    |                               |     | Variation % Period 23/22 |  |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|-----|--------------------------|--|\n| Average Remuneration -<br>Category-Areas | Men     | Women   | Difference<br>Man vs<br>Woman | Men     | Women   | Difference<br>Man vs<br>Woman | M   | W                        |  |\n| International                            | 58,868  | 30,698  | 28,170                        | 48,266  | 23,281  | 24,985                        | 22% | 32%                      |  |\n| Management                               | 178,633 | -

For this reason, the following table shows only the average fixed remuneration for the financial years 2023 and 2022. This information shows that the differences in fixed wages between the two genders are smaller than the differences shown in total wages and highlights that the overall wage increase for women has been 5%, higher than 4% for men. Internationally, the increase in women's wages has been even greater, being 33% compared to 17% for men and at the national level it has been 5% for women compared to 3% for men.\n\n#### **Fixed Remuneration, by Category, Gender and Geographical Area**\n\n| Fixed remuneration -

Coupled with this, the wage evolution of employees in Renta 4, which depending on factors\n\nsuch as; the degree of demand for the job in the labour market, changes in roles and responsibilities, as well as the evaluation of the individual performance of each worker, has made it possible to generate different wage developments, without, therefore, there being wage discrimination between men and women.\n\nAt the international level, the exchange rate and the different salary levels and differences in the labour markets in each of the countries in which Renta 4 has an international presence have an additional influence, although in all of them, Renta 4 applies the regulations and salary levels in force in each of them.\n\nWith regard to the evolution and results of the wage gap for the financial year 2023, it should be noted that internationally it was reduced by 71%, going from 31% in 2022 to 8.9% in 2023 and nationally the wage gap decreased from 15.6% in 2022 to 10.3% in 2023, falling by 34%.\n\nSimilarly, the wage gap calculated on the basis of fixed remuneration alone has been reduced by 71% internationally and nationally by 39%.\n\n#### **Remuneration of Members of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe average remuneration in euros received in 2023 by the members of the Board of Directors of Renta 4 by gender is shown below:\n\n| Average remuneration       | 2023    |        |         | 2022    |        |         | Variation Average Remuneration<br>2023/2022 |       |       |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                            | Men     | Women  | Total   | Men     | Women  | Total   | Men                                         | Women | Total |\n| Executive Directors        | 379,250 | -      | 379,250 | 415,000 | -      | 415,000 | -8.6%                                       | -     | -8.6% |\n| Non-Executive Directors14  | 90,000  | 95,000 | 92,000  | 80,000  | 80,000 | 80,000  | 12.5%                                       | 18.8% | 15.0% |\n| Total average remuneration | 205,700 | 95,000 | 174,071 | 214,000 | 80,000 | 176,000 | -3.9%                                       | 18.8% | -1.1% |\n\nNon-executive Directors receive remuneration for their being on the Board and, in addition, those who in turn are members of the Board committees receive additional remuneration in this respect.\n\nThe remuneration established for directors is the same for all non-executive directors, regardless of gender.\n\nExecutive directors do not receive any remuneration for their status as directors, but the remuneration is linked and associated with their executive functions in Renta 4.\n\nexecutive directors who are members of one of the committees of the\n\n<sup>12</sup> Total remuneration includes fixed remuneration and variable remuneration\n\n<sup>13</sup> Total remuneration includes fixed remuneration and variable remuneration\n\n<sup>14</sup> Total remuneration is the remuneration as a member of the Board and additionally, those non-executive directors who are members of one of the committees of the board will receive an additional remuneration.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4. Training**\n\nAs indicated above, specialisation is another of the strategic values of Renta 4 and, therefore, another of the principles on which the HR Policy of Renta 4 is based is the high qualification of its employees.\n\nTo do this, training is one of the fundamental pillars, which allows professionals who form Renta 4 to have the knowledge of financial products and markets and provide customers with specialised and high quality advice, thus providing a differentiating value with other entities.\n\nThe digital environment and its constant transformation requires ongoing training to become a strategic tool, being a differentiating factor in the banking sector, allowing professionals to adapt to constant changes in products, markets, regulatory changes, etc. In addition, to be able to know the needs and aspirations of customers to offer personalised solutions, that add value and based on principles of sustainable investment.\n\nFor this reason, Renta 4 has an annual training plan that provides employees with the necessary technical knowledge, skills and competencies.\n\nIt should be noted that according to MiFID II regulations, professionals who advise and inform customers must have a certain level of qualification, and for this they must be duly certified. In this regard, at Renta 4 at 31 December 2023, 93% of the employees of the commercial network or who perform advisory functions to Renta 4 customers hold one of the qualifications considered valid by the CNMV to comply with said regulations.\n\nIn particular, 80% are in possession of the *European Financial Advisor (EFA),* European Financial Planner (EFP) and/or *European Information Planner (EIP)*  qualifications, all of which certify compliance and issued by the *European Financial Planning Association (EFPA),* a prestigious European association, whose functions are to certify the level of qualification of professionals in the banking sector and provide ongoing training in financial matters. The remaining 20% are in possession of other types of\n\nqualifications; such as wealth manager, financial analyst or any other of the qualifications considered valid by CNMV in compliance with MiFID II.\n\nIn addition, every year Renta 4 provides all employees who are in possession of any of these qualifications and who provide advisory services to customers, with ongoing training so that they can perform the 30 hours of recertification required by said regulations. In 2023, the number of hours of ongoing training carried out by these employees was 6,597 hours.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that since 2006, many years before the MiFID II regulations came into effect, making it compulsory for professionals in the financial and banking sector to have certifications approved by the regulatory bodies, Renta 4 had been training all the professionals in its commercial network in order for them to obtain one of these qualifications, as it considered that this training in financial products, taxation, financial planning, regulations and other basic aspects of the markets was a guarantee of quality when advising customers.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, in addition to training to obtain EFA and other similar qualifications validated by the CNMV, Renta 4 had an ongoing training plan, which included different training designed to provide employees with the knowledge, skills, and competences across every area and department of the company, depending on their training needs of a particular moment.\n\nSpecifically, during the 2023 financial year a total of 18,775.13 hours of training were given in the following training actions, including recertification hours and their distribution by category:\n\n| Training Action Name                                                                         | No. of hours |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Specialisation course in futures and equity options                                          | 66.00        |\n| Electric market course                                                                       | 8.00         |\n| Monographic Course on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism      | 22.67        |\n| Education for access to insurance distribution level 2                                       | 6,013.75     |\n| Access Training for Insurance Distribution Level II IBIPS Module                             | 50.00        |\n| ESG recertification hours (EFPA)                                                             | 218.50       |\n| LCCI recertification hours (EFPA)                                                            | 285.00       |\n| MIFID recertification hours (EFPA)                                                           | 6,093.50     |\n| Hours recertification Insurance (EFPA)                                                       | 1,188.00     |\n| Master in Double Degree (Blockchain Management and Blockchain Engineering) 2023              | 190.00       |\n| OTC'S Interest Rates - Structured Equity                                                     | 446.00       |\n| Effective presentations                                                                      | 72.00        |\n| Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Annually Renta 4 provides these employees with ongoing training of 25 hours, which certifies the recertification in said qualification in insurance, as required by the applicable regulations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 119 employees are in possession of the qualification *of Access to the Distribution of Insurance Level 2,* being able to market these insurance.\n\nAlso, every week Renta 4 electronically provides all its employees different knowledge pills on news in subjects such as; new investment products, market trends, taxation, as well as other issues such as money laundering prevention, technological risks, data protection, etc., all with the aim of keeping Renta 4 employees permanently trained and updated.\n\nIn this sense, it should be noted that in the last financial years Renta 4 considers technological risks one of the most important and of greatest risk for the company and its awareness is a strategic issue for the entity. For this reason, in recent years it has strengthened this area and has been carrying out ongoing training and awareness related to technological risks\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are areas and departments that regularly provide all employees with specific training in the subject matter of their field by regulatory requirement, awareness or strategic reasons of the company, such as in the area of money laundering prevention, regulatory compliance, data protection, etc. cybersecurity, etc., and the contents of which are detailed in each of the specific headings of this SNFI.\n\n# **Importance of In-House Training on Technological Risks**\n\nDuring the last financial year, a series of activities associated with the process of training and raising awareness about matters related to technological risks have been carried out, apart from those provided by the Security office or the risk management office:\n\n· Workshops on applicable regulations in the fields of Information Technology and Cybersecurity.\n\n· Training courses specific for the Board of Directors on technological risk management and third-party risks.\n\n· Preparing knowledge pills on security and thirdparty risks.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5. Company Relations**\n\nRenta 4 does not have a collective bargaining agreement at company level; however, the company applies the corresponding collective bargaining agreement to each of the companies and employees at the national level, according to their sector of activity, with the following agreements being applicable:\n\n| Company            | Collective agreement                        |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| R4 Banco           | Collective Agreement of the Banking Sector  |\n| R4 SV              | Collective agreement Stock Market of Madrid |\n| R4 Gestora         | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| R4 Pensiones       | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| R4 Corporate       | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| Renta 4 Chile      | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Peru       | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Colombia   | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Luxembourg | No Agreement                                |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, as shown in the following table, 86.7% of Renta 4's employees were covered by one of the aforementioned Spanish collective bargaining agreements, while the remaining 13.3% of the workforce is not covered by such agreements, as they provide their services in the companies abroad, in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg, where there are no applicable collective agreements, although we should state that there are employment regulations. In this regard, it should be noted that Renta 4 complies and rigorously applies at all times with the regulations in force in each of these countries: Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg.\n\n| Agreement              | No. of<br>employees | % Employees | No. Employees<br>subject to<br>agreement | % Employees<br>subject to<br>agreement |\n|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Banking Agreement      | 461                 | 68.81%      | 581                                      | 86.7%                                  |\n| Stock Market Agreement | 5                   | 0.75%       |                                          |                                        |\n| Madrid Offices         | 115                 | 17.16%      |                                          |                                        |\n| No Agreement           | 89                  | 13.28%      | 89                                       | 13.3%                                  |\n| TOTAL                  | 670                 | 100.00%     | 670                                      | 100.00%                                |\n\nAlso, despite the heterogeneous nature of the applicable collective agreements, Renta 4 applies homogeneous criteria and measures regarding work organisation, always seeking the homogeneous benefit of Renta 4's employees based on internal and external equality in Spain and abroad.\n\nRegarding social relations, Renta 4 does not have legal representation for workers. However, the Group keeps all its employees duly informed about the different policies and measures that the Company applies in the different areas, using the available communication channels, including an Employees' Portal, the company's intranet and various communications sent by email.\n\nIt should be noted that employees have channels that allow them a fluid and accessible communication, where suggestions, complaints and any type of proposals are collected, which the entity takes into consideration at all times, evaluating and studying each case.\n\nAlso, the Group has an Equality Plan, in accordance with the applicable Spanish law, to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for women and men, this being applicable through the adoption and implementation of various policies for this purpose, such as the promotion and guarantee of equal opportunities for selection and professional development at all levels of the company, and policies adapted to different social changes\n\nAs well, Renta 4 has a Protocol for the Prevention, Treatment, and Elimination of Sexual Harassment on the Grounds of Gender and Discrimination, in which it establishes the protocol for these types of issues. In particular, any employee can communicate these types of complaints through the electronic mailbox indicated in the protocol and created for that purpose or by presenting a letter in person.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there is also a Complaints Channel in Renta 4, which in the event that the Renta 4 Compliance Unit detects the receipt of any complaint, would immediately transfer the information and documentation, complying with the strictest duty of confidentiality to the HR management.\n\nIn this sense, Renta 4 expresses its resounding rejection, in the face of any unwanted behaviour of a sexual character or connotation, that has the purpose or produces the effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, degrading or offensive environment, and it undertakes not to tolerate such behaviours and to collaborate effectively in the prevention, detection, correction and sanction of this type of behaviour in the field of the company. During the financial year 2023 Renta 4 did not receive or process any complaints regarding harassment.\n\n#### **6. Work organisation**\n\nWith regard to the organisation of the work of the entity, Renta 4 has always aimed to improve the balance and reconcile the personal, family and work life of all its employees. Through this, it aims to improve the working environment, increase productivity and the attraction and retention of talent and for this have been implemented in recent years different measures, based on the flexibility and responsibility of professionals who form Renta 4, some of these measures are as follows:\n\n· Working hours with an annual estimate of 1,700 hours that do not exceed the amount established in applicable collective agreements.\n\n· Flexibility in check-in, check-out and meal rest times. There are flexibility measures in clocking in/ out and in break or food times, for those employees whose job characteristics and work centre allow it.\n\n· Adaptation of the working day duration and distribution, including remote working, duly justified and reasoned in these cases.\n\n· Hybrid model of teleworking in the headquarters of Renta 4. During the 2023 financial year, a hybrid teleworking model was maintained in those central services of the bank and in those departments that, due to the type of work and systems used it is feasible, and where it has been confirmed that said model is efficient, to combine face-toface and telematic work, without exceeding 30% of teleworking time. In this way, measures and\n\npolicies of flexibility and reconciliation of personal and family life continue to be implemented and strengthened.\n\n· Birth, adoption and foster care. All workers who make requests have the right to suspend their employment contract in case of birth, adoption, and fostering within the terms and means established by the Law, allowing the worker to enjoy such permits on a part-time basis, subject to agreement with the Company. Include the figures for 2023 and 2022, highlighting the number of permits enjoyed by parents\n\n· Breastfeeding permit. Employees who make the relevant request have one hour of breastfeeding leave per day until their child reaches 9 months of age, which may be split into two periods, one at the beginning and one at the end of the working day. Similarly, those employees who request it replace the breastfeeding permit, accumulating it over a period of 15 working days, being able to extend it up to the age of 12 months of the minor, provided that they enjoy it simultaneously, with the proportional reduction of the salary.\n\n· Reduction of working hours. Workers who make the relevant request shall have the right to reduce working hours to a maximum of half of the working day and a minimum of one-eighth of the working day for legal guardianship and/or direct care of a family member, and a proportional reduction in salary shall be considered following the specifications established in applicable collective agreements and regulations.\n\n· Leaves of absence for different reasons. Employees may request leaves of absence for several reasons, including the care of children and direct family members, preserving their job or the same professional group, and the exercise \n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nof a public position that is incompatible with their job, following the regulations established in applicable collective agreements and regulations.\n\n· Unpaid leave. Employees may request unpaid leave in case of, for example, duly accredited family needs, care of relatives up to the first degree of consanguinity or affinity, and the completion of higher education or PhDs.\n\n· Renta 4 has a Digital Disconnection Policy.\n\n#### **Absenteeism - Leave for Birth and Care of Child**\n\nWith regard to the absenteeism figures relating to suspensions for childbirth and childcare (maternity and paternity), as well as those relating to occupational accidents, the data on the number of absence hours during 2023 and 2022 are shown.\n\n#### **Hours of Absenteeism for Birth and Care of Child**\n\nThe number of absence hours have been calculated considering the number of effective working hours per day (7.75 hours per day, full time, or its equivalent on a part-time basis) by the number of working days of absence\n\n| Leave type                        | 2023      | 2022      | Variation % |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Birth and care of child           | 12,777.81 | 11,524.25 | 11%         |\n| Men                               | 8,321.56  | 6,324.00  | 32%         |\n| Women                             | 4,456.25  | 5,200.25  | -14%        |\n| Birth and care of child part-time | 1,549.76  | 937.75    | 65%         |\n| Men                               | 1,240.00  | 705.25    | 76%         |\n| Women                             | 309.76    | 232.50    | 33%         |\n| Total hours                       | 14,327.57 | 12,462.00 | 15%         |\n\n#### **Absenteeism – Accidents at Work**\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year there were a total of six occupational accidents, one fewer than 2022, of which only three resulted in medical leave, those which occurred while commuting.\n\nThe following tables show the number of occupational accidents according to their classification, seriousness and frequency, as well as the number of absence hours due to these accidents, distributed by gender.\n\n| Type of occupational accident                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2023   | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Commuting                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 237.34 | -

Therefore, Renta 4 strictly complies with the applicable regulations where it develops its activity.\n\nIn relation to occupational accidents and occupational diseases, in the 2023 financial year Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC, S.A. had MAZ (0011) contracted as the Mutual Insurance Company for Occupational Accidents and had S.A., Renta 4 Pensiones, S.A., Renta 4 S.V., S.A. and Renta 4 Corporate contracted to Umivale Activa (0015).\n\nThe above mentioned insurance companies are responsible, for example, for the management of contingencies arising from occupational accidents and diseases, the provision of benefits derived from them, coverage and health care, management of occupational accident reports and preventive activities, as well as the management, control, and monitoring of economic benefits and temporary disability arising from common contingencies.\n\nIn the area of Occupational Risk Prevention Renta 4 has contracted a service of prevention of external risks, through the entity, VALUES PREVENTION, which carries out the provision of services of preventive activities of occupational risks in the field of health surveillance and technical specialities, thus complying with the regulations on prevention.\n\nSpecifically, VALORA PREVENCIÓN carries out the risk assessment in the facilities of the 63 offices it has nationwide, as well as the risk assessment of the different job positions that exist in the company.\n\nAlso, regarding health control, Renta 4 offers all its employees the possibility of having a complete medical examination on an annual basis, through VALORA PREVENCIÓN. Such medical examinations are voluntary and confidential and are intended, on the one hand, to enable the Company to confirm whether or not its employees are fit for the performance of work, not receiving any additional information on the results because they are confidential and, on the other hand, that employees can know their health status, in an agile manner and with extensive medical tests that allow to carry out a preventive medical activity of early detection of diseases.\n\nIn this sense, it should be noted that in recent years Renta 4 has incorporated additional tests in the analytical analysis with the aim of detecting in a preventive way possible pathologies and frequent diseases that could suffer employees, such as heart disease, prostate cancer, colon, diabetes, etc. In general, the number of employees who carry out such medical examinations annually exceeds 50% of the workforce and is highly valued by employees.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 has, among others, the corresponding Risk Prevention Plan, Annual Activity Report and Emergency Plan. On the other hand, Renta 4 promotes other activities such as training, giving courses for employees on occupational risks in facilities and first aid. These courses are given by an external provider through the ORP contract and such training is given with the frequency recommended by the ORP regulations and according to the needs of each area or office in each financial year.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4, supplementing preventive activities and health care, has two (2) defibrillators called *AED PLUS (ZOLL) installed at its headquarters,* in order to be able to assist in case of need any cardiac type emergency that could occur in the facilities of Renta 4 and periodically these devices are reviewed and the corresponding maintenance is performed. Since its installation it has not been necessary to use it.\n\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that since 2017 the European Commission has been pointing out the importance of psychosocial risks, especially occupational stress, as one of the most complex and growing health problems at work. It has been recognised that this stress has harmful effects on both the health of the worker and the organisation of work and to him half of the days of lost work, reduces the performance and can lead to an increase in the work accidents.\n\nFor this reason, during the year 2023 Renta 4 has carried out a Psychosocial Risk Assessment (Climate Survey) by an external company, whose objective was to identify and measure the working conditions related to the organisation of work and that could represent a risk to health. The results treated collectively and anonymously serve to improve working conditions if necessary.\n\nAt this point it is necessary to highlight the wide participation of the employees of Renta 4 and the results that have been obtained from it have been satisfactory, without having detected any area in which the entity must act, considering that the working climate in Renta 4 in general is adequate.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 promotes activities aimed at the health care of its employees, such as physical activity in the facilities of the central services of the entity, where employees have an adapted space for the realisation of directed sports activities, such as yoga, yoga, sports and sports activities. pilates and \"Moreta Method\" which is a type of postural gymnastics taught by physiotherapists. Activities co-financed by Renta 4.\n\nIn addition, during the last financial years Renta 4 has organised activities outside the workplace, on the one hand, a padel tournament for employees, which has been well received and has allowed in addition to practising a sport, encouraging the feeling of belonging and reinforcing the team building and a golf tournament. Annually Renta 4 has organised for the children of employees a children's Christmas party, a Christmas contest and the construction by employees of a Christmas \"Portal of Bethlehem\" with recycled figures.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 promotes solidarity and volunteering activities, such as collaboration in the preparation of Christmas baskets with the NGO AVANZA, blood donation campaigns with the Spanish Red Cross, as well as the organisation of a Christmas market for charitable purposes.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **A. REMUNERATION POLICY OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR IN PROGRESS**\n\n**A.1.1** To explain the current policy for the remuneration of directors applicable to the year in progress. Where relevant, certain information may be stated in relation to the remuneration policy approved by the general meeting of shareholders, provided the addition is clear, specific and concrete.\n\nThe specific determinations for the current year shall be described, both of the remuneration of directors for their status as such and for the performance of executive functions that the board has carried out in accordance with the provisions of the contracts signed with the executive directors and with the remuneration policy approved by the general shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe following aspects, as a minimum, must be reported in any case:\n\n- **a)** Description of the procedures and bodies of the company involved in determining and applying the remuneration policy and their conditions.\n- **b)** State and where appropriate explain whether consideration have been given to comparable companies for the purposes of establishing the company's remuneration policy.\n- **c)** Information as to whether an external advisor was involved and, should this be the case, the identity of the advisor.\n- **d)** Procedures under the existing directors' remuneration policy for applying temporary exceptions to the policy, the conditions under which such exceptions may be used and the components that may be subject to exception under the policy.\n\nThe purpose of the remuneration policy (the \"RP\") on directors of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (the \"Company\" or \"Renta 4\") is to align the interests of the shareholders with those of the Company, seeking prudent management of the activity and minimizing the risks inherent in it, rewarding the work of the Company's personnel in achieving this purpose and ensuring that remuneration is adjusted to the market conditions of credit institutions that are comparable in terms of their size, and to criteria of moderation and adaptation to the Company's results. All of the above, in accordance with the Regulations of the Board of Directors (the \"BoD\") of Renta 4, and in order to contribute to the Company's ability to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries out its activity.\n\nIn this regard, and within the framework of the provisions of the Byelaws, the Regulations of the BoD of the Company assign to this body the power to adopt the decisions to be proposed to the General Meeting (GMS) regarding the remuneration of directors. In accordance with the best corporate governance practices, the Board of Directors (\"BoD\") of the Company has, for the best performance of its duties, established Committees that assist it in matters within its remit. Of these, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (the \"ARC\") is the body that advises and informs the BoD on remuneration issues, among others, assigned to it in the Board Regulations, ensuring compliance with the remuneration policy established by the Company's GMS and proposing, where appropriate, any modifications it deems appropriate.\n\nFor this reason, the BoD, in the exercise of its functions, shall approve, at the proposal of the ARC, the RP for the next 3 years and submit it to the Company's GMS for approval.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article 32 of the Board of Directors Regulations, the ARC is currently made up of three members appointed by the Board of Directors, Ms. Gema Aznar Cornejo, Mr. Jose Ramon Rubio Laporta, as independent directors and Mr. Pedro Ángel Navarro Martínez, as other external director. This ARC meets as often as is necessary for the performance of its duties, convened by its Chairman or, as the case may be, by the Chairman of the BoD, at least once a quarter.\n\nIn 2023, the ARC met three times to discuss issues within its remit.\n\nWithout prejudice to other duties assigned to it by the BoD, the ARC has, in relation to matters of remuneration, the following powers:\n\n- to ensure that the remuneration policy established by the Company is observed and, in particular, review it on a regular basis and propose to the BoD the RP for directors, senior executives, executive committees, executive directors and, where appropriate, categories of employees who, owing to the duties they perform, are included in the remuneration policy by virtue of the applicable regulations, the application thereof, including share-based remuneration systems and their application, as well as to guarantee that individual remuneration is proportional to that paid to directors and senior executives;\n\n- to propose the individual remuneration and the terms and conditions of the contracts of executive directors and the basic conditions of the contracts of senior executives, all in accordance with the RP approved by the GMS;\n\n- to oversee the transparency of remuneration and the observance of the remuneration policy established by the Company.\n\nIn this sense, the ARC will propose, if appropriate, the corresponding modifications of the RP to the BoD, for its submission and subsequent approval, if necessary, by the GMS.\n\nThe Regulations of the BoD, both with regard to the ARC itself and for directors in general, establish that all of them may request external advice on any matters they consider necessary. In this regard, it should be noted that in the 2023 financial year neither the ARC nor the BoD have requested and, therefore, have not had the assistance of external advisers to establish this remuneration policy.\n\nThe Company's Corporate Governance rules have been configured so that proposals submitted for consideration by the BoD in remuneration matters originate from the ARC, which analyses them beforehand, relying on the Company's internal services and external experts when necessary. In addition, all remuneration decisions affecting the directors have been submitted (or will be submitted) to an advisory vote of the Company's GMS, which ensures the appropriate decision-making process in relation to remuneration.\n\n**A.1.2** Relative importance of items of variable remuneration in relation to the fixed items (remuneration mix) and the criteria and objectives taken into account to determine them and to guarantee a proper balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration. In particular, indicate the actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system to reduce exposure to excessive risks and align it with the company's objectives, values and long-term interests, including, where appropriate, a reference to measures envisaged to ensure that the remuneration policy addresses the company's longterm performance of the company, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the entity's risk profile and measures envisaged to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nAlso indicate whether the company has established any vesting or consolidation period for certain variable remuneration items, in cash, shares or other financial instruments, a period of deferral in the payment of amounts or delivery of financial instruments already vested and consolidated, or whether any clause has been agreed to reduce deferred remuneration not yet consolidated or that obliges the director to the reimbursement of remuneration received when such remuneration has been based on data has subsequently been proven to be manifestly inaccurate.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy seeks to establish a remuneration scheme appropriate to the engagement and responsibility undertaken by the people to whom it applies, with the aim of attracting, retaining and motivating the most outstanding professionals as well as contributing to the Company so that it is able to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries on its activity. For this reason, and as established in the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the remuneration will be adjusted to the market conditions of credit institutions of a size similar to Renta 4 and based on criteria of moderation and proportionality to the results of the Company.\n\nTherefore, the remuneration policy is based, among other things, on the following principles:\n\n**(a)** The Remuneration Policy applies both to executive and non-executive members of the Board of Directors, to senior executives, as well as to categories of employees of the Company whose professional activities have a material impact on the Company's risk profile and those who exercise control functions, as well as categories of employees of the Company who receive a global remuneration that includes them in the same scale of remuneration as that of senior executives and employees who take on risks, whose professional activities have a material impact on the Company's risk profile.,in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\n**(b)** The Remuneration Policy is compatible with appropriate and effective management of risk, and fosters such management in all circumstances, without offering, consequently, incentives for a assuming a level of risk that exceeds the level of risk tolerated by the Company.\n\n**(c)** The Remuneration Policy is aligned and compatible with the Company's business strategy, objectives, values and long-term interests, and is subject to annual review, with the Board proposing, as appropriate, any modifications it deems appropriate.\n\n**(d)** The remuneration paid by the Company in accordance with these principles follows criteria of moderation and proportionality to the Group's results, and favours sound and effective risk management that prevents conflicts of interests.\n\n**(e)** In this sense, remuneration establishes an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable items, and takes into consideration the responsibility and level of commitment of each individual, as well as all types of current and future risks.\n\n**(f)** The variable remuneration has sufficient flexibility that enables its modulation to the point that it is possible to completely eliminate variable remuneration.\n\n**(g)** EIt assesses performance in order to calculate the variable items of remuneration or the funds to pay for these items; an adjustment is made for all types of current and future risks, and the cost of capital and liquidity required is taken into account.\n\n**(h)** Variable remuneration is only paid if it is sustainable with the situation of the Company, and if it is justified based on the results of the Company, the business unit and the employee in question, and the Company may, for these purposes, retain part or even all of it.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis assessment is part of a multi-year framework ensuring that the assessment process is based on long-term results and that the actual payment of variable items is spread over the period covered by the Remuneration Policy.\n\n**(i)** Payments for early termination of a contract are based on the results obtained over time, established in such a way that they do not reward poor performance.\n\n**(j)** The pension policy is compatible with the Company's business strategy, objectives and values and long-term interests of the Company.\n\n**(k)** Any scheme for rights of widowhood, orphanhood and death that is established is consistent with the market and the provisions of applicable regulations.\n\nFurthermore, in relation to the relative weight of variable remuneration items in relation to fixed ones, the principles on which the Remuneration Policy is based state that it will establish an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable items, always taking into consideration the responsibility and level of commitment involved in the role that each individual is called upon to play, as well as all types of current and future risks, an aspect that is covered in the Policy. In this regard, the Company's executive directors currently receive variable remuneration based on the performance of their executive duties, as indicated in section A.1.6 below.\n\nIn relation to the measures established in the Remuneration Policy that takes into account the results of the Company, according to provisions of section A.1.6. below that includes the objective criteria relating to the evolution of the Company's results for determining directors' variable remuneration. Furthermore, the Company's Remuneration Policy provides for an adequate balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration for, as noted in section A.1.6, variable compensation depends on the achievement of objective criteria established by the CA and linked mainly to the objective results of the Company, level of delinquency and ESG policies.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the clawback formulae or clauses to claim back variable components of remuneration, it is envisaged that in the event that the assessments conclude that performance has been deficient, the Company may reduce the deferred variable remuneration and/or claim the reimbursement of the variable remuneration already paid, up to a maximum of 100%, in either case. These assessments will analyse subsequent performance according to the criteria (indicated in section A.1.6 below), which contributed to achieving the objectives, comparing it with the initial performance assessment and will be approved by the Board of Directors at the end of the year to which said variable remuneration refers.\n\n**A.1.3** The amount and nature of any fixed components expected to accrue in the course of the year to directors in their capacity as such.\n\nNon-Executive Directors shall receive annual remuneration appropriate to market standards for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, taking into account the duties and responsibilities exercised by each of the directors within the Board itself or its Committees.\n\nThe amount of the remuneration that the Company may pay to the entirety of its Non-Executive Directors for these items shall not exceed the maximum amount set for this purpose by the General Meeting.\n\nIn this sense, the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors will consist of a fixed annual amount for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, amounting to €80,000 gross per annum for each of them.\n\nIn addition, those non-executive Board Members who are members of any of the Board Committees, whether as Chairman or member, shall receive 20,000 euros gross per year, in addition to the remuneration they receive in their capacity as non-executive directors. As a rule of good governance, the committees shall be composed solely of Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe maximum overall amount shall be €920,000, at the rate of €80,000 gross for each of the ten (10) Non-Executive Directors currently forming the Board, increased by an additional €120,000, €20,000 for each member of the two (2) existing Board committees, which are currently made up of three (3) members in each.\n\nIf the number of members of each of the two (2) commissions is increased, up to a maximum of four (4) members, i.e. up to a maximum of eight (8) members in total, the maximum overall amount would be €960,000 for all Non-Executive Directors. This amount includes both the annual fixed remuneration for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, as well as the remuneration corresponding to the membership of the commissions of up to a maximum of eight (8) members in total.\n\nThe Executive Directors will not receive any remuneration for their position as Company Directors, and their remuneration will only be that received for their executive functions, as indicated in the following sections, the scheme of which is set out in section A.1.item 4 below.\n\n**A.1.4** The amount and nature of any fixed components that will accrue in the year to directors for performance of senior management functions of the executive directors.\n\nIt should be noted that the remuneration system established by the company for executive directors takes into account the specific characteristics of each position, the duties attributed, the level of responsibility, the level of commitment taken on and engagement required, all for the purpose of the ARC establishing, determining and/or updating remunerations in order to be competitive in the market in equivalent posts in competing companies.\n\nThe executive directors whose appointment as directors is associated with their executive functions are:\n\n- Chairman with executive functions: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo.\n\n- CEO: Mr Juan Luis López García.\n- Director and General Manager: Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González.\n- Director and Regional Manager: Mr Santiago González Enciso.\n\nThe compensation of executive directors, based on their responsibility, attributed duties and level of commitment, in terms of fixed remuneration for financial year 2024 will be as follows:\n\n**i.** Chairman: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, Executive Chairman received a fixed annual remuneration of €300.000 gross, to be paid in 12 equal monthly instalments.\n\n**ii.** The CEO of the Company Mr Juan Luis López García will have fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n**iii.** Director and General Manager Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, will have a fixed annual compensation of €275,000 gross.\n\n**iv.** Director and General Manager Mr Santiago González Enciso, will have a fixed annual compensation of €95,000 gross.\n\nIn relation to the estimation of the fixed annual remuneration, given that the amounts indicated are fixed and will not depend on any objective or variable aspect, there is no estimation in this regard, where said amount are the fixed remuneration each of them will receive during the year 2024 for their positions.\n\n**A.1.5** Amount and nature of any remuneration in kind component that will be accrued in the year, including, but not limited to, insurance premiums paid on behalf of the director.\n\nThe Company has taken out a group liability insurance policy that covers any liability of any kind for acts and conduct of the Executive Officers (Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, General Manager and Regional Director), as well as those of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company, as a result of the performance of the activities inherent to their functions.\n\n**A.1.6** The amount and nature of the variable components, with a distinction made between those established in the short term and in the long term. Financial and non-financial parameters, including social, environmental and climate change parameters, selected to determine variable remuneration in the current year, explaining the extent to which such parameters are related to the performance of both the director and the company and its risk profile, and the methodology, time required and techniques envisaged to determine, at the end of the year, the effective degree of compliance with the parameters used in the design of the variable remuneration, explaining the criteria and factors applied in terms of the time required and methods for verifying that the performance conditions or any other type of conditions to which the accrual and consolidation of each component of the variable remuneration was linked have been effectively met.\n\nSpecify the range in monetary terms of the different variable components depending on the level of compliance with the objectives and parameters established, and whether there is any maximum monetary amount in absolute terms exists.\n\nThe variable remuneration of the directors of Renta 4 according to their responsibility, attributed functions and level of commitment is structured as follows:\n\n#### **1. REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS**\n\nNon-executive directors do not currently have a Variable Remuneration Plan.\n\n#### **2. REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS**\n\nExecutive directors currently have the following Variable Remuneration Plan:\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/199/Picture/18 description: The image shows the number 200 in white text on a dark blue background. The background is partially obscured by a white shape on the left side of the image.\n\n#### **2.1. Variable Remuneration of the Chairman for his executive functions:**\n\nMr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, as Executive Chairman, in 2024 will receive an Annual Variable Remuneration (\"AVR\") determined by the corresponding amount accrued according to the level of compliance with the year's targets linked to the Net Profit of the Group (\"NP\"), which will be set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that are specifically assigned by the Board of Directors (\"BoD\") to the Chairman.\n\nIn line with the principles, the Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying moderation and adequacy criteria to the results of the Renta 4 Group, favours a solid and effective risk management. For this reason, AVR will be received provided that the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the financial year are less than 5% of the Net Profit (\"NP\") at the end of the year and when these levels do not occur as a result of actions by the Company, in which the risk levels and limits permitted and established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) or any other competent entity for this purpose are exceeded, due to defects in the control systems of the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to omission or poor practices by the Company.\n\nOn the other hand, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element in terms of remuneration of the group and links it to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. The components of remuneration contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. Therefore, the Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met. All of the above will be included in the annual performance evaluation carried out by the Company's Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe annual targets will be calculated on the basis of the NP and for the year 2024, they have been established according to the following scale:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration, hereinafter, \"FAR\". - Net Profit: €[18– 19) million = 14 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[19– 20) million = 28 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[20- 21) million = 42 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[21- 22) million = 56 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[22- 23) million = 70% of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[23- 24) million = 84 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[24- 25) million = 98 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[25- 26) million = 112 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[26- 27) million = 126 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[27- 28) million = 140 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[28- 29) million = 154 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[29- 30) million = 168 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[30- 31) million = 182 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[31- 32) million = 196 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: > €32 million = 200 % of \"FAR\"\n\nIn order to determine the AVR to be received by the President in each year, an assessment shall be carried out (i) of the proper management of the integration of sustainability risks and ESG policies, as well as (ii) of the achievement of the annual profit targets, once all the necessary figures that have been established as objectives are known.\n\n#### **2.2. Remuneration of CEO and of Director and General Manager**\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Juan Luis López García and the Director and General Manager, Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González will receive an AVR that will be determined by the corresponding amount accrued depending on the level of compliance with the Year's Targets, linked to the Net Profit of the Group (\"NP\"), to be established annually.\n\nIn line with the principles, the Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying moderation and adequacy criteria to the results of the Renta 4 Group, favours a solid and effective risk management. For this reason, AVR will be received provided that the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the financial year are less than 5% of the Net Profit (\"NP\") at the end of the year and when these levels do not occur as a result of actions by the Company, in which the risk levels and limits permitted and established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) or any other competent entity for this purpose are exceeded, due to defects in the control systems of the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to omission or poor practices by the Company.\n\nOn the other hand, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element in terms of remuneration of the group and links it to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. The components of remuneration contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. Therefore, the Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met. All of the above will be included in the annual performance evaluation carried out by the Company's Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Year's Targets will be calculated on the basis of the NP and for the year 2024, they have been established according to the following scale:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[18– 19) million = 14 % of \"FAR\"\n\n- Net Profit: €[19– 20) million = 28 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[20- 21) million = 42 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[21- 22) million = 56 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[22- 23) million = 70% of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[23- 24) million = 84 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[24- 25) million = 98 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[25- 26) million = 112 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[26- 27) million = 126 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[27- 28) million = 140 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[28- 29) million = 154 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[29- 30) million = 168 % of \"FAR\"\n\n- Net Profit: €[30- 31) million = 182 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[31- 32) million = 196 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: > €32 million = 200 % of \"FAR\"\n\nThe provisions of article 34.1.g of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit entities, shall be applied to determine the Annual Variable Remuneration to be received by the Chief Executive Officer and the Director and General Manager for each financial year.\n\n## **2.3. Variable Remuneration of the Director and Regional Manager.**\n\nThe Regional Director shall receive an AVR determined by the corresponding amount accrued based on the extent to which annual Group Net Profit (\"GNP\") targets are met.\n\nThe Year's Targets will be calculated on the basis of the NP and for the year 2024, they have been established according to the following scale:\n\n```\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[18– 19) million = 14 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[19– 20) million = 28 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[20- 21) million = 42 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[21- 22) million = 56 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[22- 23) million = 70% of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[23- 24) million = 84 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[24- 25) million = 98 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[25- 26) million = 112 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[26- 27) million = 126 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[27- 28) million = 140 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[28- 29) million = 154 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[29- 30) million = 168 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[30- 31) million = 182 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: €[31- 32) million = 196 % of \"FAR\"\n- Net Profit: > €32 million = 200 % of \"FAR\"\n```\nThe provisions of article 34.1.g of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit entities, shall be applied to determine the Annual Variable Remuneration. of credit companies.\n\nThe AVR will be paid as long as the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the year remain below 5% of the E at the end of year and when these levels do not occur as a result of the Company's actions, in which the risk levels and limits allowed and established by the EBA or any other competent body are exceeded, due to deficient control systems used by the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to the Company's inaction or poor practices.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible.\n\nTherefore, the Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met. All of the above will be included in the annual performance evaluation carried out by the Company's Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn order to determine the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to the Executive Chairman, CEO, General Manager and Regional Manager, an assessment shall be made i) on the appropriate management of ESG policies and sustainability risk integration, as well as ii) of the degree of compliance with the annual objectives ('AO'), once all the figures linked to said objectives are known and the provisions of article 34.1.g of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit entities, shall be applied.\n\nIf the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration that each of them would be entitled to receive is between 0% and 100% of \"FAR\", 60% shall be paid within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of March of the calendar year following the corresponding financial year in which it has accrued.\n\nThe remaining 40% will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a maximum rate of 10% in each of the four deferral periods. The payment due must be made before the end of the corresponding month of March of the calendar year following each of the years in which the deferral has taken place.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nOn the other hand, if the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration is between 100% and 200% of the AVR, it will be considered as a \"particularly high amount\" in accordance with letter m) of Article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of Credit Companies and 40% of the amount of this \"especially high amount\" AVR shall be paid, within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the finalization of the month of March of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued.\n\nThe remaining 60% of the \"particularly high\" AVR will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a rate of 15% of the total of this AVR in each of the deferral years.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nThe payment of the Total AVR will be made 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in shares, both the AVR accrued between 0% and 100% of \"FAR\", whose payment is 60% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the year in which it has\n\naccrued, deferring the 40% in the following 4 calendar years, as in the case of the \"particularly high amount\" AVR accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the FAR, whose payment is 40% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the year in which it has accrued, varying the 60% in the following 4 calendar years at a rate of 15% per year.\n\nIn order to calculate the number of accrued shares to be delivered, for each payment year the share's average market value during the last 20 business days of the previous year shall be taken into consideration, the shares being non-transferable for a period of 3 years from delivery, unless (i) there is, at the time of transmission or financial year, a net economic exposure to a change in the share price for a market value equivalent to an amount of at least 2 times its annual fixed remuneration through share ownership; or (ii) in respect of the actions that need to be disposed of to meet the costs related to their acquisition or, after favourable assessment by the Commission of Appointments and Remunerations, to deal with extraordinary situations which arise.\n\nIn any case, the Company may claim the reimbursement of the variable components of the remuneration paid, when payment has not been in accordance with the conditions established for its accrual, provided that this is due to justifiable reasons and they are duly accredited or when they have been paid based on data whose inaccuracy is subsequently accredited. Likewise, the Company may not proceed with the payment, in whole or in part, of the deferred remuneration corresponding to a specific period if, when payment is due, an extraordinary event were to occur that made it advisable to do so.\n\nThe total amount of the AVR obtained as a result of the application of the AVR system, depending on the level of fulfilment of the NP and objectives set for the Executive Chairman, CEO, General Manager and Regional Manager, may not involve the Group's NP falling below €18M by 2024. Otherwise, the Total VR Amount will have to be adjusted proportionally until the 2024 NP is at least €18 million.\n\nLikewise, and to estimate the total amount of the variable remunerations to which the current system would give rise, depending on the level of fulfilment with the assumptions or objectives taken as a benchmark, the Company considers that it could be determined in the following maximum amounts:\n\n- Chairman with executive functions: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo would receive a maximum of €600,000 gross. - CEO: -The CEO, Mr Juan Luis López García will receive a maximum of €550,000 gross. - General Manager: Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González €550.000 gross. - Regional Manager: Mr Santiago González Enciso €190,000 gross.\n\n**A.1.7** Main characteristics of long-term savings systems.

OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE COURSE OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR**\n\n**B.1.1** Explain the process carried out to apply the remuneration policy and determine the individual remuneration set out in section C of this report. This information shall include the role played by the remuneration committee, the decisions taken by the board of directors and, if applicable, the identity and role of the external advisors whose services have been used in the process of application of the compensation policy in the year ended.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 22 February 2022 and at the proposal of the ARC, resolved, under point nine of the Agenda, to approve the Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 and, in turn, to submit it for approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, which approved this policy with 99.99% in favor and 0.001% abstentions of those present or representing share capital, in accordance with the responsibility, functions attributed and level of commitment taken on by the Renta 4 directors.\n\nLikewise, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of 26 February 2024, and pursuant to the process of assessment of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman, the CEO and the Coordinating Director, as well as the performance of the Company in 2023 through the results included in the financial statements, has determined, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy in force, the variable remuneration due to directors with executive functions specified in section C below.\n\n**B.1.2** Explain any deviations from the established procedure for the application of the remunerations policy that have occurred during the fiscal year.\n\nThere have been no deviations from the procedure established for the application of the remuneration policy during the financial year 2023.\n\n**B.1.3** Indicate whether any temporary exceptions have been applied to the remuneration policy and, if applied, explain the exceptional circumstances that have led to the application of these exceptions, the specific components of the remuneration policy affected and the reasons why the entity considers that these exceptions have been necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the company as a whole or to ensure its viability. Also quantify the impact that the implementation of these exceptions has had on the compensation of each director during the year.\n\nThere have been no temporary exceptions to the compensation policy during the financial year.\n\n**B.2.** Explain the different actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system and how they have contributed to reducing exposure to excessive risks and aligning it with the company's objectives, values and long-term interests, including a reference to the measures that have been taken to ensure that the remuneration accrued has addressed the long-term performance of the company and achieved an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration, what measures have been taken in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the entity, and what measures have been taken to avoid conflicts of interest, if any.\n\nIn relation to the measures envisaged to guarantee that the Remuneration Policy takes into account the long-term results of the Company, section A.1. below includes the objective criteria relating to the Company's results applied to determine directors' variable remuneration.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's Remuneration Policy finds a suitable balance between the fixed and variable items in the remuneration considering that, as shown in section A.1. above, the variable remuneration set for 2023 is based on the fulfilment of the objective criteria defined by the Board, always linked to the objective results of the Company and subject to the Remuneration Policy approved\n\nat the Ordinary General Meeting of 30 March 2022.\n\nLastly, in relation to the clawback formulae or clauses to claim back the variable remuneration items, it is envisaged that, should the assessments conclude a deficient performance, or when they have been paid on the basis of data subsequently found to be inaccurate, the Company may reduce the deferred variable remuneration and/or claim the reimbursement of the variable remuneration already paid, up to a maximum of 100%, in either case. These evaluations analyse the evolution of the subsequent performance according to the criteria (indicated in section A.1 above, as they are the same for the current year and the reported year), which contributed to achieving the objectives, comparing it with the initial performance assessment and will be approved by the Board of Directors at the end of the year such variable remuneration refers to.\n\n**B.3.** Explain how the remuneration accrued during the year meets the provisions of the remuneration policy in force and, in particular, how it contributes to the sustainable and long-term performance of the company.\n\nAlso report on the relationship between the remuneration obtained by the directors and the results or other short and long term performance measures of the entity, explaining, if applicable, how variations in the company's performance may have had an impact on the change in directors' remuneration, including accruals for which payment has been deferred, and how they contribute to the short- and long-term results of the company.\n\nBased on the Company's director remuneration policy for 2023 indicated in section B.7 below, the executive directors' remuneration is linked to the results produced by the Company. In this regard, and taking into account what is indicated in said section, certain variable remuneration is conditional upon fulfilment of the indicators also included in section B.7. below.\n\nIn 2023, the total remuneration paid to the Company's directors in their capacity as such was €920,000, in observance of the maximum amount of €960,000 for this item as established in the Remuneration Policy and approved by the GSM. Individual remuneration of each Director in his capacity as such, consisted of an annual fixed amount, as established in said policy and those non-executive directors who were part of any of the committees, received an additional annual remuneration under this item, the amount being proportional to the time in which each director was on the Board and/or on the committee. Executive directors did not receive remuneration for their membership of the Board of Directors or of its committees; nor did they receive any annual fixed amounts, or of attendance fees for meetings of the Board of Directors. In this regard, the executive directors received remuneration in the amounts to which they were entitled by virtue of their respective contracts drawn up with the Company, pursuant to the Remuneration Policy.\n\nAt a meeting on 26 February 2024, at the behest of the ARC, the Board of Directors determined the sums of the annual variable remuneration of Executive Directors accrued in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nFor the purposes of determining the variable remuneration accrued to the executive directors, consideration was given to professional engagement and excellence, the level of achievement of the targets of the annual budget, investment targets, and the result of assessment of the performance of their duties, in relation to which a variable remuneration of 126% was determined in relation to the fixed annual remuneration to which each director is entitled. Section B7 of this report contains more information in connection with these conditions.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nf the remuneration systems accrued in the course of

**Observations**\n\n**B.5.** Explain how the fixed items accrued during the financial year by the directors in their capacity as such have been determined, their proportion by director and how they have varied with respect to the previous financial year.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 22 February 2022 and at the proposal of the ARC, resolved, under point nine of the Agenda, to approve the Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 and, in turn, to submit it for its approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, which approved the policy at its ordinary meeting on 30 March 2022, taking into account the market standards to determine the fixed annual remuneration for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn this regard, each non-executive director, as such, during the financial year 2023 has received a fixed annual amount for the performance of their functions as a member of the Board of Directors of €80,000.00 per year, and those who form part of any of the Board's commissions have received an additional annual remuneration of €20,000.\n\n**B.6.** Explain how the salaries accrued during the year to each of the executive directors for carrying out management functions were determined, and how they changed compared to the previous year.\n\nIn accordance with the Remunerations Policy approved at the ordinary general meeting of 26 March 2022, the remuneration paid to thee Executive Directors during the 2023 fiscal year was:\n\n• Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, Executive Chairman received a fixed annual remuneration of €300,000 gross.\n\n• Mr Juan Luis López García, CEO received a fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n• Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager, received a fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n• The Director and Regional Manager Mr Santiago González Enciso received a fixed annual remuneration of €95,000 gross.\n\nIt should be noted that the fixed remuneration paid to the Executive Directors during the 2023 fiscal year amounted to 945,000, the same amount received by all of them, as fixed remuneration in 2022, 2021 and 2020, except for Mr. Enciso for whom an increase in remuneration was approved in 2021 to an annual gross amount of €95,000, from the €75,000 he had been receiving in previous fiscal years.\n\n**B.7.** Explain the nature and main characteristics of the variable components of the remuneration systems accrued in the course of the year.\n\n#### In particular:\n\n- **a)** Identify each of the compensation plans that have determined the different variable compensation accrued by each of the directors during the fiscal year ended, including information on their scope, date of approval, date of implementation, vesting conditions, if any, vesting periods and term, criteria used for performance evaluation and how this has impacted on the setting of the variable amount accrued, as well as the measurement criteria used and the time required to be able to adequately measure all conditions and criteria should be explained in detail in terms of the time required and methods for verifying that the conditions and criteria have been effectively met performance conditions or any other type of conditions to which the accrual and vesting of each component of variable compensation was linked.\n- **b)** In the case of stock option plans or other financial instruments, the general characteristics of each plan shall include information on the conditions both to acquire unconditional ownership (vesting) and to be able to exercise such options or financial instruments, including the exercise price and term.\n- **c)** Each of the directors, and their category (executive directors, external proprietary directors, independent external directors or other external directors), who are beneficiaries of remuneration systems or plans that include variable remuneration.\n- **d)** Where appropriate, information will be provided in relation to any periods established for the accrual or deferral of payment that may have been applied, and/or retention/non-availability periods for shares or other financial instruments, if any.\n\nExplain the short-term variable components of the remuneration systems:\n\nThe Remuneration Policy establishes that non-executive directors shall not have a Variable Remuneration Plan.\n\nAs regards the executive directors, the variable remuneration model established in the financial year 2023 is as follows:\n\n**1) Variable remuneration of Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, as Executive Chairman.**\n\nMr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo will receive an Annual Variable Remuneration (\"AVR\"), consisting of up to a maximum of 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration (\"AFR\").\n\nThe Annual Variable Remuneration is determined by the amount corresponding to the amount accrued in accordance with the fulfilment of year's targets linked to the Net Profit of the Group, (\"Year's Targets\") that have been fixed in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that the Board of Directors has specifically assigned to the Chairman.\n\nIn line with the principles of the Renta 4 Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying the criteria of moderation and proportionality to the results of the Renta 4 Group, solid and effective risk management is fostered. For this reason, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the year remain below 5% of the Equity at year end, and when such levels are not attributed to the Company's actions, when the risk levels and limits allowed and established by the EBA (European Bank Authority) or any other competent organization are exceeded, due to deficient control systems used by the Renta 4 Group or any other cause attributed to the Company's inaction or poor practices. Furthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. Therefore, this Remuneration Policy will also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\n#### **2) Variable Remuneration of CEO and of the Director and General Manager**\n\nThe 2023 Remuneration Policy establishes that the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Juan Luis López García and the Director and General Manager, Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González receive an AVR, consisting of up to 200% of the FAR. The amount of this is accrued based on the fulfilment of year's targets set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position or those assigned.\n\nThe AVR is determined by the amount accrued depending on the level of fulfilment of the year's targets linked to the Group's Net Profit (hereinafter, the \"Year's Targets\") that were set taking into account the responsibilities and functions attached to the position, as well as any others that the Board of Directors may have assigned to the CEO and Director and General Manager.\n\nThe AVR is received if the Renta 4 Group's levels of delinquency or \"bad debt\" during the year are less than 5% of Net Assets at the end of the year, and when such levels do not arise as a result of actions by the Company in which the levels and limits are exceeded the Company's risk management systems, as well as any other cause attributable to a lack of action or malpractice on the part of the Company, are subject to the risk limits permitted and established by the EBA (European Banking Authority) or any other competent body for this purpose.\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. This Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\n#### **3) Variable Remuneration of the Director and Regional Manager**\n\nThe Director and Regional Director will receive an AVR, consisting of up to 200% of the FAR. The amount of this is accrued based on the fulfilment of year's targets set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position or those assigned.\n\nThe AVR will be determined by the amount corresponding to the amount accrued in accordance with the fulfilment of annual objectives linked to the Group's Net Profit (the \"Year's Targets\"), which will be set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that may be specifically assigned by the Board of Directors to the Director and Regional Director.\n\nThe AVR will be paid provided that the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the financial year are lower than 5% of the Equity at year-end and when these levels do not occur as a result of the Company's actions, in which the risk levels and limits allowed and established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) or any other competent entity are exceeded, due to deficient control systems used by the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to the Company's inaction or poor practices.\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. This Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\nOf the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration that the Executive Chairman, the CEO, the Director, and the General Manager, as well as an assessment on the Director and Regional Director would be entitled to receive, 60% shall be paid within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of March of the calendar year following the corresponding financial year in which it has accrued. The remaining 40% will be subject to a deferral period of four years, and the accrual and payment will be perfected at a maximum rate of 10% for each of the four years of deferral. The payment due must be made before the end of the month of March of the calendar year following each of the years in which the deferral has taken place. i.e.in March 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the vesting of the accrual and payment of 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, will conduct an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on keeping up the profitability of Renta 4 Group results, taking into account the sector's circumstances during the evaluation period and adapting Renta 4's activities to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the evaluation carried out on each of them concludes that their performance has been correct and aligned with the Company's objectives.\n\nAlso, if the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration is between 100% and 200% of the AUM, it will be considered as \"especially high amount\" according to letter m) of Article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of June 26, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of Credit Companies and therefore, 40% of the amount of this \"particularly high amount\" AVR shall be paid, within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of the month of March of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it was accrued. And the remaining 60% of this \"particularly high amount\" AVR will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a rate of 15% of the total of this AVR in each of the years of deferral.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nThe payment of the Total AVR will be made 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in shares, both the AVR accrued between 0% and 100% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, the payment of which is 60% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued, with 40% being spread over the following four calendar years, as in the case of the \"particularly high amount\" AVR accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the AFR, the payment of which is 40% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued, with 60% being spread over the following four calendar years at a rate of 15% per annum. To calculate the number of accrued shares to be delivered, for each payment year the share's average market value during the last 20 business days of the previous year shall be taken into consideration, the shares being non-transferable for a period of three years from delivery, unless (i) there is, at the time of transmission or financial year, a net economic exposure to a change in the share price for a market value equivalent to an amount of at least two times its annual fixed remuneration through share ownership; or (ii) in respect of shares that it needs to dispose of order to meet the costs related to their acquisition or, dependent on the prior favorable opinion of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, to meet extraordinary situations that arise and require it.\n\nTherefore, as the Group's Net Profit in 2023 was €26,127 million and the default level was less than 5% and the ESG targets have been met, consequently the level of fulfilment of the year's targets set in the 2022-2023-2024 Remuneration Policy establishes that executive directors are entitled to receive a global AVR for 2023 of a global amount of €1,190,700 for all Executive Directors. Specifically, the total AVR for the Executive Chairman for 2023 amounts to €378,000; for the CEO, €346,500; this same figure is also for the Director and General Manager, and for the Regional Director the amount is €119,700.\n\nOf the resulting total AVR for 2023, up to 100% of this amount will be paid during the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 60% will be deferred to the following four financial years; 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, with the accrual and payment being a maximum of 10% each year for the four deferred years. The annual variable remuneration accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, will be considered as \"especially high amount\" according to letter m) of article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, and 40% of the amount of this AVR of \"especially high amount\" will be paid during the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 60% of said Annual Variable Remuneration of \"especially high amount\", will be deferred in the following 4 years; 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, improving the accrual and payment at the rate of a maximum of 15% each of the four years of deferral.\n\nThe payment of the AVR, both the deferred and non-deferred part, will be paid 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares.\n\nTherefore, during the first quarter of 2024, of the resulting total AVR for 2023, the Company will pay the Executive Directors 60% up to 100% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration and 40% of the Accrued Annual Variable Remuneration which is between 100% and 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, being 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares, for a total amount of €665,280.

In this regard, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, during the first quarter of 2024, has carried out a performance assessment on the Executive Chairman, the CEO, the Director, and the General Manager, as well as an assessment on the Director and Regional Director, based on the profitability maintenance of Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the industry during the assessed period. The assessment results were positive for all of them.\n\nFor this reason, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company will pay the Executive Directors, on the one hand, the first quarter (1/4) of 40% of deferred AVR corresponding to fiscal year 2022, on the other hand, the second third (2/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to fiscal year 2021, and finally, the third and last third (3/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the fiscal year 2020, being in all cases, with 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares.\n\nSpecifically, the amount corresponding to the first quarter (1/4) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to 2022, which amounts to the total of €52,920, of which Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €16,800, 50% in cash (€8,400) and the other 50% in shares (€8,400), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €15,400, 50% in cash (€7,700) and the other 50% in shares (€7,700) and finally, Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €5,320, (€962.75) in cash and (€962.75) in shares.\n\nOn the other hand, the second third (2/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the year 2021, amounts to the total amount of €126,000, of which Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €40,000, 50% in cash (€20,000) and the other 50% in shares (€20,000), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €36,666.67, 50% in cash (€18,333.34) and the other 50% in shares (€18,333.33) and finally, Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €12,666.67, (€6,333.34) in cash and (€6,333.33) in shares.\n\nAnd finally, the total amount corresponding to the last third (3/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the fiscal year 2020 amounts to €67,833.33, of which, Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €22,000, 50% in cash (€10,000) and the other 50% in shares (€10,000), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the CEO and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €20,166.67, 50% in cash (€10,083.34) and the other 50% in shares (€10,083.33) and Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €2,521.49 (€1,260.75) in cash and (€1,260.74) in shares.\n\nConsequently, of the deferred 2021 and 2022 AVR, two quarters (2/4) of the 40% of the deferred AVR, i.e. one quarter (1/4) for each of the years, should be paid in the following years, 2025 and 2026, if the annual assessment and the results of the Company so allow it. And of the deferred 2021 AVR, one third (1/3) of the 40% of the deferred AVR will be pending payment in the following year, 2025.\n\nRegarding the decisions taken by the Board for the application of these items, the Board of Directors proceeded at its meeting of 26 February 2024, at the proposal of the ARC, to approve the Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023, to be submitted, on a consultative basis, to the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nLikewise, and taking into account the performance of the Company's activity and volume of business, the Board of Directors agreed on the variable remuneration of the executive directors for 2023, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy 2022-2023-2024, at the same above-mentioned meeting.\n\nExplain the long-term variable components of the remuneration systems:\n\n**B.8.** Indicate whether certain accrued variable components have been reduced or claimed back when, in the first case, the payment of unconsolidated amounts has been deferred or, in the second case, consolidated and paid, based on data whose accuracy has subsequently been proven to be manifestly incorrect.

Specifically, the total variable remuneration corresponding to 2019, deferred and paid in 2023 amounted to €43,166.67, with 50% paid in cash and 50% in shares. Specifically, the variable remuneration paid to Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo amounted to €14,000, to Mr. Juan Luis López García and Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González €12,833.33 each, and to Mr. Santiago González Enciso, €3,500.\n\nAnother part of the variable remuneration paid in 2023 to executive directors Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, Mr. Juan Luis López García, Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, and Mr. Santiago Gonzalez Enciso corresponds to the variable remuneration accrued in the 2020 financial year, 40% of which was deferred in thirds over the following three financial years (2022, 2023 and 2024). Specifically, the total variable remuneration for 2020, deferred and paid in 2023 amounted to €67,833.33, paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares. Specifically, the variable remuneration paid to Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo amounted to €22,000, to Mr. Juan Luis Lopez Garcia and Mr. Jesus Sanchez-Quinones González the amount of €20,166.67 to each of them, and finally to Mr. Santiago González Enciso, €5,500, in all cases, 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares.\n\nOn the other hand, of the variable remuneration paid to the executive directors during 2023, another part corresponds to the variable remuneration accrued in financial year 2021, in which it was agreed that 60% of the remuneration would be paid during the first quarter of 2022, deferring the remaining 40% over the following three years; 2023, 2024 and 2025, the amount to be paid being one third (1/3) of the total amount each year, 50% in cash and 50% in shares.

Specifically, to Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo the amount of €100,800 (€50,400 in cash and €50,400 in shares), to Mr. Juan Luis López García and to Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González the amount of €92,400 each, 50% in cash (€46,200) and 50% in shares (€46,200) and finally to Mr. Santiago González Enciso was paid €31,920, 50% in cash (€15,960) and 50% in shares. (€15,960).\n\nRegarding the VR in shares, to calculate the number of shares to be awarded in the financial year 2023, the average market value of the share during the last 20 business days of the previous year has been taken, as established in the Remuneration Policy. In the financial year 2022, the average share value over the last 20 business days was €9,715 per share. In February and March of 2023, each of the executive directors subscribed to a number of shares corresponding to the remuneration to be paid in 2023 , taking the average price (€9.715 /share) for the calculation and taking into account the interim payment associated with this remuneration in kind. In this regard, a total of 5,639 shares were subscribed to Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, 5,179 shares were subscribed to Mr. Juan Luis López García and Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, and a total of 2,199 shares were subscribed to Mr. Santiago González Enciso. The difference between the purchase price of the shares on the market and the average share price during the last 20 business days (€9.715 /share), together with the interim payment associated with the remuneration in kind, gave rise to a total additional cost of €8,309.43; €2,679.02 corresponding to Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, €2,460.52 to Mr. Juan Luis Lopez, €2,433.22 to Mr. Jesus Sánchez-Quiñones González and €736.67 correspond to Mr. Santiago González Enciso.\n\nFinally, in the GSM to be held in 2024, the Board of Directors will propose for approval a new remuneration policy for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027, in compliance with article 529 new provisions of the Capital Company Act policy which has maintained the principles, characteristics and concepts of the policies of the previous years, applicable to the Directors, both in the performance of their functions as an administrative body, as well as that of those Directors who perform executive functions.\n\nThis annual remuneration report was approved by the company's board of directors at their meeting held on session date:\n\n26\n\n#### 26/02/2024\n\nList whether any directors voted against or abstained from voting on the approval of this report.\n\nYes **No**\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/219/Picture/0 description: The image is a close-up shot of a white, textured surface, possibly paper or fabric.

It would move from a \"soft landing\" scenario to a \"no landing\" scenario.\n\n**That optimistic outlook has driven the sharp gains of the stock exchanges in the last quarter of 2023** and in the first months of 2024. Some increases that have had as main protagonists, again, the big technology companies and, in particular, those linked to generative artificial intelligence. Some of these companies have accumulated higher than 70% in just two months, after having revalued more than 200% in the previous year.\n\n**Bond markets have not shared that extreme optimism** and have performed much more moderately in the first months of this year, **which moves us to think about possible excesses** in the rises of the stock exchanges and other risky assets, such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. **Such excesses would be due, among other factors, to the abundant liquidity** that is still in the system, since only a small part of the money injected by the central banks in the wake of the pandemic has been withdrawn.\n\n**As we mentioned at last year's Shareholders' Meeting, in our opinion the global economy has entered a phase of profound transformation since 2022,** guided by four structural changes, all of which are longterm. The change of the monetary regime, abandoning the ultra-expansionary monetary policies that had dominated the scene for a decade and a half. The shift toward a growth model based on productivity rather than excessive debt accumulation. The change of geopolitical environment toward controlled deglobalisation. And, finally, the entry of the economy into a phase of permanent and transversal disruptive innovation. There are four processes of great depth, which move us to think about a period of long adjustment.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n**A period of adjustment that has not ended and that, in exchange for being long, will not be, in our opinion, traumatic, but orderly.** For the first time, central banks can aspire to deflate the economy without causing a major recession, and that is the main novelty of the post-COVID economy, an economy whose main characteristic is the profound transformation that affects all sectors, in a total and transversal way, and that determines changes in lifestyles, in business models, in the way of producing energy and even in food production systems.\n\n**From that positive long-term view, however, we do not share the optimism, in our view excessive, of thinking that the changes are over and that the economy will immediately enter a stage of high growth.** We think rather that the four processes described above will continue, because their development takes time and because the changes mentioned also require a huge volume of investment.\n\n**In this standardised context, but, I insist, not euphoric,** the role of Renta 4 Banco is more necessary than ever, because large investment processes will obtain most of the necessary financial resources through the financial markets, including the so-called private equity and direct lending markets and not through traditional bank financing, via the balance sheet, which is not designed to finance innovation. As we said last year, the financial system is evolving from a system designed to finance industrial society to a system that must finance the new knowledge society, in which the financing of innovation and transformation is absolutely key.\n\n**That is why we have strengthened and will continue to strengthen all operational areas that improve our ability to help companies** in their processes of change and transformation, presenting them with assistance and financial advice, and we will also continue to improve the access of savers to investments, with the help of new technological tools and with the permanent improvement of the quality of our human teams, which in the end are the true key to our differentiated services offered to the market.\n\n**With this philosophy of quality, but at the same time of closeness, Renta 4 Banco has once again reached historical records in 2023** both in the opening of new customer accounts and in the entry of new customer assets. The number of customers of the own network at the end of 2023 was 124,995 compared to 118,542 a year earlier, and the total assets of customers administered or managed by our Bank at the end of 2023 was €30,852 million compared to €26,370 million a year ago. The net inflow of customer assets in the year was €2,511 million, which represents a new record, surpassing the figure of 2022 that had also been record.\n\n**The financial margin** has behaved very well in 2023, totalling €23.2 million, thanks to having maintained an extremely liquid balance sheet invested in high-quality short-term monetary instruments. **The result of financial** operations, which was €10.99 million, has also performed well.\n\n**Grupo Renta 4 net profit in 2023 amounted to €26.6 million,** 21.9% higher than the previous year. It is the largest profit of Renta 4 Banco in its history, and we have achieved it by maintaining a capital ratio \"CET1 Fully Loaded\" of 18.62%, which far exceeds the level of regulatory requirement and, likewise, far exceeds that of the other banks. At the same time, the Return on Capital (ROE) in 2023 was 18.8%. This return on invested capital is well above that of the rest of Spanish and European banks. This shows that it is not incompatible to have a high capital and a high return on capital.\n\n**These high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios that allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.** Last November we distributed a dividend on account of 0.3 euros per share and today we propose to the Board, for approval, a dividend of 0.12 euros per share, that is, a total of 0.42 euros per share, what about a closing quote of 10.20 euros per share represents a dividend return for the shareholder of 4.1%.\n\n**The commercial activity continues to maintain very good levels in the first three months of 2024** and this reaffirms us in our position as a specialised bank that offers the savers a wide range of solutions to invest in a simple and profitable way their wealth, and to companies financing solutions through the financial markets and private equity and direct lending. We have a unique business model, a business model that creates value for our customers and our shareholders, and that's what sets us apart from our competitors.\n\n**We are beginning to see the first fruits of the Plus Plan,** launched two years ago, an ambitious plan aimed at offering a wider range of solutions to even wider customer segments. offering at the same time easier access to these services and solutions. The private equity offer has continued to increase, we have strengthened corporate operations teams, we have advanced interactive digital solutions and thematic investment, and we have improved and expanded banking services to our customers, to facilitate their operations. **We are aware that achieving all the objectives of the Plus Plan will take time and require a lot of effort, but I believe that we are in the right direction** and that the increase in customers and customer assets that I mentioned above are only the first fruits of that Plan, whose complete development will generate huge value for Renta 4 Banco. We are going to put the greatest effort into achieving this.\n\n**Subsidiaries in Chile, Peru and Colombia have continued to increase their activity.** Today we can say that we are already established in those three countries, where we have exceeded €10 million in revenue and €3 million in profit after tax. We expect a lot from our presence in Latin America, which, without a doubt, is one of the engines of growth of Renta 4 Banco.\n\n**We are in a very competitive sector, which is undergoing a profound transformation.** In our opinion **that transformation will not only continue, but will go further in the coming years.** We are prepared to face the changes that may come, and we will do so from a solid position of balance and from a very clear understanding of what are the main lines of evolution of our activity.\n\n**I now turn to corporate social responsibility.** Starting with job creation, the average workforce in 2022 has risen to 657 people, an increase of 3.8%. Face-to-face work in offices has now become normalised, although partial remote working has now become the norm for a large part of the workforce.\n\n**In 2023, the Renta 4 Foundation continued to support various programmes** related to the education of underprivileged and disabled people. We maintain the programs with Foundations such as A.G.H., Martinez Hermanos, Agua de Coco, Granadown, Prodis, ADF or Procivism, and we add to them the new programmes that the employees submit and vote for every year. Between direct assignment and open voting funding, there are a total of 14 solidarity projects.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 participates directly in specific actions, ensuring that they are always within the charity action area that the entity has set. Once again, a part of our staff has collaborated with various NGOs in the preparation and sending of Christmas baskets to disadvantaged families, **and in the field of culture we maintain our membership in the Board of Protectors of the Teatro Real.**\n\n**In the field of financial education we continue to hold numerous events,** courses and seminars to promote the financial culture, in which we have had more than 17,000 registered throughout the year. In addition, our blog \"From Saver to Investor\" has had more than 128,000 unique users in 2023. All this complemented with more than 145 courses and conferences that are taught in an open and free way directly in our network of offices, and with the campaign \"Investment for all\" that transposes a concept of democratization of investment and that in 2023 has exceeded 800,000 views in the main social networks.\n\nFinally, **as always and as is my duty, I would like to say thank you to** our shareholders and customers or their trust, without which none of the above would be possible, and the entire Renta 4 team for their work, dedication and enormous talent, which is undoubtedly our company's most valuable asset.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5**\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\n# **06**\n\n**Consolidated income statements of Renta 4 Banco,

(hereinafter, \"the Bank\" or \"the Parent Company\") is the entity resulting from the merger by absorption which took place on 30 March 2011, of Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión S.A., (absorbing entity) and Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (absorbed entity), previously called Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A., the change of name of the latter having been registered in the Trade Registry on 8 June 2011. In addition, in the merger process, amendments were made to the bylaws of the absorbing company, changing its name from Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión, S.A. to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and extending its corporate purpose to include banking activities, as well as investment and ancillary services typical of investment services companies. The Parent Company is registered in the Trade Registry and in the Special Register of Credit Institutions of the Bank of Spain under code 0083.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, the Directorate General of the Treasury and Financial Policy under the Ministry of Economy and Finance approved the partial spin-off of branches of activity of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores in favour of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nBy virtue of this spin-off, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores transferred to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. all of its assets and liabilities assigned to certain branches of activity of the spun-off company, which constitute \"an economic unit\" and which were transferred en bloc by universal succession to Renta 4 Banco, S.A., with this company acquiring as beneficiary of the spin-off, by universal succession, all of the assets and liabilities, rights and obligations comprising the aforementioned spun-off assets.\n\nThe balance sheet of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores as at 31 December 2010 was considered as the spin-off balance sheet. All transactions carried out by the assets spun off from Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores are considered to have been carried out for accounting purposes on behalf of Renta Banco, S.A. since 1 January 2011.\n\nAs a result of the spin-off, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, transferred net assets to Renta 4 Banco, S.A., amounting to €13.63 million, which represented 48.418% of the total net assets of Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores before the spin-off. Therefore, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores reduced its capital by the necessary amount of €2,944,826.61 by amortising shares numbered 1,047,869 to 2,031,485 inclusive.\n\nThe Parent Company's corporate purpose consists of the activities of credit institutions in general, including the provision of investment services, as well as the acquisition, holding, use, administration and disposal of all kinds of transferable securities, and in particular those determined in article 175 of the Commercial Code and other legislation in force relating to the activity of such institutions. It also includes the provision of all kinds of services and consulting, whether economic, financial, tax, stock market, organisational, mechanisation or of any other kind, and to carry out company valuation studies, as well as the placement and negotiation of securities of all kinds of movable and immovable assets belonging to third parties.\n\nThe activity or activities that constitute the corporate purpose may also be carried on by the Parent Company, wholly or partially, indirectly, through the ownership of shares or equity interests in companies with an identical or similar purpose.\n\nThe Parent Company has its registered office in Madrid, Paseo de la Habana 74. By agreement of the Administrative Body, it may be transferred within the same municipal area where it is established. Likewise, offices, agencies or delegations may be created, removed or transferred as required by the development of the company's business, both in Spain and abroad. The Parent Company's balance sheet, income statement, statement of recognised income and expenses, statement of total changes in equity and statement of cash flows as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are included in Annex IV.\n\nThe Parent Company is the head of an economic and consolidable group of credit institutions (hereinafter \"the Group\"). The activities of subsidiaries and associates are included in Annex I. During the year there have been no changes in the name of the parent company of the group.\n\nThe activities carried out by the most representative companies of the Group are regulated by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015 of 23 October, approving the revised text of the Securities Market Law, by Law 47/2007 of 19 December and by Royal Decree 217/2008 of 15 February, as well as the various Circulars of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) that implement it. The management of collective investment institutes is also regulated by Law 35/2003 of 4 November 2003 and subsequent amendments thereto, and by Royal Decree 1082/2012 of 13 July 2012, applicable as from 21 July 2012, and subsequent amendments thereto, which approves the Regulations implementing Law 35/2003 of 4 November 2003 and replaces Royal\n\nDecree 1309/2005 of 4 November 2005 by repealing it. In addition, the pension fund management activity is regulated by Royal Decree 1/2002, of 29 November, approving the revised text of the law regulating Pension Plans, implemented by Royal Decree 304/2004, of 20 February, approving the Regulations of Pension Plans and Funds and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\nAs a credit institution, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. is subject to certain legal regulations which govern, among others, aspects such as:\n\n- **a)Minimum Reserve Ratio** Maintenance of a minimum percentage of reserve holdings with a national central bank of a country participating in the single currency (euro) to cover the minimum reserve ratio. At 31 December 2023 and 2022 Renta 4 Banco, S.A. complied with the minimum requirements.\n- **b)Own Resources -** Maintenance of a minimum level of own resources. In short, the regulations stipulate the obligation to maintain sufficient own funds to cover the requirements of the risks incurred. At 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group and the Parent Company complied with the minimum requirements in this respect (see note 18.i).\n- **c) Liquidity Ratio** Article 412 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter CRR) requires compliance with the liquidity requirement, which is further developed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. This requirement applies to credit institutions at the individual level (Article 6.4 of the CRR) and at the consolidated level of the parent company (Article 11.3 of the CRR) as of 1 October 2015.\n\nIt has been adopted in accordance with the following calendar:\n\n- **• 60% of the liquidity coverage requirement as of 1 October 2015.**\n- **• 70% from 1 January 2016.**\n- **• 80% from 1 January 2017.**\n- **• 100% from 1 January 2018.**\n\nThe liquidity ratio at 31 December 2023 and 2022 of the Parent Company at individual and Group level is above 100%, which is required as of 1 January 2018.\n\n**d)Annual contribution to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (hereinafter \"DGF\") -** This represents an additional guarantee to that provided by the Bank's own resources to the Bank's creditors, the purpose of which is to guarantee customer deposits up to €100,000 in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, the Bank of Spain published Circular 5/2016 of 27 May 2016 on the calculation method for the contributions of institutions adhering to the Deposit Guarantee Fund for Credit Institutions (DGF) to be proportional to their risk profile, which will be used by the DGF's Management Committee to determine the amount of each institution's annual contributions to the deposit guarantee compartment, taking into account indicators of capital, liquidity and financing, asset quality, business model, management model and potential losses for the DGF.\n\nThe total annual contribution of all member institutions to the DGF's deposit guarantee fund has been set at 1.75 per thousand of the calculation base (1.75 of the calculation base for 2022), made up of the guaranteed money deposits as indicated in section 2.a) of Article 3 of Royal Decree 2606/1996, existing at 31 December 2022, the contribution being calculated on the basis of the amount of the guaranteed deposits and their risk profile.\n\nOn the other hand, the annual contribution of member institutions to the DGF's securities guarantee compartment has been set at 2 per thousand of the calculation basis, made up of 5% of the amount of guaranteed securities, as indicated in section 2.b) of the aforementioned article 3 of Royal Decree 2606/1996, existing at 31 December 2023.\n\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>General information\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Management Committee of the DGF had communicated the annual contribution to be made by the Bank to the Deposit Guarantee Compartment for an amount of €1,512 million (€1,243 million at 31 December 2022). The portion corresponding to the Securities Guarantee Compartment has been provisioned for €850,000 (€650,000 provisioned at 31 December 2022), recorded under \"Other operating expenses\" in the accompanying consolidated income statement. (See Note 22.c).\n\n**e)Annual contribution to the Single Resolution Fund -** The National Resolution Fund (NRF, administered by the FROB) was created in 2015 and will be financed by annual contributions from credit institutions and investment firms until it reaches at least 1% of the amount of guaranteed deposits of all institutions by 31 December 2024. This fund has been mutualised with the other euro zone member countries' funds in the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) in January 2016.\n\nOn 7 November 2015, Royal Decree 1012/2015, of 6 November, implementing Law 11/2015, of 18 June, on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment services companies, and amending Royal Decree 2606/1996, of 20 December, on deposit guarantee funds for credit institutions, was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE).\n\nIn relation to the first of the aspects developed, the Royal Decree establishes that the FROB will determine the annual contributions of institutions to the NRF annually, adjusting these contributions to the Group's risk profile.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, Regulation 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2014 entered into force, by virtue of which the Single Resolution Board replaces the National Resolution Authorities, assuming competence over the administration of the SRF as well as the calculation of the contributions to be made by the institutions, applying the calculation methodology specified in Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/63 of 21 October 2014, in accordance with the uniform conditions of application explained in Council Implementing Regulation 2015/81 of 19 December 2014.\n\nDuring the year, the Group made a contribution to the SRF in the amount of €625,000 together with the associated fees of €18,000 (€512,000 and €1,000 respectively as at 31 December 2022). These amounts have been recorded under \"Other operating expenses\" in the accompanying consolidated profit and loss statement. (See Note 22.c).\n\nSince 29 September 2007, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. has had all of its shares accepted to trading on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges. They are also included in the Spanish Stock Exchange Interconnection System.\n\n#### **Corporate transactions**\n\nOn 26 September 2019, Renta 4 Banco, S.A. reached a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. which had been operating under the trade name \"BNP Paribas Personal Investors\".\n\nThe implementation of the acquisition was approved by the Ministry of Economy on 10 March 2020.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.1 Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts (hereinafter \"Annual Accounts\") of the Group for the financial year 2023 have been prepared by the Directors of the Parent Company, at the meeting of its Board of Directors held on 26 February 2024. These consolidated financial statements are expected to be approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders without any changes. The consolidated annual accounts for 2022 of Renta 4, Banco S.A. and subsidiaries were prepared by its Directors on 21 February 2023 and approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on 30 March 2023.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002, all companies governed by the law of a Member State of the European Union whose securities are listed on a regulated market of a Member State of the European Union must present their consolidated annual accounts for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2005 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (\"EU-IFRS\").\n\nIn this regard, the Group's consolidated annual accounts for 2023 are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union and taking into consideration the provisions of Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017 and its subsequent amendments, which constitute the development and adaptation to the Spanish credit institution sector of the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union and the other provisions of the regulatory framework for financial reporting that are applicable and with the format and marking requirements established in the European Commission's Delegated Regulation EU 2019/815. There are no mandatory accounting principles or measurement bases with a material effect on these consolidated financial statements that are no longer applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements for 2023 have been prepared taking into account all the mandatory accounting policies and rules and measurement bases that have a material effect on them, so that they fairly present the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and the consolidated results of its operations and consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.\n\nNote 4 summarises the significant accounting policies and measurement bases applied in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements for 2023. Note 2.9 below provides a summary of the main accounting regulatory changes in 2023.\n\nThe figures in these consolidated annual accounts are presented in thousands of euro, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## **2.2 Comparison of information**\n\nIn accordance with commercial legislation, the directors of the Parent Company present, for comparative purposes, in addition to the figures for 2023, for each item in the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated notes to the consolidated financial statements, the figures corresponding to the previous year.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, certain amounts of the comparative figures of some breakdowns for the 2022 financial year have been reclassified with the main purpose of reflecting certain breakout balances in a manner comparable to the balances of the current financial year. This aspect does not affect any summary of the comparative financial statements for the financial year 2022.\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been prepared considering the adaptation of the content of the public financial information to the preparation criteria, terminology, definitions and formats of the statements known as FINREP which are established on a mandatory basis for the consolidated financial information prepared applying the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/214 of 16 April, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n# **2.3 Use of judgements and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts**\n\nThe information included in the consolidated annual accounts is the responsibility of the Parent Company's directors.\n\nIn preparing certain disclosures in these financial statements, the directors have made judgements and estimates based on assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income,\n\nexpenses and commitments. The most significant estimates used in the preparation of these annual accounts relate to:\n\n- · Impairment losses on financial assets (see Note 4.h).\n- · Impairment losses and the useful life of tangible assets (see Note 4.j).\n- · Impairment tests of goodwill on consolidation (see Note 4.i).\n\nThe valuation of goodwill requires estimates to be made in order to determine its fair value for the purpose of assessing possible impairment. To determine this fair value, the Parent Company's directors estimate the expected future cash flows of the cash-generating unit of which it is a part and use an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on meeting budgets for the next five years, while discount rates depend on the interest rate and risk premium associated with each cash-generating unit. Note 4.i) and 14.a) discusses the assumptions used to calculate the value in use of cash-generating units and includes an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions.\n\n· The valuation of equity instruments in share delivery plans for executives and employees (see Note 4.p).\n\n- · The fair value of certain financial assets not listed on official secondary markets (see Note 6).\n- · Measurement of the financial risks to which the Group is exposed in the course of its business (see Note 5).\n\nThe estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors that have been judged to be the most reasonable at the present time and are reviewed periodically. If, as a result of such revisions or future events, there is a change in these estimates, the effect is recognised in the consolidated income statement for that period and subsequent periods in accordance with IAS 8.\n\n# <span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>Basis of presentation\n\n# **Macroeconomic, financial and geopolitical environment**\n\nThe macroeconomic environment during 2023 has been marked, mainly, by increases in interest rates by central banks and the progressive shift of their impact on economic and financial activity. In addition, during the 2023 financial year inflation has undergone a gradual moderation since the peaks produced in the 2022 financial year.\n\nDuring recent financial years there has been a gradual return to \"normality\" in relation to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020.\n\nIn addition, the restrictive measures imposed by the EU on Russia in the wake of the Ukrainian war continue during 2023. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base by depriving it of vital technologies and markets, and significantly limiting its ability to wage war. The entity continues to strengthen internal protocols to prohibit the making available of funds or economic resources for the benefit of natural or legal persons, entities or bodies included in the EU sanctions list.\n\nFinally, geopolitical factors such as armed conflict in the Middle East, and internal political developments generate uncertainty in the economy's evolution.\n\n# **2.4 Shares in the capital of credit institutions**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group did not hold any equity interests in other domestic or foreign credit institutions.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.7 Valuation homogenisation**\n\nThe necessary valuation adjustments have been made in order to adapt the valuation criteria of the subsidiaries to those of the Parent Company.\n\n#### **2.8 Elimination of internal operations**\n\nThe various reciprocal balances for internal transactions of loans, dividends, sale and purchase of goods and services have been eliminated.\n\n#### **2.9 Regulatory developments**\n\nThe accounting principles and policies and measurement methods applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not differ significantly from those described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023.\n\nIn the financial year 2023 the following standards have come into force and have been adopted by the European Union, which have been applied by the Group for the first time:\n\n# **Rules and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter, IASB) which have entered into force in the financial year 2023**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year the following rules and interpretations adopted by the European Union, together with the respective amendments, have entered into force without significantly impacting on the Group:\n\n#### **IFRS 17 \"Insurance contracts\"**\n\nIFRS 17 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of the insurance contracts. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that entities provide relevant and reliable information about such contracts.\n\nAccording to this standard, insurance contracts combine features of financial instruments and service contracts. In addition, many insurance\n\ncontracts generate cash flows that vary substantially and have a long duration. In order to provide useful information on these issues, IFRS 17:\n\n· ombines the present measurement of future cash flows with the recognition of revenue over the period in which the contracted services are performed.\n\n· presents the results for services rendered separately from the financial expenses and income from these contracts.\n\n· requires entities to decide whether to recognise all of their financial income and expenses from insurance contracts in the profit and loss account or whether to recognise part of these results in equity.\n\nAlso, in 2020, certain amendments were made to IFRS 17 to reduce implementation costs, simplifying the requirements of this standard and facilitating the explanations to be provided in relation to the results of the operations of the entities and the transition to this new standard, deferring its effective date to 1 January 2023 and reducing the requirements for firsttime application.\n\n## **Amendment to IFRS 17 \"First-time application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9: Comparative Information\"**\n\nThis limited amendment is intended to provide insurance entities with an option for the presentation of comparative information on financial assets in order to avoid accounting mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities in this comparative information when IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 are applied for the first time.\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Paper 2 \"Disclosure of Accounting Policies\"**\n\nThese amendments are intended to help institutions improve their disclosures in relation to their accounting policies by providing more useful information in their annual accounts.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 require entities to disclose material information in relation to their accounting\n\npolicies, rather than their significant accounting policies, clarifying that accounting information relating to immaterial transactions, events or situations need not be disclosed. The amendments to Practice Paper 2 on making judgements about materiality provide guidance on how the concept of materiality should be applied to accounting policy disclosures.\n\n# **Amendments to IAS 8 \"Definition of Accounting Estimates\"**\n\nThese amendments incorporate the definition of \"accounting estimates\" as the amounts in the financial statements whose measurement is subject to uncertainty which provides guidance on how to distinguish between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies. This distinction is relevant because changes in accounting estimates are recorded prospectively whereas changes in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively. In particular, it is clarified that changes in accounting estimates as a result of new information or developments are not treated as corrections of prior period errors.\n\n# **Amendments to IAS 12 \"Deferred Taxation Relating to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\"**\n\nCommission REGULATION (EU) 2022/1392 of 11 August 2022 amending Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 as regards IAS 12. Clarifications on exceptions to the initial recognition of assets or liabilities are not applicable where there are temporary taxable and deductible differences of the same amount.\n\n# **Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are no longer in effect**\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the most significant standards and interpretations that have been issued by the IASB but not applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, either because their effective date is subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements or because they have not yet been adopted by the European Union, are as follows:\n\n#### **2.5 Consolidation methods**\n\nThe Group classifies its investments in subsidiaries or associates according to the following criteria:\n\n· Subsidiaries are defined as entities over which the Group has control. An entity controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nTo be considered dependent, the following must be true:\n\n- **a.Poder: Power:** An investor has power over an investee when the investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. activities that significantly affect the investee's returns;\n- **b.Yields:** An investor is exposed, or entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with an investee when the returns to the investor from that involvement may vary depending on the economic performance of the investee. The investor's returns can be positive only, negative only or both positive and negative.\n- **c. Relationship between power and yield:** An investor controls an investee if the investor not only has power over the investee and is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, but also has the ability to use its power to affect the returns it earns from its involvement with the investee.\n\nSubsidiaries have been fully consolidated by the full consolidation method, which consists of the inclusion in the Group's balance sheet of all the rights and obligations comprising the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries, and in the income statement of all the income and expenses which contribute to the determination of their profit or loss for the year.\n\nLikewise, consolidation ceases when the Group loses control. When this situation arises, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the part of the year during which the Group retained control over them.\n\n· Associates are companies over which the Group has the capacity to exercise significant influence, based on the presence in their governing bodies, on the effective capacity to influence their strategic and operating policies and the existence of significant transactions. Associated entities have been consolidated using the equity method (also known as the \"equity consolidation method\"), whereby the book value of the investment is replaced by the amount corresponding to the percentage of the associated entity's equity.\n\n#### **2.6 Minority interests**\n\nThe value of the minority interests in the equity and results of consolidated subsidiaries is presented under \"Minority interests\" in the consolidated balance sheets and \"Profit for the year - Attributable to minority interests\" in the consolidated profit and loss statements and the consolidated statements of recognised income and expense, respectively.\n\nOn acquisitions of interests from external partners, the difference between the price paid and the amount recorded is recorded in equity attributable to the Parent Company.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Approved for EU application:**\n\n## **Amendments to IFRS 16 \"Lease liabilities on sale and leaseback transactions\"**\n\nComes into force from 1 January 2024 by Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/2579 of 20 November 2023 amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1803 as regards IFRS 16.\n\nThe application of the amendments to IFRS 16 shall be retrospective and early application is permitted.\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\"**\n\nComes into force from 1 January 2024, retroactively.\n\n#### **Not approved for EU application**\n\n## **Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 \"Supplier Financing Agreements\"**\n\nEarly implementation of these amendments is permitted. If they are applied to a period prior to the date of mandatory application, this should be broken down.\n\n#### **Amendments to IAS 21 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\"**\n\nEarly implementation of these amendments is permitted. If they are applied to a period prior to the date of mandatory application, this should be broken down\n\nThe group has assessed the impacts of these standards and has decided, where possible, not to exercise early application. It is also estimated that the adoption of the non-current amendments issued by the IASB will not have a significant impact on the Group.\n\n#### **2.10 Distribution of profits**\n\nThe distribution of profit for 2023 and 2022 is made in accordance with the proposed distribution of profit included in the annual accounts of the respective Group companies prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the countries in which they are located.\n\nThe proposed distribution of the Parent Company's profit for 2023 (determined in accordance with accounting principles and criteria generally accepted in Spain), formulated by the Directors and pending approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting, is as follows, as well as the distribution of the Parent Company's profit approved for 2022:\n\n|                                                | Thousands of Euro |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|\n|                                                | 2023              | 2022   |\n| Reserves                                       | 8,658             | 10,039 |\n| Interim dividend (Note 18.g)                   | 12,208            | 10,155 |\n| To complementary interim dividends (Note 18.g) | 4,883             | 2,031  |\n| Total distributed                              | 25,749            | 22,225 |\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe subsidiaries and associates of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. on 31 December 2023 and 2022 are listed in Annex I. Information on the accounting of associates in the consolidation process is provided in Note 12.\n\nThe individual financial statements of the companies comprising the Group used in the consolidation process for 2023 and 2022 were those as on 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Group classifies its holdings in subsidiaries or associates in accordance with the criteria set out in section 2.5.\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, the changes in \"Group companies\" were as follows:\n\n· On 27 January 2023, the companies of Grupo Carterix S.A., Sociedad de Estudios e Inversiones S.A., Renta 4 Vizcaya S.A. and Rentsegur Correduria de Seguros S.A. were dissolved and liquidated\n\n· On 16 May 2023, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Corporación Financiera Renta 4 S.C.R., S.A., agreed to make a non-refundable cash capital contribution of €1.9 million.\n\n· On 11 October 2023, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Corporación Financiera Renta 4 S.C.R., S.A., has agreed to make a non-refundable cash capital contribution of €250,000.\n\n· On 28 November 2023, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Corporación Financiera Renta 4 S.C.R., S.A., has agreed to make a non-refundable cash capital contribution of €300,000.\n\n# <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>Group Companies and Associates\n\n· On 18 December 2023, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Corporación Financiera Renta 4 S.C.R., S.A., has agreed to make a non-refundable cash capital contribution of €400,000.\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, the changes in \"Group companies\" were as follows:\n\n· On 16 June 2023, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., has authorised the capital increase of the company Valor Absoluta Asset Manegement S.A. through the subscription of 44,118 new shares, with a nominal value of €1 each, plus an issue premium for a total amount of €4.044 million. The payment of the shares, as well as the entire issue premium, has been fully subscribed and paid up through cash contribution.\n\n· On 15 June 2023, the company Openbrick SL was constituted. The share capital is three thousand Euros represented by three thousand shares,\n\nnumbered from one to three thousand, with a nominal value of one Euro each. Renta 4 Banco, S.A., has agreed to make a cash contribution, fully subscribed for the amount of €1,000.\n\n· On 31 July 2023, the shareholders' meeting of the entity Openbrick, S.L., has agreed a capital increase of two Euro, through the issuance of two shareholdings of one Euro of nominal value each, with an issue premium of €99,000.\n\n· On 2 October 2023, the shareholders' meeting of the entity Openbrick, S.L., has agreed a capital increase of two Euros, by issuing two shares each with a nominal value of one Euro with an issue premium of €100,000.\n\n· On 27 July 2023, 70,000 shares of Torsa Capital S.G.E.I.C., S.A. were acquired, representing 23.33% of the company's capital, for a total price of €263,000. On 15 December 2023, 20,000\n\nmore shares were acquired for an amount of €20,000, reaching a percentage of participation in company's capital of 30%.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, the changes in \"Group companies\" were as follows:\n\n· On 25 May 2022, Renta 4 Banco, S.A., in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Corporación Financiera Renta 4 S.C.R., S.A., has agreed to make a non-refundable cash capital contribution of €2 million.\n\n· On 5 December 2022, the General Shareholders' Meeting of Renta 4 Huesca approved the shareholders' contribution to the company's equity in the amount of €10,000.\n\nDetails of the subsidiaries and associates of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. on 31 December 2023 and 2022 are shown in Annex I of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following accounting principles and policies and measurement bases have been applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2023:\n\n#### **a) Going concern principle**\n\nThe information contained in these financial statements has been prepared on the assumption that the Group will continue to be managed in the future and, accordingly, the accounting policies have not been applied for the purpose of determining the value of the net assets for the purposes of their global or partial transfer or for a hypothetical liquidation, as the directors consider that the Group will continue to operate as usual.\n\n## **b) Accrual principle**\n\nThese consolidated financial statements, except for the cash flow statements, have been prepared on the basis of the actual flow of goods and services, irrespective of the date of payment or collection.\n\n#### **c) Clearing of balances**\n\nOnly balances receivable and payable arising from transactions which are contractually or legally offset and which are intended to be settled on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously are offset and are therefore presented on the consolidated balance sheet at their net amount. For these purposes, the presentation in accordance with EU-IFRS in these consolidated financial statements of financial assets subject to impairment or depreciation adjustments, net of these items, is not considered to be a \"compensation of balances\".\n\n## **d) Foreign currency transactions**\n\nFor the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, the functional and presentation currency is the euro, and so \"foreign currency\" is considered to be any currency other than the euro.\n\nOn initial recognition, foreign currency receivables and payables have been translated into euro using the spot exchange rate. After that time, the following rules apply for the conversion of balances denominated in foreign currencies into euro:\n\n· Monetary assets and liabilities have been translated into euro using the average official spot exchange rates published by the European Central Bank at the end of each year.\n\n· Income and expenses have been translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of foreign currency balances are recorded in the consolidated profit and loss account.\n\nAt year-end 2023, the total amount of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies amounted to €112.419 million and €98.302 million, respectively. At year-end 2022, the total amount of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies amounted to €112.882 million and €136.948 million, respectively.\n\n#### **e) Revenue recognition**\n\nAs a general rule, revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, less any trade discounts, rebates or discounts. When the cash inflow is deferred in time, fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows.\n\nThe recognition of any income in the consolidated income statement or in consolidated equity is subject to the following conditions:\n\n- · Their amount can be reliably estimated.\n- · It is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity.\n- · The information is verifiable.\n\nWhen doubt arises regarding the collectability of an amount previously recognised in income, the amount that is no longer likely to be collectible is recognised as an expense rather than as a reduction in income.\n\n#### **Interest, dividends and similar income and expense**\n\nInterest income, interest expense and similar items are generally recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.\n\nInterest shall be recognised in the profit and loss account on the basis of the following criteria, irrespective of the portfolio in which the assets are classified:\n\n- · Interest due before the date of initial recognition and receivable shall form part of the carrying amount of the debt instrument.\n- · Interest accrued after initial recognition of a debt instrument shall be incorporated, until collected, in the gross carrying amount of the instrument.\n\nDividends received from companies other than those included in the Group's scope of consolidation are recognised as income when the consolidated entities' right to receive them arises.\n\nWhen a debt instrument is considered impaired, interest income is recorded by applying to the carrying amount of the asset the interest rate used to discount the cash flows expected to be recovered.\n\n#### **Commissions, fees and similar items**\n\nFee and commission income and expenses that are not to be included in the calculation of the effective interest rate of transactions and/or are not included in the acquisition cost of financial assets or liabilities other than those classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to their nature.\n\nThe most significant of these are:\n\n· Those linked to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognised in the income statement upon collection/payment.\n\n· Those arising from transactions or services that continue over time, which are accounted for in the consolidated income statement over the life of such transactions or services.\n\n· Those relating to a single act, which are taken to the income statement when the act giving rise to them occurs.\n\n#### **Non-financial income and expenses**\n\nThey are recognised on an accruals basis.\n\n#### *Collections and payments deferred over time*\n\nThey are recognised for accounting purposes at the amount resulting from discounting the expected cash flows at market rates.\n\n## **f) Recognition, measurement and classification of financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and, simultaneously, a financial liability or equity instrument in another entity.\n\nFinancial instruments are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contract in accordance with the contract specifications. The Group recognises debt instruments, such as loans and cash deposits, from the date on which the legal right to receive, or the legal obligation to pay, cash arises and financial derivatives from the trade date. In addition, transactions in the foreign exchange market are recorded on the settlement date, and financial assets traded on the Spanish secondary securities markets are recognised on the trade date in the case of equity instruments and on the settlement date in the case of debt securities.\n\n## **f.1 Financial assets**\n\n#### *Classification of financial assets*\n\nIFRS 9 contains three main classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n# <span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>Accounting Principles and Assessment Criteria Applied\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *\"Financial assets held for trading\" and \"Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\":*\n\n\"Financial assets held for trading\" shall include financial assets whose business model is to generate profits by making purchases and sales or to generate profits in the short term. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss shall be classified under \"Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\" whenever the entity's business model for managing them or the characteristics of their contractual cash flows make it inappropriate to classify them in any of the other portfolios described above.\n\nThe assets recognised under these headings in the consolidated balance sheets are measured after acquisition at fair value and changes in their value (gains or losses) are recognised net under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net\" and \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement, except for interest on derivatives designated as economic and accounting interest rate hedges, which are recognised under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" in the consolidated income statement, net\" in the consolidated income statement, except for interest relating to derivatives designated as economic and accounting hedges on interest rates, which is recorded under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a), depending on where the results of the hedged instrument are recorded. However, changes arising from exchange differences are recorded under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.a).\n\n#### *\"Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\"*\n\n#### · **Debt financial instruments:**\n\nAssets recorded under this balance sheet heading are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in this valuation (gains or losses) are recognised temporarily, at their amount (net of the related tax effect), under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\"\n\nin the balance sheet. The amounts recorded under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" and \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Foreign currency translation\" continue to form part of the Bank's equity until the asset in which they arise is cancelled or until it is determined that the financial instrument is impaired. If these assets are sold, the amounts are written off with a balancing entry under \"Gains or losses on cancellation of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss, net\" or \"Exchange differences, net\", as appropriate, in the income statement for the period in which the cancellation occurs. In addition, net impairment losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income arising in the year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" in the income statement for the year (see Note 22.f). Currency differences arising from monetary items are recorded under \"Currency differences, net\" in the income statement (see Note 22.g).\n\nIn addition, net impairment losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in the year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss and net gains or losses on modification - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" in the consolidated income statement for the year (see Note 22.f).\n\nExchange differences arising from monetary items are recorded under \"Exchange differences, net\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.g).\n\n#### · **Equity financial instruments:**\n\nOn initial recognition of specific investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. Subsequent changes in this valuation shall be recognised in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items not to be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\".\n\n#### *\"Financial assets at amortised cost\"*\n\nA financial instrument shall be classified in the amortised cost portfolio when it is managed under a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets to receive contractual cash flows, and it meets the PIO test.\n\nAssets recognised under this heading in the consolidated balance sheets are measured subsequent to acquisition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\nNet impairment losses on assets recognised in these captions occurring in each year are recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - Financial assets at amortised cost\" in the consolidated income statement for that period (see Note 22.f).\n\nImpairment losses on financial instruments are recognised in accordance with Note 4.h).\n\n#### **f.2) Financial liabilities**\n\n#### **Classification of financial liabilities**\n\nUnder IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified into the following categories:\n\n· Financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n· Financial liabilities held for trading (including derivatives): these are instruments that are recorded in this category when the Group's objective is to generate profits through purchases and sales of these instruments;\n\n· Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition (fair value option). The Group has the option to irrevocably designate a financial liability as measured at fair value through profit or loss if the application of\n\nThe classification of financial instruments into an amortised cost or fair value category has to pass two tests: the business model and the contractual cash flow assessment, commonly referred to as the \"principal and interest only approach\" (hereinafter PIO).\n\nA financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n· The financial asset is held under a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to earn contractual cash flows; and\n\n· The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, essentially understood as compensation for the time value of money and the debtor's credit risk.\n\nA financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n· The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by earning contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n\n· The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, at specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nA debt financial instrument shall be classified at fair value through profit or loss whenever the entity's business model for managing it or the characteristics of its contractual cash flows make it inappropriate to classify it in any of the other portfolios described.\n\nIn general, equity financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, the Group may irrevocably elect, at the time of initial recognition, to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial assets will only be reclassified when the Group decides to change the business model. In this case, all financial assets of that business model shall be reclassified. The change in business model objective must be prior to the reclassification date.\n\n#### **Valuation of financial assets**\n\nAll financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of financial instruments that are not classified at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the instruments.\n\nExcept for trading derivatives that are not economic and accounting hedges, all changes in the value of financial assets arising from the accrual of interest and similar items are recognised under \"Interest income\" in the consolidated income statement for the period in which the accrual occurs (see Note 22.a). Dividends received from companies other than subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are recognised under \"Dividend income\" in the consolidated income statement for the period in which the right to receive them arises.\n\nChanges in valuations occurring after initial recognition for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated as described below, depending on the categories in which the financial assets are classified.\n\nIts financial assets are classified into the following portfolios for valuation purposes:\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nthis criterion eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies, or if it is a group of financial liabilities, or a group of financial assets and financial liabilities, that is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in line with a risk management or investment strategy.\n\n#### **Valuation of financial liabilities**\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of financial instruments that are not classified at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the instruments.\n\nChanges in valuations occurring after initial recognition for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated as described below, depending on the categories in which the financial liabilities are classified:\n\n## *\"Financial liabilities held for trading\" and \"Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\"*\n\nThe liabilities recognised under these headings in the consolidated balance sheets are measured after recognition at fair value and changes in their value (gains or losses) are recognised, at their net amount, under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net\" and \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement (see \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net\" in the consolidated income statement) Note 22.f), except for interest on derivatives designated as economic and accounting hedges on interest rates, which is recorded under \"Interest income\" or \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a), depending on where the results of the hedged instrument are recorded. However, changes arising from exchange differences are recorded under \"Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 22.a).\n\n#### *\"Financial liabilities at amortised cost\"*\n\nThe liabilities under this heading in the consolidated balance sheets are measured subsequent to acquisition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\n#### **f.3) Gains and losses on financial instruments**\n\nGains and losses on financial instruments are recorded depending on the portfolio in which they are classified according to the following criteria:\n\n· For financial instruments included in the \"Held for trading\" category, changes in fair value are recognised directly in the profit and loss account.\n\n· For financial instruments measured at amortised cost, changes in their fair value are recognised when the financial instrument is cancelled and, in the case of financial assets, when they become impaired.\n\n· For financial instruments included in the category \"Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income\", changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, as \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive\n\nincome\", until cancellation, when the existing amount is transferred to the income statement. Impairment losses, if any, are recognised in the profit and loss account, and as \"Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items not to be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\".\n\n#### **f.4) Fair value and amortised cost of financial instruments**\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument on a specified date is the amount for which it could be bought or sold on that date between two knowledgeable, willing parties in a mutually independent transaction. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it in an organised, transparent and deep market (\"quoted price\" or \"market price\").\n\nWhen a market publishes bid and demand prices for the same instrument, the market price for an asset to be acquired or a liability to be issued is the bid price (demand), while the price for an asset to be acquired or a liability to be issued is the ask price (bid). In case there is relevant market making activity or it can be demonstrated that positions can be closed out liquidated or hedged - at the mid-price, then the midprice is used. When there is no market price for a given financial instrument, its fair value is estimated on the basis of the price established in recent transactions involving similar instruments or, failing that, on the basis of valuation models sufficiently tested by the financial community, taking into account the specific characteristics of the instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with the instrument.\n\nValuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument meet the following requirements:\n\n· The most consistent and appropriate financial and economic methods are used, which have been shown to provide the most realistic estimate of the price of the financial instrument.\n\n· These are those commonly used by market participants when valuing that type of financial instrument, such as discounted cash flow,\n\ncondition-based option pricing models, nonarbitrage, etc.\n\n· They maximise the use of available information, both in terms of observable data and recent transactions with similar characteristics, and limit the use of unobservable data and estimates as much as possible.\n\n· They are comprehensively and sufficiently documented, including the reasons for their choice over other possible alternatives.\n\n· The chosen valuation methods are respected over time, as long as there are no reasons that change the reasons for their choice.\n\n· The validity of valuation models is regularly assessed using recent transactions and current market data.\n\nThey take into account the following factors: time value of money, credit risk, exchange rate, commodity price, price of equity instruments, volatility, market liquidity, risk of early termination and administration costs.\n\nSpecifically, the fair value of financial derivatives traded on organised, transparent and deep markets included in the trading portfolios is assimilated to their daily quotation and if, for exceptional reasons, their quotation cannot be established on a given date, they are valued using methods similar to those used to value derivatives not traded on organised markets.\n\nThe fair value of OTC derivatives or derivatives traded on shallow or transparent organised markets is taken to be the sum of the future cash flows arising from the instrument, discounted to present value at the date of valuation (\"present value\" or \"theoretical close\"), using methods recognised by the financial markets in the valuation process: \"net present value (NPV)\", option pricing models, etc.\n\nAmortised cost means the acquisition cost of a financial asset or liability plus or minus, as appropriate, principal and interest repayments and plus or minus, as appropriate, the portion taken to the consolidated profit and loss account, using the effective interest method, of the difference between the initial amount and the redemption value of such financial instruments. In the case of financial assets, the amortised cost also includes impairment losses.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the discount rate that exactly matches the initial value of a financial instrument to all of its estimated cash flows from all sources over its remaining life, without regard to future credit risk losses. For fixed-rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate coincides with the contractual interest rate established at the time of acquisition, adjusted, where applicable, for any fees and transaction costs that, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, must be included in the calculation of the effective interest rate. For floating rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate is estimated in a manner similar to that for fixed rate transactions and is recalculated at each contractual interest rate reset date on the basis of changes in the future cash flows of the transaction.\n\n#### **g) Reclassifications between portfolios**\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting on 21 February 2023 decided to formulate the Annual Accounts without effecting the reclassification agreed at the meeting on 28 June 2022 of a debt item in the nominal amount of €310 million from the category \"Financial assets at fair value through equity\" to the category \"Financial assets at amortised cost\".\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, the Group has not done any reclassifications between portfolios.\n\n#### **h) Impairment of financial assets**\n\nA financial asset is considered impaired - and, consequently, its carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the effect of its impairment - when there is objective evidence that events have occurred that give rise to:\n\n**1.** A negative effect on future cash flows that were estimated at the time the transaction was entered into, in the case of debt instruments (loans and debt securities).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.** In the case of equity instruments, their carrying amount cannot be recovered in full.\n\nAs a general rule, the carrying amount of impaired financial instruments is adjusted for impairment with a charge to the income statement for the year in which the impairment becomes evident. Reversals of previously recognised impairment losses, if any, are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is reversed or reduced.\n\nWhen the recovery of any amount recorded is considered remote, it is removed from the balance sheet, without prejudice to any action that the Bank may take to seek collection until its rights have been definitively extinguished, whether by lapse of time, forgiveness or other causes.\n\nThe criteria applied by the Group to determine possible impairment losses on each category of financial instruments and the method used to calculate the hedges recognised for impairment are set out below.\n\nThe \"expected loss\" impairment model is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments; and to financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments unilaterally revocable by the Group.\n\nSimilarly, all financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are excluded from the impairment model.\n\nThe standard classifies financial instruments into three categories, depending on the evolution of their credit risk since initial recognition. The first category comprises transactions when initially recognised (Stage 1), the second category comprises transactions for which a significant increase in credit risk has been identified since initial recognition (Stage 2) and the third category comprises impaired transactions (Stage 3)\n\n#### **Definition of impaired financial assets**\n\nThe \"expected loss\" impairment model is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments; and to financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments.\n\nIFRS 9 differentiates between the following expected loss concepts:\n\n- · 12-month expected loss: these are the expected credit losses resulting from possible events of default within 12 months after the reporting date; and\n- · Expected loss over the duration of the entire transaction: the expected credit losses resulting from all possible events of default during the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\nThe estimate of expected loss over the duration of the entire transaction is applied if the credit risk of a financial asset at the reporting date has increased significantly since initial recognition and the 12-month expected loss measurement is applied if it has not.\n\nThe Group considers the following definitions:\n\n#### **1. Non-compliance:**\n\nThe Group applies a definition of default for financial instruments that is consistent with that used in internal credit risk management, as well as with the indicators set out in the applicable banking regulations. Both qualitative and quantitative indicators are considered.\n\nThe Group considers a default to exist when one of the following situations occurs:\n\n- · a default of more than 90 days; or\n- · there is reasonable doubt about the full repayment of the instrument.\n\nThe 90-day default is a presumption that can be rebutted in cases where the entity believes, based on reasonable and documented information, that a longer period is appropriate. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has not used terms longer than 90 days for any of the significant portfolios.\n\nThis definition is consistently applied throughout the Group.\n\n#### **2. Impaired financial assets:**\n\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset. Observable data on the following events are evidence that a financial asset is impaired:\n\n- · significant financial difficulties of the issuer or the borrower.\n- · non-compliance with contractual clauses, such as non-payment or an event of default.\n- · concessions or advantages that the lender, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, has granted to the borrower that it would not otherwise have provided.\n- · increasing likelihood that the borrower will enter\n\n#### bankruptcy or other financial restructuring.\n\n- · the disappearance of an active market for the financial asset in question due to financial difficulties, or\n- · the purchase or creation of a financial asset at a deep discount reflecting the credit loss incurred.\n- It may not be possible to identify a single specific event, but rather the combined effect of several events may have caused the financial asset to become credit-impaired.\n\nThe Group's definition of an impaired financial asset is aligned with the definition of default described in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n#### **3. Significant increase in credit risk:**\n\nThe objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition considering all reasonable and documented information, including forward-looking information.\n\nThe model developed by the Group, which consists of the assessment of qualitative factors (triggers, refinancing, macroeconomic information, etc.) and, in some cases, quantitative factors for the assessment of significant increases in credit risk, has a two-pronged approach that is applied globally.\n\nIn any case, instruments are considered as Stage-2 (see below) if any of the following circumstances apply:\n\n- · Non-payment of more than 30 days that are subject to special surveillance by the Risk units because they show negative signals in their credit quality, although there is no objective evidence of impairment.\n- · Refinancing or restructuring that do not show evidence of impairment.\n\nThe standard introduces a number of operational simplifications/practical solutions for the analysis of significant risk enhancement for certain high credit quality assets. The Group uses this possibility provided by the standard to directly consider that their credit risk has not increased significantly because they have a low credit risk at the reporting date.\n\nTherefore, the classification of financial instruments subject to impairment under the new IFRS 9 will be as follows:\n\n· **Stage-1:** No significant increase in impairment: The allowance for losses on these financial instruments is calculated as the expected credit losses over the following twelve months.\n\n· **Stage-2:** Significant increase in impairment: When the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment loss on that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss over the duration of the asset.\n\n· **Stage-3:** Impaired: When there is objective evidence that the financial asset is impaired, it is transferred to this category in which the impairment loss on that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss over the life of the asset.\n\n#### **Methodology for calculating expected losses**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the estimate of expected losses should reflect:\n\n- · a weighted and unbiased amount determined by assessing a range of possible outcomes.\n- · the value of the money over time.\n\n· reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue effort or cost and that reflects both current conditions and predictions of future conditions.\n\nThe Group estimates expected losses both individually and collectively.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe objective of the Group's individual estimate is to estimate expected losses for significant impaired or Stage 2 risks. In these cases, the amount of credit losses is calculated as the difference between the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the transaction and the carrying amount of the instrument.\n\nFor the collective estimation of expected losses, instruments are grouped into asset pools based on their risk characteristics. Exposures within each group are segmented according to common credit risk characteristics, such as credit risk grade; geographic region; sector for corporates; default status; and product type for individuals. In the case of collective measurement, the Group estimates the cash flows it expects to receive as the sum of the marginal losses occurring in each period and over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\nIf the risk has increased significantly since origination, expected losses are measured over the remaining life of the instrument, otherwise expected losses are measured over the next 12 months.\n\nMarginal losses are derived from the following parameters:\n\n· **PD:** estimated probability of default in each period\n\n· **EAD:** estimated exposure at default in each future period, taking into account changes in exposure after the reporting date, including prepayments.\n\n· **LGD:** estimated loss in case of default, as the difference between the contractual cash flows and those expected to be received, including collateral.\n\nFor debt securities, the Group monitors changes in credit risk by monitoring published external credit ratings.\n\n#### **Use of present, past and future information**\n\nIFRS 9 requires the incorporation of present, past and future information for both the detection of the significant increase in risk and the measurement of expected losses.\n\nIn estimating expected losses, the standard does not require the identification of all possible scenarios. However, the probability of a loss event occurring and the probability of it not occurring must be considered, even if the chance of a loss occurring is very small. Also, where there is no linear relationship between different future economic scenarios and their associated expected losses, more than one future economic scenario should be used for estimation.\n\n#### **Hedge accounting**\n\nThe Group currently has no hedge accounting.\n\n#### **i) Goodwill and other intangible assets**\n\n#### **Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of business combinations over the fair value of their net assets acquired at the acquisition date.\n\nWhen the acquisition is made with deferred payment, the acquisition price corresponds to the present value of the deferred payment.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Any impairment arising is recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss account and may not be reversed in the future.\n\nFor the impairment calculation, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and its recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, it is considered to be impaired and the carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount. Goodwill impairment losses recognised are not reversed in subsequent years (Note 14).\n\nTo estimate value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the investment.\n\nIn the event of the disposal or sale of a subsidiary or associate, the goodwill attributed to that company, if any, is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n#### **Other intangible assets**\n\nThe Group recognised its computer software and the \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition in December 2006 of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. as \"Other intangible assets\", S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. In addition, the Group recorded the \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa and the acquisition of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. in 2020 (see Note 14).\n\nComputer software includes amounts paid for access to ownership or for the right to use software. The maintenance costs of these computer applications are charged directly as expenses in the year in which they are incurred.\n\nThey are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three years from the moment the use of the corresponding software application begins.\n\nThe \"Customer relationships\" acquired from the acquisition in December 2006 of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.A. were amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years (useful life), which is the period of time that management estimated that these relationships would be maintained based on the information available. As at 31 December 2014, these \"Customer relationships\" were fully amortised. The \"Customer Relations\" resulting from the acquisition in 2012 of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. were amortised on a straight-line basis\n\nover a period of 7 years (useful life), which is the length of time that management estimated these relationships would be maintained, based on available historical information. As at 31 December 2019, these customer relationships were fully amortised. In addition, \"Customer relationships\" from the acquisition in 2020 of the brokerage, fund marketing and custody business of BNP Paribas Sucursal en España, S.A. (see Note 1) are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 14 years (useful life), which is the length of time that management has calculated that these relationships will be maintained based on available information.\n\n## **j) Tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are classified according to their intended use as: tangible assets for own use, investment property and other assets leased out under operating leases.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment for own use are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any impairment losses. This heading covers assets, both owned and leased (right of use), which the Bank holds for current or future use and which it expects to use for more than one financial year. It also includes tangible assets received by the Bank in full or partial settlement of financial assets which represent receivables from third parties and which are expected to be used on an ongoing basis.\n\nFor further information on the accounting treatment of rights of use under leases, see Note 4.v.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditure incurred both initially on acquisition and production and subsequently on expansion, replacement or improvement when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow from their use.\n\nUpkeep and maintenance expenses, which do not increase the useful life of the asset, are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group considered the acquisition cost at the date of transition to EU-IFRS (1 January 2005) to be the carrying amount recorded under Spanish GAAP at 1 January 2005.\n\nInvestment property reflects the net book value of a building (including land) held for rental purposes.\n\nThe acquisition or production cost of tangible assets, net of their residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the years of estimated useful life of the various assets, as follows:\n\nMaterial assets are cancelled when they are disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected to arise from their disposal, sale or abandonment. The difference between the amount of the sale and its carrying amount is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss account in the period in which the asset is cancelled.\n\nThe Group periodically assesses whether there are indications, both internally and externally, that any tangible assets may be impaired at the reporting date. For those assets identified, it estimates the recoverable amount of the tangible asset as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount so determined is less than the carrying amount, the difference between the two is recognised in profit or loss and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.\n\n#### **k) Cash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits**\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and balances on demand with financial intermediaries.\n\n#### **l) Treasury shares and convertible shares**\n\nThe Parent Company shares held by the Group are accounted for as a reduction of consolidated equity.\n\nNo gain or loss is recognised in consolidated profit or loss for the year arising from treasury share transactions, which is recognised directly in consolidated equity. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised under \"Share premium\".\n\nConvertible shares are separated between the liability and equity component based on the terms of the contract. On the issue of convertible shares, the fair value of the liability component is determined using the market rate of an equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until extinguished through conversion or settlement. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in the net equity. Transaction costs are deducted from equity, net of the associated income tax. The carrying amount of the conversion option is not revalued in subsequent periods. Transaction costs of the convertible preference shares are allocated between the liability and equity components on the basis of the allocation made of the amount realised between the liability and equity components at initial recognition of the instrument.\n\n#### **m) Provisions**\n\nObligations existing at the consolidated balance sheet date arising from past events which could give rise to a loss for the Group, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as provisions at the present value of the most probable amount that the Group expects to have to pay to settle the obligation. Provisions are quantified on the basis of the best information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated annual accounts on the consequences of the event giving rise to them and are re-estimated at each balance sheet date.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022, the provisions reflected in the consolidated balance sheet mainly cover certain risks arising from the development of its activity and risks from claims by third parties of the Parent Company and other subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities recorded in a business combination**\n\nContingent liabilities recognised in a business combination are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the recognition criteria for provisions, noted above, or the amount initially recognised less, where applicable, accumulated amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\nThe allocation and release of provisions deemed necessary in accordance with the above criteria are recognised with a charge or credit, respectively, to \"Provisions (net)\" in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### **n) Income tax**\n\nThe income tax expense is determined by the tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year, after taking into account changes during the year arising from temporary differences, tax credits, tax relief and negative tax base.\n\nThe income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement except when the transaction is recognised directly in equity and in business combinations where the deferred tax is recognised as an equity item.\n\nIn order for tax credits, tax relief and negative tax bases to be effective, the requirements established in current legislation must be met, provided that their recovery is probable, either because there are sufficient deferred tax liabilities or because they have arisen due to specific situations that are considered unlikely to occur in the future.\n\nThe tax effect of temporary differences is included, where applicable, in the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities under \"Tax assets\" and \"Tax liabilities\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAt least at the end of each year, the Group reviews the deferred tax assets recognised and makes appropriate valuation adjustments if the deferred tax assets are no longer current or can be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the effective tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised or the liabilities are settled, based on tax rates (and tax legislation) enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **o) Commissions**\n\nThis heading includes brokerage, asset management, custody and other revenues related to the Group's activities (underwriting, placement, etc.). This revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement as the service is rendered or, in the case of a service that is performed in a single act, at the time the service is performed.\n\n## **p) Staff costs**\n\n#### **Short-term remuneration**\n\nThis type of remuneration is valued, without discounting, at the amount to be paid for the services received, and is generally recorded as personnel expenses for the year and as an accrual for the difference between the total expense and the amount already paid.\n\n#### **Other staff remuneration**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Bank has not granted loans to its employees for the acquisition of shares of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has granted personal loans to several of its employees to cover their personal and/or family needs as set out in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements amounting to €927,000 unsecured (€739,000 in 2022), in compliance with the conditions established therein, having granted such financing at zero interest rate.\n\n|                                   | Years of useful life | Depreciation<br>percentages used |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Buildings and other constructions | 50                   | 2 %                              |\n| Investment properties             |                      |                                  |\n| Building                          | 50                   | 2 %                              |\n| Facilities                        | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Machinery, plant and tools        | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Furniture and furnishings         | 10                   | 10 %                             |\n| Transport elements                | 6.25                 | 16 %                             |\n| Information processing equipment  | 4                    | 25 %                             |\n| Other fixed assets                | 5                    | 20 %                             |\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe difference between the present value of the payments to be made by the employee and the fair value is recorded in the consolidated profit and loss account as a personnel expense.\n\nThe amount recognised in the consolidated income statement for zero interest loans amounted to €44,000 of expense for 2023 (€7,000 of income for 2022) (see note 22.d).\n\n#### **Pension commitments**\n\nThe Group classifies its commitments according to their nature as either defined contribution, for which the Group is only required to make fixed contributions to a third party, or defined benefit, for which the Group undertakes to pay an amount when the contingency occurs based on variables such as age, years of service and salary.\n\nThe Group's commitments are as follows:\n\n#### *Renta 4, Sociedad de Valores, S.A.*\n\nIn accordance with the collective bargaining agreement in force at Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, in the case of employees from the former stockbrokers' offices, there is an obligation to pay a long-service bonus on reaching 25, 35 or 45 years of service. The Group has not made any provision for this item as it considers that the amount accrued at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is not significant.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4, S.A., Sociedad de Valores, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement in force, must provide coverage for early retirement, death and disability for employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement for Securities Companies and Agencies of the Autonomous Community of Madrid. The Company is covering these commitments by setting up a defined benefit pension plan.\n\nIn addition, for the rest of the employees of this company who are not covered by this agreement, the Group has been covering the contingencies of retirement, incapacity, death, severe dependence or great dependence through a defined contribution plan with an annual contribution of €600 per employee since 2006.\n\n#### *Renta 4 Banco, S.A., Renta 4 Corporate, S.A., Renta 4 Gestora, S.G.I.I.C., S.A. and Renta 4 Pensiones, S.G.F.P., S.A.*\n\nSince 2007, the Group has been covering for the employees of these companies the contingencies of retirement, incapacity for work, death, severe dependency or severe dependency by setting up two defined contribution plans to which it contributes €600 per employee per year.\n\n#### **Defined contribution plans**\n\nThese plans are measured at the present value of the contributions to be made, unless they are payable\n\nearlier than twelve months after the date of the consolidated financial statements when the related employee services were received, in which case the amount is not discounted. The contribution accrued during the year in this connection is recorded under \"Staff costs\" in the consolidated income statement. The amount corresponding to the contributions recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement amounted to €340,000 and €385,000 for the years 2023 and 2022 (Note 22.d).\n\n#### *Defined benefit plan*\n\nThe Group calculates the present value of its defined benefit plan obligations at the date of the consolidated financial statements, after deducting unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of plan assets, as required by current regulations. The figure thus obtained is recorded as a provision for defined benefit pension funds.\n\nThe Group considers plan assets to be those that meet the following characteristics:\n\n- · They are owned by a legally separate third party that is not a related party.\n- · They are available exclusively to pay or finance commitments to employees.\n\n· They cannot be returned to the Group except when commitments to employees have been settled or to satisfy the Group for benefits provided.\n\n· They are not non-transferable instruments issued by the Group.\n\nThe net amount of current service cost, interest cost, the expected return on any plan assets, past service\n\ncost and the effect of any curtailment or settlement of the plan is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the period.\n\nPast service cost is recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated income statement, unless changes to the plan are conditional on the employee remaining with the Group for a specified period of time, in which case the expense is allocated on a straight-line basis over that period.\n\n\"Actuarial gains and losses\" are those arising from differences between previous actuarial assumptions and reality and from changes in the actuarial assumptions used, and are recognised in full in the consolidated income statement for the year in which they arise.\n\nThe Group has not incurred any costs in relation to its defined benefit obligations in 2023 and 2022 (Note 22.d).\n\nThe Renta 4 Group externalised all its pension commitments to its employees, in accordance with Royal Decree 1588/1999 of 15 October, by setting up pension plans and taking out insurance contracts with a company outside the Renta 4 Group.\n\nSpecifically, the defined benefit retirement obligations of Renta 4, S.A. Sociedad de Valores are covered by assets covered by the related insurance policy and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets at the net amount of the obligations assumed, less the related assets. During the financial year 2021, the defined benefit plan was terminated when the only covered person reached the age of 65. It was agreed with the employee to transfer the existing balance to a defined contribution plan. Since then there have been no defined benefit pension commitments.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe indirect method has been used to prepare the consolidated cash flow statement. This begins with profit or loss, adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions and all types of deferred payment items and accruals that are the cause of past or future operating cash receipts and payments, as well as income and expenses associated with cash flows from activities classified as investing or financing activities.\n\n#### **s) Related party transactions**\n\nRelated party transactions are accounted for in accordance with the valuation rules detailed above.\n\nThe prices of related party transactions are adequately supported and the Parent Company's Administrators consider that there are no risks that could give rise to significant tax liabilities.\n\n#### **t) Statement of changes in net equity**\n\nThe statement of changes in equity presented in these consolidated annual accounts shows the total changes in equity during the year. This information is further broken down into two statements: the statement of recognised income and expense and the statement of total changes in equity. The main features of the information contained in both parts of the statement are explained below:\n\n#### *Consolidated statement of recognised income and expenditure*\n\nThis part of the statement of changes in consolidated net equity presents the income and expenses generated by the Group as a result of its activity during the year, distinguishing between those recognised as profit or loss in the profit and loss account for the year and other income and expenses recognised, in accordance with current legislation, directly in equity.\n\nTherefore, this statement presents:\n\n- · The result of the period.\n- · The net amount of income and expenses recognised temporarily as \"accumulated other comprehensive income\" as valued in the net equity.\n- · The net amount of income and expenses recognised definitively in equity.\n- · The tax on profits accrued for the items indicated in the two preceding paragraphs.\n- · Total recognised income and expenses, calculated as the sum of the above letters.\n\nChanges in income and expenses recognised in equity as \"Other comprehensive income\" are broken down as follows:\n\n#### *Severance payments*\n\nTermination benefits are recognised as a provision and as a personnel expense only when the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date or paying termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\n#### **q) Off-balance sheet customer funds**\n\nThe Group records funds entrusted by third parties for investment in investment companies and funds, pension funds, insurance-savings contracts and discretionary portfolio management in memorandum accounts (off-balance sheet) at their fair value (see Note 23).\n\nIn addition, off-balance sheet items (see Note 19) include assets acquired on behalf of third parties, equity instruments, debt instruments, derivatives and other financial instruments held on deposit for which the Group has a liability to its customers at fair value or, if there is no reliable estimate of fair value, at cost. On occasions, and in accordance with the contracts signed with customers and only when market operations so require (international markets), the Group uses global custody accounts (omnibus), in which the Group appears as the holder of the positions, keeping the necessary internal records to know the breakdown by customer.\n\nTo determine the fair value of these positions, the Group uses the quoted values obtained from the various markets or those provided by the global custodians in the case of units in investment funds (net asset value).\n\n#### **r) Consolidated cash flow statement**\n\n- In the consolidated cash flow statement, the following expressions are used in the following senses:\n- · Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid investments with low risk of changes in value.\n- · Operating activities: typical activities of credit institutions, as well as other activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing activities.\n- · Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n- · Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and liabilities, which are not part of operating activities.\n\n· Valuation gains (losses): includes the amount of income, net of expenses incurred during the year, recognised directly in equity. Amounts recognised in the period in this item are retained in this item, even if in the same period they are transferred to the profit and loss account, to the initial value of other assets or liabilities or reclassified to another item.\n\n· Amounts transferred to the profit and loss account: includes the amount of valuation gains or losses previously recognised in equity, albeit in the same period, which are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n· Amount transferred to the initial value of hedged items: includes the amount of valuation gains or losses previously recognised in equity, albeit in the same period, that are recognised in the initial value of assets or liabilities as a result of cash flow hedges.\n\n· Other reclassifications: includes the amount of the transfers made during the year between valuation adjustment items in accordance with the criteria established in current regulations.\n\nAll items in the statement of recognised income and expense are eligible for recognition in the profit and loss account, except the item \"Actuarial gains (losses) on pension plans\". The amounts of these items are presented gross, with the corresponding tax effect shown under \"Income tax\" in the statement.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Consolidated statement of changes in total net equity*\n\nThis part of the statement of changes in equity presents all changes in equity, including those arising from changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors. This statement therefore shows a reconciliation of the carrying amounts at the beginning and at the end of the year of all the items that make up equity, grouping the movements according to their nature into the following items:\n\n· Effect of changes in accounting policies and correction of errors: which includes changes in equity arising from the retrospective restatement of financial statement balances arising from changes in accounting policies or corrections of errors.\n\n· Total comprehensive income for the period: includes, on an aggregate basis, the total of the items recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses indicated above.\n\nOther changes in equity: includes all other items recognised in equity, such as increases or decreases in the endowment fund, distribution of profit or loss, transactions in own equity instruments, payments in equity instruments, transfers between equity items and any other increases or decreases in equity.\n\n#### **u) Financial guarantees**\n\nFinancial guarantees are contracts whereby the Group undertakes to pay specific amounts for a third party in the event of the latter's failure to do so. The main contracts included under this heading, which are included in the \"Pro memoria\" information at the end of the consolidated balance sheet, are financial guarantees.\n\nWhen the Group issues such contracts, they are recognised under \"Financial liabilities at amortised cost - Other financial liabilities\" on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value and simultaneously under \"Other financial assets\" in \"Loans and receivables\" at the present value of the future cash flows to be received using, for both items, a discount rate similar to that of financial assets granted by the Entity to the counterparty with similar maturity and risk. Subsequent to issuance, such contracts are valued by recording the differences against the profit and loss account as finance income or as commission received, depending on whether they are recorded under \"Other financial assets\" or \"Other financial liabilities\", respectively. In addition to the above, financial guarantees will be hedged as set out in Note 5.a.2 relation to credit risk hedging.\n\n#### **v) Leases**\n\nOn 1 January 2019, IFRS 16 became effective, replacing IAS 17 \"Leases\". The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model, which requires the recognition of assets and liabilities for all lease contracts. The standard provides two exceptions to the recognition of lease assets and liabilities, which can be applied in the case of short-term contracts and those where the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nThe Bank has decided to apply both exemptions. The lessee must recognise in assets a right of use representing its right to use the leased asset which is recorded under ''Tangible assets - Property, plant and equipment'' in the balance sheet (see Note 13), and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments which is recorded under ''Financial liabilities at amortised cost - Other financial liabilities'' in the balance sheet (see Note 16).\n\nOn the commencement date of the lease, the lease liability represents the present value of all outstanding lease payments. Liabilities recognised in this balance sheet caption are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost, which is determined using the effective interest method.\n\nRights of use are initially recorded at cost. This cost includes the initial valuation of the lease liability, any payments that are made prior to the commencement date less lease incentives received, all initial direct expenses incurred, as well as an estimate of expenses to be incurred by the lessee such as expenses related to the removal and dismantling\n\nof the underlying asset. Assets recorded under this item in the balance sheets are measured after initial recognition at cost less cost:\n\n· Accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment; and\n\n· Any revaluation of the related lease liability.\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities is recognised in the income statement under \"Interest expense\" (see Note 22.a). Variable payments not included in the initial valuation of the lease liability are recorded under \"Administrative expenses - Other administrative expenses\" (see Note 22.d).\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the acquisition cost of the assets over the life of the lease contract. Depreciation of tangible assets is recorded under \"Depreciation and amortisation\" in the income statement (see Note 13).\n\nIn the event that one of the two exceptions is chosen in order not to recognise the right of use and the related liability in the balance sheet, the related lease payments are recognised in the profit and loss account, over the lease term or on a straight-line basis or in another manner that best represents the structure of the lease transaction, under \"Administrative expenses - Other administrative expenses\" (see Note 22.e).\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nActivity in financial instruments may involve the assumption or transfer of one or more types of risk by the Group. The risks related to financial instruments are:\n\n· Credit risk. The risk that one party to the financial instrument contract will fail to meet its contractual obligations because of the insolvency or incapacity of the natural or legal persons and will cause the other party to incur a financial loss.\n\n· Liquidity risk, sometimes referred to as funding risk, is the risk that arises either from an entity's inability to sell a financial asset quickly for an amount close to its fair value or from an entity's difficulty in finding funds to meet its commitments related to financial instruments.\n\n· Market risk: These are risks arising from holding financial instruments whose value may be affected by changes in market conditions; they include three types of risk:\n\n**(i)** Foreign exchange risk: It arises as a consequence of changes in the exchange rate between currencies.\n\n**(ii)** Interest rate risk: It arises as a consequence of changes in market interest rates.\n\n**(iii)** Price risk: It arises as a result of changes in market prices, either because of factors specific to the instrument itself or because of factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group holds positions in equity instruments which, although they expose it to this type of risk, do not do so to a significant extent.\n\nThe Group has implemented a risk management model based on the following pillars:\n\n#### **a) Credit risk**\n\n#### **a.1 Credit risk management and measurement**\n\nCredit risk arises from the potential loss caused by the failure of the Group's counterparties to meet their contractual obligations. In the case of repayable financing granted to third parties, this occurs as a result of the non-recovery of principal, interest and other items in the terms of the amount, term and other conditions established in the contracts. Offbalance sheet risks arise from the counterparty's failure to meet its obligations to third parties, which requires the Group to assume them as its own by virtue of the commitment it has entered into.\n\nThe Group takes on credit risk exposure when counterparties fail to meet their commitments. In this respect, it distinguishes between two types of counterparties: customers in general and financial institutions and public administrations. The current customer credit risk control system is based on the development of new systems for the evaluation and classification of individual and group debtors, from\n\nwhich provisions are determined to cover possible losses.\n\nAs regards the granting, monitoring and control of risk with customers in general, the Group's Risk Control Department supervises the correct functioning of the current system of discretionary management of operating limits, which are always granted on the basis of the collateral (securities) deposited with the Group. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts signed with customers, the Group may dispose of customers' securities and investment fund shares in order to compensate the customer's debit balances in the event of non-payment (non-replenishment of funds) by the customer.\n\n#### **a.2 Total credit risk exposure**\n\nThe following table shows the total credit risk exposure at year-end 2023 and 2022, using the criteria established for the calculation of the basis of the impairment provision:\n\nThe total risk exposure includes the consolidated balance sheet items detailed in the table above excluding valuation adjustments. At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the maximum level of credit risk exposure, without taking into account collateral and other credit enhancements, does not differ from the carrying amount shown in these financial statements.\n\nLoans and advances - Credit institutions: the main item in this portfolio is financial guarantees with foreign credit institutions.\n\nLoans and advances - Client: these are basically debit balances with private individuals in connection with securities transactions, for which the positions held by these customers with the Group are collateralised. Where the Group classifies these balances as impaired, impairment losses are determined by taking into account the value of these positions that are used as collateral.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022 there are no individual exposures in breach of the limits set by the Bank of Spain. The distribution of the total country credit risk exposure by country as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is shown below.\n\n|                                                                              | 2023      | 2022      | Thousands of Eur |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits                     | 1,093,149 | 771,361   |                  |\n| Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income | 314,066   | 828,427   |                  |\n| Central banks                                                                | -

The credit quality of the customer credit portfolios and other equity instruments is not disclosed as most of the Group's exposure is not externally rated.\n\n#### **a.4 Credit risk for construction and real estate development financing**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no lending operations for the financing of construction and property development activities. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no loans granted for house purchases. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no foreclosed assets from financing to construction and property development companies.\n\n#### **a.5 Loan and credit refinancing and restructuring policy.**\n\nThe Group uses the following definitions:\n\n· Refinancing operation: a transaction which, regardless of the holder or collateral, is granted or used for economic or legal reasons related to the holder's financial difficulties to cancel one or more transactions granted by the institution itself or by other institutions in its group to the holder or to one or more other companies in its economic group, or by which such transactions are brought fully or partially up to date with payments, in order to enable the holders of the cancelled or refinanced transactions to repay their debt (principal and interest) because they are unable, or are expected to be unable, to meet their conditions in due time and form.\n\n· Refinanced operation: an operation that is fully or partially brought current as a result of a refinancing operation carried out by the institution itself or another entity of its economic group.\n\n· Restructured transaction: a transaction in which, for economic or legal reasons related to the holder's financial difficulties, its financial conditions are modified in order to facilitate the payment of the debt (principal and interest) because the holder is unable, or is expected to be unable, to comply with those conditions in due time and form, even if such modification was foreseen in the contract. In any case, operations in which a write-down is made or assets are received to reduce the debt, or in which the terms of the debt are modified to lengthen its maturity, vary the amortisation schedule to reduce the amount of the instalments in the short term or reduce their frequency, are considered to be restructured, or establish or lengthen the grace period for principal, interest or both, except where it can be proven that the terms are modified for reasons other than the financial difficulties of the holders and are similar to those applying in the market at the date of modification to transactions granted to customers with a similar risk profile.\n\n· Rollover transaction: a transaction entered into to replace a transaction previously granted by the institution itself, without the borrower having, or being expected to have in the future, financial difficulties, i.e. the transaction is entered into for reasons other than refinancing.\n\n· Renegotiated transaction: a transaction in which the financial terms of the transaction are changed without the borrower having, or being expected to have in the future, financial difficulties, i.e. where the terms are changed for reasons other than restructuring.\n\nIn any case, in order to classify a transaction as a renewal or renegotiated transaction, the holders must have the capacity to obtain on the market, on the date of renewal or renegotiation, transactions for an amount and with financial conditions similar to those applied by the entity, and these must be adjusted to those granted on that date to customers with a similar risk profile.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 the Group has six refinancing operations (six operations at 31 December 2022), refinanced or restructured for an amount of €6.313 million (€8.105 million at 31 December 2022) covered by securities collateral for an amount of €9.397 million (€8.748 million at 31 December 2022). These operations will mature in 2024.\n\n#### **a.6 Concentration**\n\nThe following is a detail of the concentration of risks as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 by activity and geographical

(Parent Company) aims to maintain a long-term financing structure that is in line with the liquidity of its assets and whose maturity profiles are compatible with the generation of stable and recurring cash flow that allows it to manage its balance sheet without short-term liquidity tensions.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4, Sociedad de Valores, S.A. (subsidiary) must comply with a liquidity ratio whereby it must maintain a volume of investments in highly liquid, low-risk assets for an amount equivalent to 10% of its liabilities with a residual term of less than one year, excluding instrumental and transitory credit accounts (brokerage clients).\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/876 introduced reporting requirements on the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The latest amendments entered into force on 28 June 2021 (Article 17 of Implementing Regulation 2021/451) for the data of the same month.\n\nThe NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to the amount of stable funding required and requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. This ratio shall be at least 100% at all times.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the group was in compliance with the liquidity ratio.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main components of the NSFR ratio and the LCR ratio as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are shown below:\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                                                | Thousands of Euro |                                 |                                  | Financial year 2022                                                                                |           |                                   |                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                    | Amount            | Stable<br>financing<br>required | Stable<br>financing<br>available |                                                                                                    | Importe   | Financiación<br>estable requerida | Financiación<br>estable<br>disponible |\n| STABLE FINANCING REQUIRED                                                                          | 2,092,936         | 561,574                         | -

However, the Group periodically measures the risk of these positions using the VaR (Value at risk) methodology, which expresses the maximum expected loss for a specific time horizon determined on the basis of the historical performance of a security or portfolio. The VaR of these portfolios (at 1 day and for a confidence level of 98.75%) as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n#### **c.1) Foreign exchange risk**\n\nThe Group's exposure to this risk corresponds mainly to its investment in South America, although it is not significant.\n\n#### **c.2) Interest rate risk**\n\nThis is defined as the possibility that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group as a whole. These changes may arise as a result of movements in yield curves or in the credit spreads applied to counterparties.\n\nThe Directors consider the exposure to this risk to be insignificant. In accordance with current regulations, the Renta 4 Group analyses the adverse impact on its economic value and net interest income of a change in interest rates, without in any case exceeding the limits established for the aggregation of own funds to cover this type of risk\n\n#### **d) Other risks**\n\nAs a result of the investments held by the Group in foreign countries, as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 there are no restrictions on its ability to access or utilise the assets and settle the liabilities.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs described in Note 4.f), except for financial instruments classified under \"Financial assets at amortised cost\" and equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the Group's financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.\n\nSimilarly, except for financial liabilities recognised under \"Financial liabilities at amortised cost\", all other financial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDetails of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are presented below by class of financial assets and liabilities and at the following levels:\n\n**LEVEL 1:** Financial instruments whose fair value has been determined by taking their quoted market price in active markets, without making any changes to those assets.\n\n**LEVEL 2:** Financial instruments whose fair value has been estimated on the basis of quoted prices in organised markets for similar instruments or by using other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are based on directly or indirectly observable market data.\n\n**LEVEL 3:** Instruments whose fair value has been estimated using valuation techniques in which some significant input is not based on observable market data.\n\nThe principal valuation methods, assumptions and inputs used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments classified in Levels 1, 2 and 3 (there are no financial instruments classified) by type of financial instrument at 31 December 2022 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n· Derived from negotiation: The fair value of most proprietary trading derivatives has been determined on the basis of quoted prices in organised markets for similar instruments or by using other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are based on directly or indirectly observable market data (Level 2).\n\n· Debt securities: The fair value of debt instruments has been determined on the basis of quoted prices on official markets (Bank of Spain's Central Book-Entry System), BME Clearing panels (credit institutions) or by applying prices obtained from information service providers who construct their prices on the basis of prices reported by contributors. Spanish government debt securities listed on an active market have been considered in Level 1, while private debt securities have been considered in Level 2.\n\n· Equity instruments: For the determination of the fair value of all the Group's investments in quoted equity instruments, quoted prices on official markets have been used and these have therefore been classified in Level 1 of the above tables. Following a prudent approach, in the event that any of the inputs used in the valuation are not observable on the market, the instruments (FCR/ SCR) will be classified at Tier 3. Similarly, costvalued capital instruments are classified at Tier 3.\n\nDuring the financial years 2023 and 2022 there have been no transfers between levels, nor have there been any significant changes in the valuation of unquoted equity instruments included in the portfolio of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe amounts recognised in the profit and loss accounts in 2022 and 2022 for changes in the fair value of the Bank's financial instruments, corresponding to unrealised gains and losses, distinguishing between those financial instruments whose fair value is determined by reference to published market prices in active markets (Level 1), is estimated using a valuation technique whose inputs are obtained from observable market data (Level 2) and the remainder (Level 3), together with the cumulative changes in value at 31 December 2023 and 2022 that have not materialised, are not significant for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Financial liabilities**\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the breakdown of the balance of this heading is as follows:\n\n|                                        |                  |            | Fair Value Hierarchy |         |         |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| 31/12/2023                             | Total<br>Balance | Fair Value | Level 1              | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n| Financial liabilities held for trading | -

The Board of Directors is the highest operational decision-making body of each business. The definition of the business segments takes into account the inherent risks and management particularities of each segment. Likewise, the segregation of activity and results by business is based on the basic business units, for which accounting and management figures are available. The same general principles are applied as those used in the Group's management information, and the measurement, valuation and accounting principles applied are basically the same as those used in the preparation of the financial statements.\n\nThe business lines described below have been established based on the Group's organisational structure in place at year-end 2023 and 2022, taking into account the nature of the services offered and the customer segments at which they are targeted.

(generated on the acquisition of Gesdinco Gestión, S.G.I.I.C.), Renta 4 Pensiones, E.G.F.P., S.A. and Renta 4 Luxembourg, S.A.\n\nUntil 2015, the Group had recorded other goodwill associated with the \"Chile\" CGU; this goodwill was identified with the expected business to be generated by the sale of other services offered by the Renta 4 Group to Chilean customers (brokerage, asset management-investment funds, pension funds and portfolio management), and by the possible expansion of the customer portfolio in Chile due to the possibility of operating in the Spanish market. However, in 2015, based on the results obtained\n\nby this CGU, the directors considered it necessary to recognise impairment losses of €129,000 in this CGU, recognised under \"Impairment or reversal of impairment of non-financial assets - Intangible assets\" in the consolidated income statement for 2015 (Note 22-g). As a result of this impairment, as at 31 December 2015, the goodwill of the Chile CGU was fully impaired.\n\nThe Group has performed an impairment test on the goodwill at 31 December 2023 and 2022 of the \"Trading\" CGU and the \"Management\" CGU, based on the assumptions set out below.\n\nThe impairment test performed by the Parent Company has been verified by an independent expert who, on 15 February 2024, issued a report on the impairment test and the correct valuation of the goodwill at 31 December 2023 and therefore no impairment has been recognised in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAccordingly, and based on the estimates and projections available to the Bank's directors, no impairment losses have been incurred during 2023 that would have required the recording of additional impairment losses.\n\nAccording to the regulations, impairment occurs when the net book value exceeds the recoverable amount,\n\nwhich is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In this case, the recoverable amount of the above CGUs has been determined following an income approach; specifically, the dividend discount methodology has been used based on cash flow projections based on the budgets approved by the Group's management as follows:\n\nThe main assumptions used according to the above methodology are described below:\n\n#### **a.1 Projected period**\n\nAs required by paragraph 33 (b), from IAS 36, the projected period considered for the estimation of future cash flows in both CGUs is 5 years, in accordance with the budgets approved by the Group's management for the next 5 years. We believe that this period is adequate to reflect the current business plan projected for each of them.\n\n#### **a.2 Discount rate**\n\nThe discount rates reflect management's estimate of unit-specific risk. This is the benchmark used by management to assess operational development and future investment proposals. The discount rate applied to calculate the value in use of each of the CGUs at the valuation date was the cost of equity, and was determined in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\n\nThis model uses as a basis the risk-free rate (Rf), which has been calculated by considering the average yield of the last three months of 2023 on the Spanish 10-year government bond for the Intermediation CGU, to which is added the market risk premium (Rm) multiplied by the beta coefficient considered appropriate for the CGU's risk and growth profile.\n\nThe result obtained, as shown in the table above, is 10.96% and 10.61% for Intermediation CGU's and Management respectively (2022: 11.05% for the Intermediation CGU and 10.64% for the Management).\n\n## **a.3 Perpetual growth rate**\n\nFor the calculation of the perpetual growth rate, the estimate of long-term inflation from public sources has been used, as well as the potential growth of the asset management and brokerage industry on such inflation. The growth rate used was 2.68% and 2.55% in the Cash Generating Unit of Intermediation and Management respectively (2022: 2.66% and 2.52% in the Cash Generating Unit of Intermediation and Management respectively).\n\nThe Management of these CGUs considers that this growth rate is justified.\n\n**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**\n\nIn order to ensure the soundness of its calculation, management has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the value in use of the different CGUs analysed with respect to changes in the main assumptions affecting this calculation. For this purpose, sensitivity analyses have been carried out for the discount rate, the perpetual growth rate and the required capital requirements. The main results are shown below:\n\n|                         |        |                                     | Thousands of Eur |\n|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                         | Cost   | Value corrections due to impairment | Total            |\n| Balances as at 31.12.21 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n| Movements               | -      | -                                   | -                |\n| Balances as at 31.12.22 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n| Movements               | -      | -                                   | -                |\n| Balances as at 31.12.23 | 17,772 | (2,481)                             | 15,291           |\n\n|                                  |         |         | Thousands of Eur |  |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|--|\n| Intermediation CGU               | 2023    | 2022    |                  |  |\n| Projected period                 | 5 years | 5 years |                  |  |\n| Discount rate (projected period) | 10.96%  | 11.05%  |                  |  |\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.68%   | 2.66%   |                  |  |\n| CGU Management                   | 2024    | 2022    |                  |  |\n| Projected period                 | 5 years | 5 years |                  |  |\n| Discount rate (projected period) | 10.61%  | 10.64%  |                  |  |\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.55%   | 2.52%   |                  |  |\n\n# <span id=\"page-50-0\"></span>Intangible Assets\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **a.4 Intermediation and Management CGUs**\n\nReasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the discount rate used combined with reasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the growth rate in perpetuity compared to the baseline scenario would not result in impairment of the either of the CGUs.\n\nSimilarly, reasonable changes of +/-100 basis points in the discount rate used combined with reasonable changes of +/-0.25 times in the minimum capital requirement for the CGU compared to the baseline scenario would not cause deterioration in either of the CGUs.\n\nAlso, reasonable variations of +/-100 basis points in the perpetual growth rate used combined with reasonable variations of +/-0.25 times in the minimum capital requirement for the CGU compared to the baseline scenario would not cause deterioration in either of the CGUs.\n\n#### **b) Other intangible assets**\n\nThis section of the consolidated balance sheets includes the software acquired from third parties, the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Gesdinco S.A., S.G.I.I.C. and Padinco Patrimonios, S.G.C., S.A., the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores Bolsa, S.A. and the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of BNP Paribas, S.A.'s branch of activity, the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of Renta 4 Chile Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. and the customer portfolio generated in the acquisition of the branch of activity of BNP Paribas, Sucursal en España, S.A . which have had the following movements in financial years 2023 and 2022:\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 \"Other intangible assets\" includes the fully amortised customer portfolio of Gesdinco and Padinco (€815,000 cost and €815,000 accumulated amortisation).

The triangle occupies a significant portion of the lower left area of the image, with one of its sides forming a diagonal line that extends upwards and to the right. The background has a subtle, grainy texture that gives it a slightly aged or weathered appearance. The contrast between the smooth, deep red of the triangle and the textured, lighter background creates a visually striking composition.\n\nThe following is the accounting statement prepared by the Parent Company's Directors based on its individual results, which showed the existence of sufficient liquidity for the distribution of an interim dividend out of the profits for the financial year 2022 for a gross amount of €10.155 million:\n\nThe Parent Company has sufficient liquidity at that date to pay the dividend.\n\n#### **h) Earnings per share**\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the average number of ordinary shares that will be issued if the shares are potentially converted.\n\n#### Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented below:\n\n#### **i) Minimum own resources**\n\nOn 26 June 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter \"CRR\"), and Directive 2013/36/EU on the taking up of the business of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter \"CRD\"), which entered into force on 1 January 2014, with progressive implementation until 1 January 2019 and which entails the repeal of the solvency regulations in force to date.\n\nThe CRR and the CRD have been developed in the delegated aspects indicated in the same regulation mainly through Regulations (EU), Delegated Regulations (EU) of the European Commission and EBA Guidelines, with particular relevance of Regulation (EU) 876/2019 which amends Regulation EU 575/2013 by incorporating amendments to the leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, own funds and eligible liabilities requirements, counterparty risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, and reporting and disclosure requirements.\n\nThe CRR and the CRD regulate capital requirements in the European Union and reflect the recommendations set out in the Basel III Capital Accord, in particular:\n\n· The CRR, which is directly applicable by Member States, contains the prudential requirements to be implemented by credit institutions and, among other aspects, covers:\n\n· The definition of eligible own funds items, establishing the requirements to be met by hybrid instruments for their calculation and limiting the calculation of accounting minority interests.\n\n· The definition of prudential filters and deductions from capital elements in each of the capital tiers. In this respect, it should be noted that the Regulation incorporates new deductions with respect to Basel II (tax assets dependent on future net profits, pension funds, etc.) and modifies existing deductions. However, a phased timetable for full implementation is established.\n\n· The minimum requirements are set out in Art. 92 CRR, establishing three levels of own funds: ordinary Tier 1 capital with a minimum ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital with a minimum ratio of 6% and total capital with a minimum required ratio of 8%. However, the competent authority has the power to require additional own funds requirements.\n\n· The requirement for financial institutions to calculate a leverage ratio, which is defined as the Bank's Tier I capital divided by total assumed exposure not adjusted for risk.\n\nThe main object and purpose of the CRD, which is to be implemented by Member States in their national legislation at their discretion, is to coordinate national provisions concerning access to the business of credit institutions and investment firms, their governance arrangements and their supervisory framework.\n\nThe CRD, among other aspects, includes additional capital requirements over and above those established in the CRR, the non-compliance with which implies limitations on discretionary distributions of earnings, specifically:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    | 2023       | 2022       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company (thousands of euro)                                                                  | 26,127     | 21,540     |\n| Financial costs of the convertible bond issue (thousands of euro)                                                                                  | -          | -          |\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company, eliminating financial<br>expenses of the convertible bond issue (thousands of euro) | 26,127     | 21,540     |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding treasury shares for the<br>calculation of basic earnings                                      | 40,681,105 | 40,620,613 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding treasury shares for the<br>calculation of diluted earnings per share                          | 40,681,105 | 40,620,613 |\n| Basic earnings per share (euro)                                                                                                                    | 0.64       | 0.53       |\n| Diluted earnings per share (euro)                                                                                                                  | 0.64       | 0.53       |\n\nThousands of Euro\n\n| Results net of tax as at 31 October 2022                                              | 16,639 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Interim dividend distribution for the year 2022                                       | -      |\n| Limit to be distributed (*)                                                           | 16,639 |\n| Cash flow forecast for the period from the date of the agreement and one year forward |        |\n| Cash balances at the date of the agreement                                            | 130,87 |\n| Projected cash balances one year from the date of the agreement                       | 143.96 |\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n· A capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer, following on from the Basel III regulatory framework and in order to mitigate the procyclical effects of financial regulation, includes a requirement to hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of common equity Tier I capital for all financial institutions and an institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer of common equity Tier I capital.\n\n· A systemic risk buffer, with the aim of mitigating systemic risks, i.e. to cover risks of disturbances in the financial system that could have serious negative consequences for the financial system and the real economy of a Member State.\n\n· A buffer for global systemically important institutions and other systemically important institutions, with the objective of covering the potential impact of the failure of institutions that, due to their size, complexity, interconnectedness, cross-border activity and/or difficulty of substitution, may have on the financial system and the real economy.\n\nIn this regard, in application of article 68.2.a) of Law 10/2014, the Bank of Spain required a total capital ratio of no less than 12.13% at the consolidated and individual level during the financial year 2023. A requirement has been received from the Bank of Spain which establishes a total minimum capital ratio at consolidated and individual level of 12.13% for the year 2024.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Renta 4 Group complies with the aforementioned ratio of 18.62%. As at 31 December 2022 the balance amounted to 14.48%.\n\nWith regard to Spanish legislation, the new legislation is mainly aimed at transposing European legislation to the local level:\n\n· Royal Decree-Law 14/2013 of 29 November on urgent measures for the adaptation of Spanish law to European Union regulations on the supervision and solvency of financial institutions: this partially\n\ntransposes the CRD into Spanish law and enables the Bank of Spain to make use of the options attributed to the competent authorities in the CRR.\n\n· The Bank of Spain Circular 2/2014 of 31 January 2014 to credit institutions on the exercise of various regulatory options contained in Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013. The purpose is to establish, in accordance with the powers conferred, which of the options of the CRR attributed to national competent authorities will have to be complied with from 1 January 2014 by consolidable groups of credit institutions and by credit institutions that are or are not part of a consolidable group, and to what extent. To this end, in this circular, the Bank of Spain makes use of some of the temporary or permanent regulatory options envisaged in the CRR, generally with the aim of allowing continuity in the treatment that Spanish regulations had been giving to certain matters prior to the entry into force of this Community regulation, the justification for which, in some cases, comes from the business model that Spanish institutions have traditionally followed.\n\nThis does not exclude the future exercise of other options provided for competent authorities in the CRR, in many cases, mainly in the case of options of a non-general nature, by direct application of the CRR, without the need for a Bank of Spain circular.\n\n· Law 10/2014 of 26 June 2014 on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, the main purpose of which is to continue with the process of transposition of CRD IV initiated by the Royal Decree-Law 14/2013, of 29 November and to recast certain national provisions in force to date in relation to the regulation and discipline of credit institutions. The main new features include, for the first time, the express obligation of the Bank of Spain to present, at least once a year, a Supervisory Programme setting out the content and form that supervisory activity will take, and the actions to be taken on the basis of the results obtained. This programme shall include the performance of a stress test at least once a year.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2014 of 30 July 2014 to credit institutions and approved appraisal companies and services. This Circular, among other measures, amends Circular 2/2014 of 31 January on the exercise of various regulatory options contained in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment services, with the aim of unifying the treatment of the deduction of intangible assets during the transitional period established by the aforementioned Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, bringing the treatment of goodwill into line with that of other intangible assets.\n\n· Royal Decree 84/2015 of 13 February 2015 implementing Law 10/2014 of 26 June on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, a text which develops aspects of the regulations it implements, with particular emphasis on the activity requirements for credit institutions, the elements of the supervisory function and the regulatory development of capital buffers.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 2/2016 of 2 February 2016 to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017 of 27 November to credit institutions on public and confidential financial reporting standards and model financial statements, which completes the adaptation to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 2/2018 of 21 December amending Circular 4/2017 of 27 November to credit institutions on public and confidential financial reporting standards and financial statement formats, and Circular 1/2013 of 24 May on the Central Credit Register, and model financial statements, which completes the adaptation to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 5/2021 of 22 December amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. (BOE of 23 December 2021).\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2022 of 30 March amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n· Bank of Spain Circular 3/2022 of 2023 March amending Circular 2/2016 of 2 February to credit institutions on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of the Spanish legal system to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the Circular 1/2022 of 24 January, to financial credit institutions, about liquidity, prudential regulations and reporting obligations (BOE of 14 November 2023).\n\nIn relation to the Group's eligible own funds, the prudential filter concerning additional valuation adjustments on assets measured at fair value pursuant to articles 34 and 105 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its implementing regulation Implementing Regulation (EU) 101/2016 is applied using the simplified approach.\n\nIn relation to minimum capital requirements, the Bank applies:\n\n· The standardised approach is applied to credit risk requirements.\n\n· The original risk method is used to calculate counterparty risk exposures.\n\n· For the calculation of capital requirements due to market risk, the standardised approach has been used.\n\n· The basic indicator method was used to calculate the capital requirements linked to operational risk. \n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nSet out below is a breakdown of the Group's eligible own funds at 31 December 2023 and 2022, indicating each of their components and deductions, and broken down, as required by the new regulations, into Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital:\n\n# **j) Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss - Changes in fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nThis item in the consolidated balance sheet includes the net amount of changes in the fair value of debt instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income that should be classified as part of the Group's equity.

Of the total number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests submitted to the Customer Care Service, 2 were not admitted for processing and a corresponding case was not opened, because they did not meet the necessary requirements to be processed. The rest of the claims, complaints, incidents and/ or queries or requests were admitted to processing, opening the corresponding file and after its analysis finally dictating the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nIn relation to complaints and/or queries submitted to the Ombudsman during 2023, a total of 9 complaint files were received, of which the Ombudsman issued six (6) unfavourable resolutions for customers, two (2) favourable resolutions for customers, and one (1) case which is still pending resolution.\n\nOf the 57 cases admitted by the Customer Care Service, sixteen (16) were complaints, thirty (30) were claims, one (1) incident and ten (10) queries or requests for information, which were duly answered after requesting various information from the corresponding departments.\n\nThirty (30) claims received were admitted for processing in 2023, nine fewer than the thirty-nine (39) in 2022.\n\nAs for the type of resolutions of the complaints issued by Renta 4's Customer Care Service during 2023, there were eleven (11) unfavourable resolutions for the Customer, 37% of the total, a lower figure to that of 2022 (19) and 2021 (23).

Of the total number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests submitted, 2 were not admitted for processing and a corresponding case was not opened, because they did not meet the necessary requirements to be processed.\n\nIn all the complaints admitted for processing, both the Participant Ombudsman and Renta 4's Customer Care Service studied and analysed in detail each of the complaints and issues raised, reviewing the procedures established by Renta 4 and finally issuing the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nIn relation to complaints and/or queries submitted to the Ombudsman during 2023, a total of 9 complaint files were received, of which the Ombudsman issued six (6) unfavourable resolutions for customers, two (2) favourable resolutions for customers, and one (1) case which is still pending resolution. In this regard, it should be noted that most of the complaints were resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOn the other hand, during 2023, the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/ or requests submitted to the Renta 4 Customer Care Service totalled 57, of which two (2) were not admitted for processing because they were not considered customers of the Entity. Of the 57 cases admitted, sixteen (16) were complaints, thirty (30) were claims, one (1) incident and ten (10) queries or requests for information, which were duly answered after requesting various information from the corresponding departments.\n\nWith regard to the evolution of complaints, it should be noted that in 2023 the number of complaints received was thirty (30), nine fewer than the 39 in 2022 and a similar number to the average number of twenty-seven (27) complaints received during the 19 years that Renta 4's Customer Care Service has been in operation. This figure does not represent a significant number, being in line with previous years, as can be seen in **Graph 1.**\n\n## **Graph 1.- Total Complaints 2004-2023**\n\nImage /page/83/Figure/12 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Graph 1.- Total Complaints 2004-2023\". The y-axis is labeled \"No. of complaints\" and ranges from 0 to 45. The x-axis represents the years from 2004 to 2023. The bar heights correspond to the number of complaints for each year. The number of complaints for each year are as follows: 2004: 21, 2005: 18, 2006: 13, 2007: 10, 2008: 25, 2009: 23, 2010: 21, 2011: 14, 2012: 24, 2013: 33, 2014: 22, 2015: 35, 2016: 27, 2017: 30, 2018: 35, 2019: 25, 2020: 44, 2021: 38, 2022: 39, 2023: 30.\n\n**Renta 4 Banco, S.A.** Customer Service Report **Financial year 2023** \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's more, the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests received by the Customer Care Service and Participant Ombudsman during the 2023 financial year, a total of 66, is not very significant figure in relation to the total number of clients with assets that Renta 4 held at 31st December 2023, a total of 124,908 customers, as has been the case in all previous years, such as in 2022, when a total of 65 claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests were admitted for processing, compared to 118,239 customers at the end of 2022. In the same way, if we compare the number of complaints submitted during 2023, with regards to the equity managed by Renta 4 at the end of 2023, €30,306,348,491 or the number of commercial offices that Renta 4 has throughout Spain, 64 offices.\n\nIn summary, the number of complaints received by Renta 4's Customer Care Service and Ombudsman during 2023 financial year continues to be insignificant and irrelevant when compared to the number of clients or the assets managed by Renta 4.\n\n#### **Complaints classified by Resolution Type**\n\nIn relation to the type of resolution issued by the Customer Care Service during 2023, as shown in **Table 1,** all of the 30 complaints received have been admitted for processing. Of which, eleven (11) unfavourable resolutions to the customer have been issued, 37% of the admitted complaints, these figures being lower than for the 2022 (19) and 2021 (23) financial years.\n\nOn the other hand, six (6) complaints were resolved in favour of the customer, 20% of the total, three more than in 2022. Furthermore, in eight (8) complaints the Customer Care Service has urged the parties to reach an agreement, 27% of the total, a lower total than the thirteen (13) agreements reached in 2022, which accounted for 34% of the total. On the other hand, in three (3) of the cases the customers withdrew the complaint, following explanations and clarifications provided by the Service. Finally, it should be noted that, at 31 December 2023, two (2) claims were in the processing and study phase, of which, as of the date hereof one (1) has been resolved unfavourably and one (1) has been resolved favourably for the customer.\n\nIn cases in which Renta 4 and the customers reached an agreement in 2023, the amount paid amounted to €1,777.36, while the amount corresponding to the favourable resolutions issued was €567.01. In addition, two duly signed settlement proposals have yet to be received from customers as a result of two resolutions favourable to customers by the supervisory bodies, which would entail a disbursement of €4,037.50 for the Entity. In total, the amount disbursed up to the current date by the entity for claims submitted in 2023 has amounted to €2,344.37, which is a higher figure than the €1,086.96 disbursed in the 2022 financial year, but insignificant when compared to the entity's financial figures and much less than the amounts paid in previous years; in 2021 it amounted to €6,235.89, in 2020 it amounted to €343,806.43, in 2019 it amounted to €8,454.71, and in 2018 €24,832.61.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that Renta 4's Customer Care Service, in addition to carrying out the main function of resolving claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests, plays an intermediary role between the Customer and the Entity. After analysing the reason for the claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/or requests and reviewing the procedures, in those cases where it is feasible, it is the Service that invites the parties to reach an agreement.\n\n#### **Complaints classified by content**\n\nIn relation to the content of the complaints reflected in **Table 2,** and following the same classification used in previous years' reports, the figures are as follows:\n\n#### **TABLE 1 Evolution of Complaints submitted to the CCS -

Classification by Content**\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, the heading with the highest number of complaints was Commissions and Tariffs, with twelve (12) complaints, 40% of the total, eight (8) complaints in the section on Investment Funds-Pension Plans and another seven (7) in the section on Others, 27% and 23% respectively of the total for each section, and three (3) complaints in the section on Securities Transactions and Order Execution, 10% of the total.\n\nThe Securities Transactions and Order Execution section includes complaints relating to discrepancies in trading and order execution, and the procedure for marketing and advising customers on the various financial products. A total of three (3) complaints were received in the year 2023, 10% of the total, the same figure as in 2022.\n\nThe complaints included in Investment Funds-Pension Plans are those where the content refers to the commercialisation and operation of the subscription, refund and transfer of investments funds and pension plans. A total of eight (8) complaints were received in 2023, 27% of the total, two less than in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, the section on Fees and Commissions includes complaints relating to the fees and expenses associated with the different investment products and services. In 2023, the number of complaints on this matter totalled twelve (12), 40% of the total, which is lower than in the previous year, but which represents the same percentage as in 2022 and equal to the higher level when fewer complaints were received under the heading of Commissions, such as in 2021 with eight (8) (21%), in 2020 with three (3) complaints (7%) and six (6) (24%) in 2019.\n\nFinally, the complaints classified under Other include all those complaints that could not be included in any of the other chapters, the content of these complaints being therefore very heterogeneous. In 2023 there were a total of seven (7) complaints, 23% of the total, slightly less than in 2022 (10) and 2021 (11), but representing a similar percentage, 26% and 29% respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, in recent years the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain have been requesting a greater amount and variety of information from the Customer Care Services of the institutions regarding complaints and with a greater degree of detail, establishing different classifications on the reasons, causes and types of products, among others. This information enables regulators to prepare annual reports with aggregated information for all institutions.\n\nFor this reason, as in previous years, this Annual Report includes information on the complaints filed from 2016 to 2023, using the classification and reporting criteria required by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain (BdE),as shown in **Tables 3 and 4** of this report.\n\n#### **TABLE 4 Evolution of Complaints submitted to the CCS -

In this regard, a ranking of 15 institutions was provided, as 30 of them had fewer than 8 complaints and were grouped in the same category identified as \"other institutions\". Renta 4 Banco occupied an intermediate position in this ranking.\n\n# **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn summary, the Renta 4 Customer Care Service considers that the number of claims, complaints, incidents, queries and/ or requests received during 2023, a total of 57 from the Renta 4 Customer Service Department and 9 received by the Ombudsman, having remained stable with respect to 2022, and continues being an insignificant figure, both in absolute and relative terms, when compared with the total number of the Entity's customers, with the assets managed by Renta 4 or with respect to the amounts claimed in the same. On the other hand, the evolution of the number of complaints since the start of its activity in 2004 and up to 2023 continues to be of little relevance and remains stable with respect to the growth of the Entity and its business magnitudes.\n\n**Files received by the Complaints Service of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) or the Bank of Spain (BdE).**\n\nOf the 55 files received and processed by the Customer Care Service in 2023, twelve (12) were submitted by customers to the CNMV or BdE Complaints Services, ten (10) to the CNMV and two (2) to the BdE.\n\nIn summary, the number of files processed before the Supervisory Bodies during the financial year 2023 is not a significant and relevant figure in relation to the total number of files, with practically all the files being resolved by the Customer Care Service without the need for intervention by the Supervisory Bodies.\n\nIn relation to the resolutions issued by the Supervisory Bodies, on six (6) occasions the resolution has been unfavourable to the customer, on four (4) occasions the Body has resolved in favour of the customer, and at the present date there are two (2) cases pending resolution by the CNMV or BdE.\n\nA breakdown of this data is given in **Table 5.**\n\n**TABLE 5a Complaints to the BdE - Classification by Resolution type**\n\n| 2023                                        |    |      |\n|---------------------------------------------|----|------|\n| Clasificación por<br>Tipo de Resolución BdE | Nº | %    |\n| Desfavorable para el cliente                | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Favorable para el cliente                   | 1  | 50 % |\n| Desestimiento Cliente                       | 0  | 0 %  |\n| No admitido a tramite/suspension            | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Pendientes de Resolucion                    | 1  | 50 % |\n| TOTAL                                       | 2  | 100% |\n|                                             |    |      |\n| Clasificación por<br>Tipo de Resolución BdE | Nº | %    |\n| Desfavorable para el cliente                | 6  | 60 % |\n| Favorable para el cliente                   | 3  | 30 % |\n| Desestimiento Cliente                       | 0  | 0 %  |\n| No admitido a tramite/suspension            | 0  | 0 %  |\n| Pendientes de Resolucion                    | 1  | 10 % |\n| TOTAL                                       | 10 | 100% |\n\n**TABLE 5.b Complaints filed with the CNMV - Classification by Resolution type**\n\n**2023**\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 27 June 2014, Law 10/2014 of 26 June 2014 on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions was published in the Official State Gazette, transposing article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 relating to the taking up of the business of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC (CRD IV) and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC.\n\nIn compliance with the provisions of article 87.1 and the Twelfth Transitional Provision of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, credit institutions shall be obliged to publish, specifying by country where they are established, the following information on a consolidated basis for the last financial year for which the accounts have been closed:\n\na) Name, nature and geographical location of the activity.\n\n- b) Turnover and number of full-time employees.\n- c) Gross profit before tax and tax on profit or loss\n- d) Subsidies and public aid received\n\nBy virtue of the above, the information requested is detailed below:\n\n#### **a) Name, nature and geographical location of the activity.**\n\nRenta 4 Banco, S.A. is the entity resulting from the merger by absorption on 30 March 2011 of Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión S.A., (absorbing entity) and Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (absorbed entity), previously called Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A., the change of name of the latter having been registered in the Trade Registry on 8 June 2011. In addition, in the merger process, amendments were made to the bylaws of the absorbing company, changing its name from Renta 4 Servicios de Inversión, S.A. to Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and extending its corporate purpose to include banking activities, as well as investment and ancillary services typical of investment services companies. The Parent Company is registered in the Trade Registry and in the Special Register of Credit Institutions of the Bank of Spain under code 0083.\n\nThe corporate purpose of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. consists of the activities of credit institutions in general, including the provision of investment services, as well as the acquisition, holding, enjoyment, administration and disposal of all kinds of transferable securities, and in particular those determined in article 175 of the Code of Commerce and other legislation in force relating to the activity of such institutions.\n\nThe activity or activities that constitute the corporate purpose may also be carried on by the Parent Company, wholly or partially, indirectly, through the ownership of shares or equity interests in companies with an identical or similar purpose. In addition to the operations it carries out directly, the Bank is the head of a group of subsidiaries, which are engaged in various activities and which, together with the Bank, make up the Renta 4 Group. As a result, the Parent Company is obliged to prepare, in addition to its own individual financial statements, consolidated financial statements for the Group. The Parent Company has its registered office in Madrid, Paseo de la Habana 74.\n\nThe Group is mainly active in Spain. The activities, name, nature and geographical location of the subsidiaries are set out in Annex I to these notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**b) Turnover and number of full-time employees.** \n\nThis section shows information on turnover and the number of full-time employees by country at year-end 2023 and 2022, on a consolidated basis.\n\nTurnover has been taken to be the amount of commissions received, as shown in the Group's consolidated profit and loss account, at the end of the financial years 2023 and 2022:\n\n|            | Thousands of Euro | Number of employees |             |            |\n|------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|\n|            | Turnover          |                     | (full time) |            |\n|            | 31/12/2023        | 31/12/2022          | 31/12/2023  | 31/12/2022 |\n| Spain      | 158,674           | 162,174             | 581         | 553        |\n| Chile      | 3,204             | 4,403               | 35          | 33         |\n| Colombia   | 2,669             | 2,641               | 25          | 23         |\n| Peru       | 594               | 621                 | 25          | 21         |\n| Luxembourg | 937               | 845                 | 4           | 3          |\n| TOTAL      | 166,078           | 170,684             | 670         | 633        |\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n**Renta 4 Banco, S.A.** Annual Banking Report **Financial year 2023**\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **c) Gross profit before tax and tax on profit or loss**\n\nThis heading shows the information corresponding to the consolidated profit before tax and consolidated income tax as reported in the Group's consolidated income statement at year-end 2023 and 2022:\n\n|            | (thousands of Euro) |            |            |            |\n|------------|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|            | Profit before tax   |            | Income tax |            |\n|            | 31/12/2023          | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Spain      | 31,331              | 26,223     | (9,551)    | (7,153)    |\n| Chile      | 3,171               | 2,309      | (378)      | (426)      |\n| Colombia   | 1,188               | 786        | 238        | -          |\n| Peru       | 794                 | 280        | (111)      | (39)       |\n| Luxembourg | (119)               | (216)      | -          | 18         |\n| TOTAL      | 36,365              | 29,382     | (9,802)    | (7,600)    |\n\n#### **d) Public subsidies or grants received**\n\nNo public subsidies or grants have been received during the financial years 2023 and 2022.\n\n#### **e) Return on assets**\n\nThe return on assets calculated as net income divided by the total balance sheet is 1.21% (2022: 0.92%).\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Consolidated [Management Report](#page-93-0) 2023\n\n[03.5](#page-95-0)\n\n**Risk management policy**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.6](#page-95-0)\n\n**Acquisition of treasury shares**\n\n**96**\n\n<span id=\"page-89-0\"></span>[03.7](#page-95-0)\n\n**Environmental impact**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.8](#page-95-0)\n\n**Research and development**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.9](#page-95-0)\n\n**Average supplier payment period**\n\n**96**\n\n[03.10](#page-95-0)\n\n**Events occurring after the end of the financial year**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.11](#page-95-0)\n\n96\n\n**Human resources information**\n\n**<sup>96</sup>** [03.12](#page-95-0)\n\n**Statement of Non-Financial Information** \n\n**96**\n\n# [03.1](#page-90-0) **Economic environment and financial markets**\n\n**91**\n\n[03.3](#page-92-0)\n\n**Evolution of the entity**\n\n[03.2](#page-91-0)\n\n**94** [03.4](#page-94-0) **Evolution of the sector**\n\n**92**\n\n**Foreseeable developments in the company**\n\n**95**\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe financial year 2023 closed with significant increases in global equities (MSCI World +21.8% in USD), recovering losses in 2022, and with more moderate revaluations in fixed income (which have not recovered from the previous years' fall in valuations). 2023 has been the confirmation of a multipolar world, with more standardised interest rates, structural inflationary factors, de-globalization trends and increasing geopolitical risks.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been a surprising year full of unexpected events. At the beginning of December 2022, the market deducted rate hikes of 70 basis points by the Fed (they had been 150), and 140 by the ECB (they had been 250). The financial year began by discounting an economic recession, with the inevitable slowdown in consumption. Profits and margins were going to be affected and leverage was going to be a problem in a world with a higher capital costs. The debate on inflation was very present: How high and for how long? Gross exposure to risk had been reduced, liquidity/cash levels were very high at the beginning of the year, and macroeconomic and profit estimates were significantly reduced. What happened was a very early positive surprise in the form of a gas/energy crisis or escalation in Russia/Ukraine, which was then driven by strong business profits, and led to a stock market upturn earlier in the year.\n\nSubsequently, at several times, several \"shocks\" have been faced: Bankruptcies of regional banks in the United States and Credit Suisse in Europe, conflict in the Middle East, etc. And we have had a bullish end of the year, supported by the fall in yields, picking up the hypothesis of monetary policy easing by the central banks, a scenario reinforced by the good evolution of inflation data.\n\nIntervention rates would have reached their peak after a 525 basis point rise in the United States and 450 in the Eurozone, a rise that has been particularly rapid and intense. At the same time, far from the recession fears that dominated the market a year ago, a scenario of smooth landing of the economy (or no landing at all, if the recession phase does not come to an end) is discounted. At the last meeting of the Fed, its president Jerome Powel declared that inflation will continue to fall, and that he does not contemplate recessive economic scenarios for 2024.\n\nIn essence, it has been a year perhaps more driven by macroeconomics (rates/inflation) and positioning, than by fundamentals. Issues such as quality, leverage, and profitability have been more or less important, at different times of the year, as duration/multiples, and the to risk\n\nor not to risk dynamics have leaned in one direction or another. It has also been a year of great themes, with Artificial Intelligence at the forefront, followed closely by GLP-1, but energy dependence, weak balance sheets, refinancing risks, or China have also been at the forefront.\n\nFrom a geographical and sectoral point of view, American technology has been particularly prominent. The so-called \"Magnificent 7\" (Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla, which already account for c.30% of S&P 500) have risen by 70% on average this year. In addition to the size, quality and profitability of these companies, the market discounts that some of them will benefit greatly from the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the coming years. Nasdaq Composite rose 43.4% in 2023, S&P up 24.2% and Dow Jones up 13.7% (in US dollars).\n\nWithout the spectacular behaviour of the \"Magnificent 7\", the return of the S&P 500 would have been reduced to mid-single digits. In addition to technology, the discretionary consumer sector has been positively highlighted in the United States, supported by a better consumer behaviour compared to the one discounted a year ago. On the negative side, energy, basic consumption and health.\n\nIn Europe, the Eurostoxx 50 ended 2023 with a rise of 19.2%, and the Stoxx 600 with a +12.7%. 28% of the Italian MIB 30, 22.8% of the Ibex 35, or 20.3% of the German DAX, stand out positively. The British and Swiss shares showed a worse relative performance (FTSE 100 and SMI +3.8%). By sector, the best performance has been observed in technology, banks, cars and industrials. The worst, in food and drink, health, basic resources and energy.\n\nOther exchanges such as the Japanese (Nikkei +28%) or Latin America (Brazilian Ibovespa +22%, Mexico and Chile +18%) have performed well. For its part, the Chinese stock market ends the year with falls of 14%, against the strong increases in Western markets. The weaker-than-expected recovery after a pandemic, along with regulatory swings, with an impact on different sectors, creates uncertainty and a lack of confidence in international investors. The process of tightening the regulation on the country's technology industry, begun 3 years ago, has moved to other sectors such as education and video games. The risk premium has therefore been adjusted upwards, causing a fall in the multiples traded by Chinese stocks (discounted against comparables in the United States or Europe).\n\nWith regard to fixed income, in 2023 we saw a sharp rebound in the short tranches of public debt rates, as central banks tightened their monetary policies, causing a reversal of these curves (rates higher in the short term rather than the longer term). At the same time, the resistance of inflation and economic growth were shifting the expectations of rates, toward higher rates, with more increases in 2023, for longer, with less projected decreases in 2024, the so-called \"higher for longer\" rate, which pushed upwards the sections of the curve until the end of the third quarter.\n\nHowever, in the fourth quarter of the year, and with central banks already at what seems to be the peak of the rate hike cycle, there was a sharp correction in rate expectations for 2024, year in which around a fall of 150 basis points (b.p.) of is projected, thanks to the moderation of inflationary pressures. This pushed rates back down, closing all sections of the German government debt curve from 2 years below where they were at the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, following the central bank's hikes, German debt's 6-month rate rose in 2023 by 1.5 percentage points (p.p.) to 3.6% and the 1-year rate 0.7 p.p. to 3.1%. On the contrary, with the prospects of falls for 2024, the 10-year rate ended the year falling 0.6 p.p. to 1.9%.\n\nFurthermore, risk premiums on Spanish and Italian debt remained very contained for much of the year, heavily supported by retail demand in their respective countries, offering interest rates not seen for a long time.\n\nAs far as private fixed income is concerned, credit spreads (credit risk premium versus public debt) expanded significantly in March with a sharp upturn following tensions in the banking sector, which was subsequently corrected, thanks to the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to give stability to this sector, the situation was stabilized. Subsequently, after a temporary rebound in October, credit spreads continued to yield, with special intensity at year-end, as investors bet on a smooth landing of the economy, with significant rate drops in 2024 but without a significant deterioration in business results.\n\nCommodities and precious metals have been mixed in 2023. Brent finished the year at \\$77.3/ barrel, down 10% from a year earlier. On the positive side, gold stands out (+13.5%, up to 2,072 USD/oz, acting as an asset refuge in the current geopolitical context) and copper (+2%), and in negative nickel (-45%) or wheat (-21%).\n\nRegarding currencies, the Euro gained slightly against the dollar, 3% (at 1.11 EUR/USD), having moved in the year in a range of 1.04 – 1.12 EUR/ USD. Latin American currencies have gained against the Euro, by 8% in the case of the Brazilian real and 11% in the case of the Mexican peso.\n\n# <span id=\"page-90-0\"></span>Economic environment and financial markets\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe last two years have marked the end of an era of monetary policy. We are in a new normality, where we have neither zero rates nor a liquidity free bar. With lower growth, higher inflation, higher interest rates and higher debt levels, economic agents and markets are adjusting to the new regime. Central banks face a more complex situation in their fight against inflation, and cannot respond to a weak growth context as they did before, leading to a further dispersion of scenarios. In fact, it is difficult to remember another time where the macroeconomic outlook is so uncertain and dispersed. Recession, soft landing or expansion, inflation or deflation, higher interest rates for longer, or lower and returning to neutral levels. There are arguments that can be considered valid for any scenario. Our central scenario for 2024 is still high rates (although they will be lower than when we finished 2023), inflation still far away from 2%, and low growth (for longer).\n\nOne of the clearest aspects is that the most conservative savers/investors benefit greatly from the interest rate normalization we have seen. Fixed income again offers attractive returns with a controlled level of risk. In equities, there will continue to be winners and losers in the current environment, where active management and selection of sectors and securities will continue to be fundamental, although the entry point today is somewhat worse than a year ago, after a very positive year 2023.\n\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, intervention rates would have reached their peak after a rise of 525 basis points in the US. States and 450 in the Eurozone, a rise that has been particularly rapid and intense. Central banks' balance sheets will continue to shrink (from highs, they accumulate -11% in the Fed and -21% in the ECB) but gradually, to control episodes of financial instability. It seems that inflation has hit its peak and will continue to moderate, but the target 2% will be difficult to reach, and if necessary, would be still far away (2025 at best), with possible ups and downs along the way. The underlying CPI remains below the inflation targets of 2%, and the de-inflationary path will have \"potholes\". Potential sources of inflationary pressure are energy prices (geopolitical risk) wages (still strong labour markets), and regionally, housing in the United States, and services in the Eurozone. In the medium term, it must be borne in mind that there are structural inflationary pressures (deglobalization, de-carbonization, demographics). Despite this, the market is discounting the start of rate reductions in Q2-24 by the Fed, with a total for 2024 of 5-6 falls and 125-150 basis points, reaching at the end of 2024 4.0-4.25% in the USA and 2.75-3.0% in Europe. They may be overly optimistic expectations, and the adjustment process may be slower than expected. \"Neutral\" levels would be around 3% in the United States, and 2-2.5% in the Eurozone, and would take longer to reach.\n\nFrom an economic growth point of view, after a 2023 in which the dreaded recession has been averted, the most likely scenario is a smooth landing, with weak growth (c.1% for developed economies), a slowdown compared to 2023, suffering the full impact of rate hikes and more restrictive financial conditions that will have an impact on investment and consumption. Fiscal policies will not contribute to growth, as high levels of debt and rising costs require fiscal consolidation.\n\nHowever, there are geographical divergences. In the United States, following stronger-than-expected growth in 2023 (thanks to the labour market and private consumption), the chances of a smooth landing in 2024 are increasing, where labour market developments will be key. Europe, for its part, will remain stagnant, with countries such as Germany having the greatest dependence on energy and China. In China, the housing bubble will continue to drain growth. Without structural reforms to boost productivity, it is difficult to recover past growth. In Spain, GDP is expected to slow down (to 1.5-1.7%), affected by household consumption, slowing down through moderation of employment and wages. We therefore consider for 2024 a central scenario of weak economic growth, but without falling into recession. We do not think that the Fed will activate balance sheet expansion (QE) again, except in the case of a real catastrophe in the economy and, if rates really fall from 5.25% to 4.0-4.5%, we do not feel this will result in a big monetary boost. It is a scenario that could be called \"orderly disinflation\", with soft landing followed by prolonged low growth, and with the question of how far inflation will fall.\n\nGeopolitical risks and possible \"black swans\". Geopolitical risks remain: An escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict (potential extension to the entire Middle East?), in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or China's stance on Taiwan. These are possible \"black swans\" of a binary nature and impossible to predict with certainty. Any of these scenarios would be very negative for global financial markets, causing volatility and increasing risk premiums. On the other hand, recent events will only serve to reinforce certain trends that were already evident\n\nbefore the current crisis. National security, energy, food, cyber security, which are now much higher on the agendas of governments and businesses than in the past decade. In addition to geopolitical conflicts, we must remember the 2024 elections: Taiwan (January), European Parliament (May), and presidential elections in the United States (November). Any combination of political mistakes, global events and domestic policies could turn an economic slowdown into a worse scenario, or stimulate inflation. To achieve a modest slowdown followed by a modest recovery, central banks will have to keep these opposing forces under control.\n\nScenario and prospects in equities. We believe that the process of major economic transformation and adjustment initiated in 2022 will continue in 2024-25. After the shock of 2022, where markets discounted the magnitude of the adjustments to be made (which resulted in a significant contraction of multiples), in 2023 we witnessed a \"relief rally\", discounting that a major depression or deep recession is avoidable (we are not facing a scenario of Great Depression or stagflation), which translated into multiples expansion (greater in the United States than Europe). Looking ahead to 2024, the consequence for the markets of the macro scenario described, would be exchanges in a wide lateral range, slightly bullish or bearish, but with many divergences between companies and sectors, as has happened in 2022 and 2023. We therefore expect a year of consolidation, but with divergence in value creation, where active management and selection of values will remain essential.\n\nThere are mixed signals about the direction of the economy and monetary policies. But when we talk about equities, we need to focus on the evolution of business profits. The last year has been positively surprising because of the resistance of the results to the economic slowdown, and the absence of the much feared recession (average growth of 4% BPA in Europe and 2% in the United States). In 2022, despite the equity correction, profits also grew. For 2024, in Europe the market expects a moderate growth of BPA (+5%), picking up the greatest weakness of demand and deterioration of the cycle, lower\n\nprice-setting power, and higher financial expenses. In the case of S&P 500, the market expects low double-digit growth (+11%). However, the level of profits in Europe in 2024e would be 20-25% higher than in 2021, and in the United States 18-20%. This compares to an S&P 500 that is at the same levels as in December 2021, and a Stoxx 600 slightly below.\n\nValuation levels can be considered neutral at a global level (with greater attractiveness in Europe compared to the United States), in line with longterm historical multiples. In Europe, multiples expansion has been limited in 2023, and the factors explaining positive returns in the year are more balanced (slight multiples expansion, growth in profits c.4%, and profitability per dividend). The starting point is a PER 12m of 13x, a discount of c.7% versus the average since 2000 (14x PER12m). In the United States, in 2023 there has been an expansion of multiples (recovering the compression of 2022), being the main factor explaining the revaluation in 2023 (BPA has grown only 2%). The starting point is a PER 12m of 19x, a premium of 14% compared to the average since 2000 (16.6x profits from the next 12 months). However, the high weight of the 7 technology companies with the highest weight in the S&P hides a very reasonable valuation of 15-16x PER24e for the rest of the index, which provides more support in terms of valuation than it initially seems. Valuations are not as demanding if we look at metrics such as FCF yield, with a greater weight in the indices of companies with lighter business models and greater capacity to convert to free cash.\n\n# <span id=\"page-91-0\"></span>Evolution of the sector\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>Therefore, taking into account the two key factors (profits and multiples), the a priori scenario in the United States is that of higher profit growth, but with a higher starting multiple, and Europe with a more attractive valuation, but less profit growth. With a stable multiple and fulfilment of the profit estimate, we would reach near double-digit returns in S&P 500, perhaps with a more balanced contribution between sectors than the one seen in the last financial year (less differential between the \"magnificent seven\" and the rest of S&P). And in Europe, with a slight multiples expansion of 5-10% and growth in low singledigit profits, we would reach the same near-double-digit profitability. Part of the market considers that E of \"earnings\" optimistic The delayed effects of interest rate increases and still restrictive financial conditions will be key to profit adjustment. On the other hand, the forecasts of margin expansion could be optimistic (in a context where there are still inflationary and wage pressures, and perhaps less price-setting capacity). In our base scenario (no recession), we do not contemplate a fall in profits.\n\nRegarding emerging, attractive valuations, along with monetary and fiscal stimulus, and potential for improvement of profit estimates, should support good behaviour, China is one of the big doubts for this year. Furthermore, fiscal policy support, coupled with macro recovery, and reasonable valuations, could support the good performance of the region's companies. Latin America remains attractive thanks to its natural resources as a necessary supplier in the energy transition, digitalisation, etc. Its exposure to global growth would provide the continent with a positive option should we see a faster than anticipated economic recovery.\n\nQuality and growth vs. value. After a 2022 in which we saw a better performance \"value\" versus \"growth\", in 2023 we saw the opposite, with a flight toward quality and growth.\n\nWe still believe that there should not be a binary or exclusive approach. On the one hand, we see how \"megatrends\" continue to gain importance. As long-term investors, we believe it is convenient to focus on such trends, great forces in human and technological development with the power to transform the economy, business and society. Identifying structural change and investment at an early stage is critical to positioning portfolios for long-term growth opportunities. Clearly, we believe that innovation and technology will increase efficiency and productivity. Artificial intelligence, migration to the cloud, robotics, quantum computing, cybersecurity and software are sectors that will continue to grow above the average of the global economy. In health, the development of medical technology, research in obesity and diabetes, oncology, Alzheimer's, or genomic innovation. In the environment, energy efficiency, clean energy, waste management, water treatment, packaging and sustainable transport. At the same time, we continue to see traditional market segments that are undervalued, generate good returns and are at attractive valuation levels: some industrial niches, raw materials or energy are good examples.\n\nOn the other hand, stability and visibility in results is one of the characteristics of quality investment, and in this environment, such companies should better mitigate current risks. In this context, the selection of securities becomes more important, we believe that there will continue to be a search for quality in equities. It is therefore a particularly good time to hold quality compounders, companies that can grow earnings steadily through the cycles, thanks to their good positioning in more resilient sectors, their recurring revenues and pricing power, with greater consistency of earnings in difficult times. We see especially attractive sectors that historically have been considered more defensive, such as health sector or stable consumption, where in addition to the visibility of their income, currently contribute to a relatively attractive valuation (compared to the market and its history). It is essential to adopt a bottom-up approach to analysis, looking for high quality companies at reasonable prices with the potential to generate solid revenues and performance over economic cycles. We believe that, in the current environment, active management is crucial to generate profitable growth in portfolios, and especially useful in helping investors maintain a quality bias when navigating potentially volatile market terrain ahead.\n\nWith regard to fixed income, following the intense tightening of monetary policy by central banks and the consequent increase in public debt returns, we believe that this market presents investment opportunities with attractive returns. The prospect of rate reductions has led us to increase the duration somewhat. In this market segment, moreover, we consider the bonds of supranational organisations to be particularly attractive, offering yields in some cases higher than those of the Spanish government with better credit quality. Likewise, we believe that it is appropriate to take advantage of the distortions that technical factors (supply/demand) cause in the market, having found occasions in which, for example, the profitability of the French debt was more attractive than that of the Spanish one, despite having a better credit rating.\n\nWe also consider the levels of corporate debt investment grade attractive. We believe that the current levels are an opportunity to keep improving the credit quality of the portfolio. However, following the tightening of credit spreads at the end of 2023, we believe that they will expand throughout 2024. In any case, this will be more than compensated for by falls in public debt rates. Therefore, we believe that investment grade corporate debt offers an attractive return that protects us, in addition, from a scenario of greater economic deterioration than expected. On the high yield side, we are very cautious given the scenario of macro uncertainty we are facing, and we expect default levels to increase.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nGrupo Renta 4 net profit in 2023 amounted to €26.6 million, 21.9% higher than the previous year.\n\nThe CET1 Fully Loaded capital ratio is 18.62%, which is well above the regulatory requirement.\n\nReturn on Capital (ROE) is far higher than the sector average, reaching 18.8% return on invested capital.\n\nThese high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios that allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.\n\nThe commercial activity in 2023 has developed very satisfactorily, registering a significant growth in the acquisition of assets and in the number of customers.

Also indicate the specific measures taken by the Board of Directors and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee to ensure a balanced and diverse ratio of directors.\n\nShould the company not have a diversity policy in place, explain the reasons for it.\n\nDescription of policies, targets, measures and way they have been implemented, as well as their outcome.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 33.2 of the Articles of Association, Article 9.3 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors (the \"Board Regulations\") stipulates that \"the Board of Directors shall ensure that the procedures for the selection of its members favour diversity in terms of matters related to age, gender, different abilities, knowledge, training or professional experience, and do not suffer from any implicit bias that could imply any discrimination and, in particular, that they facilitate the appointment of female directors in such a number that enables a balance representation of men and women in the Company, always in support of the interests of the Company\". The Board of Directors has entrusted this function to the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (\"ARC\") as described in Article 32.3(g) of the Board Regulations, where it indicates, among other functions assigned to the ARC, that it should \"Ensure that the director appointment procedures do not discriminate in terms of gender diversity, set a representation target for the least represented gender and prepare guidelines on how to reach such target\".\n\nThroughout 2023, the CNR, in application of diversity policies and at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the General Shareholders Meeting (March 2023) agreed, along with the re-election of Mr José Ramon Rubio Laporta, the re-election of Ms. Gemma Aznar Cornejo as an independent director for a four-year term.\n\n**C.1.6 Explain any measures that may have been agreed by the appointments committee to prevent any implicit bias in selection procedures to hinder the selection of female board members, and for the company to deliberately strive to include women who meet the professional profile sought among the candidates and that will enable a balanced ratio of men and women. Also indicate whether these measures include encouraging the company to have a significant number of senior female managers:**\n\n#### Explanation of the measures\n\nArticle 9.3 of the Board Regulations provides that the Board must ensure that the procedures for the selection of its members favour diversity with respect to matters such as age, gender, different abilities or knowledge, training and professional experience, and do not suffer from implicit biases that could imply any discrimination and, in particular, that they facilitate the appointment of female Directors in a number that allows a balanced presence of women and men in the Company, all in the best interests of the Company. In this regard, the Board of Directors has entrusted the CNR with the responsibility of ensuring that the procedures for the selection of directors do not discriminate on the basis of age and gender diversity, establishing a representation target for the underrepresented sex; and to prepare guidelines on how to achieve this target in accordance with the provisions of article 32.3.g) of the Board Regulations.\n\nIn turn, Article 32 of the Board Regulations and, in order to avoid any implicit bias in the procedures for selecting the members of the Board of Directors that might hinder and/or prevent the selection of Female Directors, provides that the ARC shall: (i) Evaluate the skills, knowledge and experience required by the Board of Directors, defining, as a consequence, the functions and skills required by the candidates to fill each vacancy and evaluating the time and dedication required to properly perform their duties. Any director may request the CNR to take into consideration, if he considers them suitable, potential candidates to fill vacancies of director; and (ii) to ensure that the procedures for the selection of directors do not discriminate on the basis of age and diversity gender, establishing a goal of representation for the under-represented sex, and developing guidance on how to achieve this goal.\n\nThe ARC has aimed to, by establishing the goals and basic principles applied to the director selection process and a series of conditions that the candidates must meet, in line with the director Selection Policy:\n\na) Encourage diversity and integration of knowledge, experience and gender.\n\nb) Reach a suitable balance on the Board of Directors that will enrich the decision-making and contribute plural points of view to the debates on the matters under its domain; and\n\nc) The proposals for appointment and re-appointment of directors must be based on a prior analysis of the needs of the Board. As a result, the ARC prepared the proposed Policy for the Selection of Directors based on the principles of diversity and balance in the composition of the Board of Directors, which was approved by the Board of Directors. In application of this policy, the ARC, for the 2023 financial year, carried out the evaluation procedure for the renewal of appointments of Gema Aznar Cornejo and José Ramon Rubio Laporta, as independent directors, in order to maintain the diversity of the Board of Directors, concluding, in the re-election of the aforementioned directors in March 2023.\n\nWhen, despite the measures adopted, there are few or no female directors or leadership positions, explain the reasons:\n\nExplanation of the reasons\n\nThe CNR, in order to continue applying the good practices in corporate governance pursued by the Company and, in particular, those related to gender diversity within the Board of Directors has re-elected, among others, Ms Gemma Aznar Cornejo. Of course, the Company will continue working along these lines, promoting diversity on the Board of Directors and prohibiting the existence of discrimination or bias in the selection of directors, especially those related to the gender of the potential candidate. The foregoing only makes it easier for the composition of the Company's Board to be even more in line with the trends, best practices and guidelines of good corporate governance.\n\nLikewise, the Company continues to apply gender diversity policies within its internal structure.\n\n**C.1.7 Explain the conclusions of the appointments committee on the verification of compliance with the policy aimed at favouring an appropriate composition of the board of directors.**\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee established the basic principles and/or guidelines on which the policy for the appointment of directors should be based, contained in the Policy for the Selection of Directors which was approved by the Board of Directors. Said Policy, based on the principles of diversity and balance in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors, is expressly aimed at favouring diversity and integration of knowledge, experience and gender, seeking to facilitate the appointment of female directors in a number that allows a balanced presence of women and men in the Company, all in the best interests of the Company.\n\nThe members of the ARC issued a positive report on the Company's corporate governance policies, which expressly foresees that the Board should ensure that the member selection procedures should foster diversity of gender, experience and knowledge, and be free of any implicit bias that may lead to discrimination and, in particular should facilitate the appointment of female directors.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the activity of the ARC has focused particularly on the application of these policies, proposing to the General Shareholders Meeting in 2023 the re-election of Ms Gemma Aznar Cornejo and José Ramon Rubio Laporta as independent directors of the Society, this being approved in March.\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/25 description: The image contains the number 106 in white font on a blue background.

State the mechanisms established to detect, determine and resolve any conflicts of interest between the company and/or the group, directors, managers, significant shareholders or other associated parties.**\n\nArticles 17 to 20a of the Board's Regulations establish the Company's mechanisms for detecting, determining and resolving possible conflicts of interest, as well as the regime of related transactions. Thus, the aforementioned article 17 establishes that \"there is a conflict of interest in those situations in which the interest of the Company, or of the integrated companies, collides, directly or indirectly in his group, and the personal interest of the director\", the latter being understood as cases in which the matter affects him or a person connected to him.\n\nThe following are persons related to the individual director: a) spouse or persons with a marriage-like relationship; b) the ancestors, descendants and siblings of the director or his/her spouse (or person with a marriage-like relationship); c) Spouses of the ancestors, descendants or siblings; d) Companies in which, itself or through a third party, fall into one of the situations described in Article 42.1 of the Spanish Commercial Code.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nSituations of conflict of interest will be governed by the following rules: a) Disclosure: the Director will inform all other Directors and, if appropriate, the Board, through the Chairman or the Secretary, of any conflict of interest pertaining the Director or his/her related persons; b) Abstention: the Director may not carry out any professional or commercial transactions, whether directly or indirectly, with the Company unless he/she has first disclosed the conflict of interest and the Board has approved the transaction. The Director will refrain from attending and taking part in the deliberation and vote for such matters. Regarding proprietary Directors, these must refrain from taking part in the vote for matters that could entail a conflict of interest between the shareholders they represent and the Company; c) Transparency: Disclose in the annual report and in the Annual Corporate Governance Report of any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Internal Conduct Regulations (ICR) governs conflicts of interest in Articles 21, 22 and 23. In this regard, \"there will be a conflict of interest between the Company and one of its clients or between two of the Company's clients when, in a given situation, the Company may gain a benefit, provided that there is also a potential correlative damage to the client, or when the client could gain a profit or avoid a loss and there is the chance that another client will suffer a loss as a result\".\n\nTo identify these situations, it shall be determined whether the Company, a reporting party to the ICC ('Reporting Party to ICC') or another person directly or indirectly related to such person through a position of control, falls into any of the following situations: a) The Company or the relevant person may gain a financial benefit or avoid a financial loss at the client's expense; b) Has an interest in the outcome of the service provided or the transaction executed at the client's expense, other than the client's own interest; c) Has financial or other incentives to favour the interests of third-party clients, to the detriment of the interests of the client in question; d) The professional activity is identical to the client's; e) Receives, or is due to receive, an incentive from a third party based on the service provided to the client, in cash, goods or services, other than the usual fee or compensation for the service in question.\n\nThe Company may determine other conflicts of interest in which the Persons subject to ICR may be involved on account of family, financial, professional or other links. All employees and Subject Persons shall inform the Company, through the ICC Monitoring Body, of any personal or family, economic or any other type of the ICR Monitoring Body, of any personal or family situation, economic or otherwise, that may constitute a conflict between such person and those of a client of the Company or of the Company itself.\n\nThere will be a conflict of interest when the Person subject to ICR, or a person or entity who is a relative or is closely related to such person, falls into one of the following cases: a) Is a member of the Board of Directors or senior management of a company whose business purpose is the same as the Company's; b) Significant stake in companies whose business purpose is the same as the Company's; c) Significant stake or another type of personal interest in a client of the Company.\n\nPersons subject to ICR will refrain from taking part in preparations and in the decision or vote, and will inform the people who will be taking the relevant decision. Furthermore, they will inform portfolio management clients of any conflicts that may arise in the course of their activity. When in doubt on the existence of a conflict of interests, Persons subject to ICR are required to inform about this to the Body in charge of ensuring compliance with the ICR, as well as the specific circumstances of the operation to allow the Body to determine the appropriate steps.\n\nThe resolution of conflicts shall always be carried out under the following principles: 1. The legitimate interests of clients shall in all cases be the priority to consider, without prejudice to the due respect for the integrity of the market. 2. Efforts shall be made to minimise conflicts between clients and between the Company and its clients. 3. The interests of the Company shall not take precedence over those of the clients in transactions with identical characteristics.\n\n4. No client should be privileged when there is a conflict between several clients. 5. They will not multiply transactions unnecessarily and without benefit to the client.\n\n**D.7. Indicate whether the company is controlled by another entity within the meaning of Article 42 of the Commercial Code, whether listed or not, and whether it has, directly or through its subsidiaries, business relations with that entity or any of its subsidiaries (other than those of the listed company) or engages in activities related to those of any of them.**\n\nYes **No**\n\n#### **E. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS**\n\n**E.1. Describe the scope of the financial and non-financial Risk Management and Control System in place at the company, including tax risks:**\n\nThe different risks involved in the operations conducted by the Renta 4 Group are managed under the principle of prudence to preserve its solvency level, profitability, efficiency and appropriate liquidity. Renta 4 Group has an ongoing management and control system for the risks taken in its business, expanding to all the companies in the Group, as well as all the areas or business units, with special focus on those that are more sensitive to the risks inherent in the business.\n\n**E.2. Identify the bodies responsible for preparing and implementing the financial and non-financial Risk Management and Control System, including tax risks:**\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Approval of the risk control and management policy [financial and non-financial], including tax risks, identifying the main risks faced by the Company and implementing, supervising and monitoring the internal information and control systems.\n\n#### **AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Supervise the efficiency of the Company's internal control, the risk management systems, including tax risks, the management of internal audit services that ensure the good performance of the internal information and control systems, especially related to the reporting processes in terms of accuracy and filing the regulated financial information on the Company and its group, check compliance with the regulatory requirements, the appropriate limits on the scope of consolidation and the right use of the accounting criteria, reporting this to the Board of Directors. The person in charge of the internal audit is required to present before the Committee his/ her guidance and work planning for their approval and make sure that the activity is fundamentally focused on the material risks faced by the Company and directly inform the Committee of any incidents that may arise in its course, as well as present the Committee with a report on its activities at the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, the Audit and Control Committee will discuss with the Auditor any material weaknesses identified in the internal control system during the audit.\n\n- Supervise the procedure followed to prepare and file the regulatory financial and non-financial information and the internal risk management and control systems related to the Company's significant risks for them to be identified (operational, technological, financial, legal or reputational), managed and reported appropriately, setting the risk level tolerated by the Company, the measures needed to minimise the impact of the risks identified, and determine the control and information systems to be used to control and manage them, ensure the independence and efficiency of the internal auditing unit, propose the selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the head of the internal audit service, and the budget of such service, receive regular information on its activities and check that the senior management takes into account the conclusions and recommendations in the reports.\n\n- Supervise the development of the functions assigned to the area in charge of preventing money laundering and know the reports and proposals presented in this regard.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **INTERNAL AUDIT**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- Revise the procedures and systems established for risk control.\n\n#### **RISK DEPARTMENT**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- This body reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n- The Risk department carries out its functions on all the entities included in the scope of consolidation of the Renta 4 Group and is in charge of monitoring the established risk control systems.\n\n#### **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT.**\n\nDescription of its functions:\n\n- This body reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n- The regulatory compliance function aims, among others, to establish, implement and maintain appropriate measures and procedures to detect any risk of non-compliance by the entity.\n\n**E.3. Specify the main risks, including the financial and non-financial tax risks and, where significant, risks derived from corruption (as described in the Spanish Royal Decree 18/2017) that may jeopardise the business targets:**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group consists of a group of companies devoted to providing special services for savings and investments and is independent of any other financial or industrial group. For this reason, it is particularly exposed to the progress of the financial industry as it can have a significant impact on its results.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the basic risks that may affect the Renta 4 Group are as follows:\n\n1. Credit risk: Credit risk is defined as the possibility of experiencing losses when a debtor violates its contractual duties, including the counterparty risk.\n\n2. Market risk: Market risk is the possibility of experiencing losses on account of adverse fluctuations in the price of the assets that make up the trading portfolio of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n3. Operational risk: Operational risk refers to potential loss arising from inadequate or failed procedures, employee mistakes and internal system errors or due to external events, in particular, natural catastrophes, mistakes made by price and information suppliers or hacking into technological systems that could jeopardise the infrastructure of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n4. Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk refers to, as its name indicates, a shortage of cash, usually resulting from an imbalance in cash inflows and outflows.\n\n5. Regulatory risk: This risk refers to the likelihood of experiencing loss as a result of failing to adjust Renta 4 Group's policies to the regulations governing its operations, of poorly documented operations or of claims and actions against the Group.\n\n6. Reputational risk: Reputational risk arises from Renta 4 Group's actions that could lead to negative publicity regarding its business practices and connections. This could entail the loss of trust in the Group and therefore impact its solvency.\n\n7. Tax risk: Tax risk is the threat of a negative impact on the financial statements and/or the Renta 4 Group's reputation as a result of tax-related decisions made by the entity or the legal or tax authorities.\n\n8. Technological risks: Risks arising from a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability associated with systems or data; or from the inability to change Information and Communication Technology in a reasonable time and cost when the environment or business requirements change. This includes security risks resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from external events including cyber attacks or inadequate physical security.\n\n9. ESG or sustainability risk. Environmental, social and governance risks that, because they are considered material, both in the short and long term, may generate economic losses or negatively impact its capital and/or liquidity. Climate change and environmental degradation can manifest in financial risks through basically two transmission channels: physical risks and transition risks. Social risks are related to labour conditions, local communities, employee health and safety and discrimination, among others. Governance risks relate to executive remuneration, respect for the rule of law, bribery and corruption, fiscal strategy, cybersecurity and money laundering, among others.\n\n**E.4. State whether the entity has risk tolerance levels, including fiscal risks.**\n\nRenta 4 Group's risk management strategy is based on implementing measures that will minimise or dilute the risks defined, setting specific limits for each business line, market and product.\n\nThe purpose of this system is to protect the Group's solvency and liquidity ensuring that the exposure to the risk is within the predefined limits and has a balanced profile.\n\nThe Renta 4 Group has a Risk Appetite Framework that establishes limits for the main risks attached to its operations.\n\n**E.5. Indicate which financial and non-financial risks, including fiscal risks, have emerged during the financial year.**\n\nNo risks materialised during the fiscal year.\n\n**E.6. Explain any response and supervision plans in place for the entity's main risks, including fiscal risks, as well the procedures followed by the company to ensure that the Board of Directors can respond to coming challenges.**\n\nThe measures to mitigate the impact of the basic risks that may affect the Renta 4 Group (the \"Group\"), should they materialise, are described below:\n\n**1. Credit risk:** To mitigate this risk, specific procedures and limits are established to avoid situations of overdraft of cash and/ or securities in the intermediation and settlement of client transactions. Exceptionally, there may be certain situations where this shortage is allowed when duly authorised. These situations are limited according to the client's credit guarantee and are monitored by the Risk Department and the Audit Unit. Renta 4 grants financing to clients through the signing of a credit agreement secured by securities, and, through the pledging of financial instruments and the continuous monitoring of their evolution, the risk assumed in the transactions granted to clients is hedged. Exposure to the credit risk in balance-sheet exposure is largely focused on cash investments (current accounts, deposits and Spanish short-term sovereign debt) all this in line with the limits on portfolio\n\nconcentration set forth in the current regulations. The assessment of counterparty risk against credit institutions is made on the basis of ratings from the main agencies that provide this information, selecting those with the highest solvency, experience and recognition in the market.\n\n**2. Market risk:** To control these types of risks, limits are established so that, at all times, in the event of variations in market prices, losses are limited to the pre-set maximums. The established controls are set depending on the conditions of the different assets and the relevance of the risk attached to each market. Within this type of risk, the Value at Risk or maximum potential loss that a portfolio may experience under the current market conditions is especially significant and is included in the risk detection systems. The Risk Department and the Audit Unit are in charge of supervising compliance with the established limits.\n\n**3. Operational risk:** To mitigate this risk, the Company has imposed minimum training requirements on employees, in addition to primary controls in the different workstations, so that control routines are integrated into each task developed. The improvements made to computer systems contribute to tightening control and reducing the number of manual processes which in turn reduces the likelihood of human error. The Risk Department and the Audits Unit are constantly monitoring and assessing any risks derived from possible mistakes, mainly arising from brokerage transactions for clients, checking that the control system works correctly. A governance model has been defined and implemented that covers the main areas of technological risk management, and includes a control framework to monitor them for internal and external management and reporting.\n\n**4. Liquidity risk:** In order to control this risk and to comply with all the requirements established in the legislation regarding legal ratios and payment commitments with third parties, the residual maturities of assets and liabilities are reviewed. The monitoring and control of the liquidity risk is undertaken by the Cash and Banks Dept. on a daily basis working with the Finances Dept. and supervised by the Risk Dept. of the Group. In any case, the policy to mitigate this risk focuses on the current policy of investing in short-term and liquid assets that could be available in the event of any stress that could materialise.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5. Regulatory risk:** The Group has a Regulatory Compliance Unit responsible for adapting procedures to regulatory requirements, as well as monitoring and controlling their correct application.\n\n**6. Reputational risk:** The Group has established a series of regulatory compliance policies, through which it directly monitors the most significant aspects that may cause this risk, which include, but are not limited to: Prevention of Money Laundering • Internal Regulation of Conduct • Marketing of Products and MIFID II, MIFIR and PRIIPs Regulations • Market Abuse in the Capital Markets • Customer Claims • Criminal Risk Management Model • Protection of Personal Data\n\n**7. Tax risk:** The impact of this risk is mitigated by independent expert actions within the framework of the financial audit, fiscal opinions requested within the framework of relevant transactions and, ultimately, by interaction with the Tax Administration.\n\n**8. Technological risk:** a technological risk management model has been defined based on the governance model and the operational model that makes it possible to clearly establish the responsibilities and competencies in technological risk management, including the main governing bodies, as well as the internal regulations and the main technological risk management processes.\n\n**9. ESG risks:** The Group integrates these risks into its current procedures, adopting a global approach for their identification, evaluation, monitoring and mitigation, specifically in relation to sustainable finance, incorporating ESG criteria in the product catalogue, implementing ESG advice and management preferences for clients, reporting the actions carried out, developing processes and methodology for environmental risk management and adapting favourable capital treatments to ESG-related exposures.\n\n## **F. INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)**\n\nDescribe the mechanisms that comprise the risk control and management systems in relation to internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) at your company.\n\n#### **F.1. The company's control environment.**\n\nProvide information, stating the main features, on at least the following:\n\n**F.1.1 Which bodies and/or units are responsible for (i) the existence and maintenance of a proper ICFR system; (ii) its implementation; and (iii) its supervision**\n\n#### **BOARD OF DIRECTORS.**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco is ultimately in charge of the implementation and maintenance of an appropriate and effective ICFR which, in line with its Regulations, it entrusts to the Audit and Control Committee.\n\n#### **AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE.**\n\nThe Regulations of the Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco, in their Article 31, foresee that the basic duties of the Audit and Control Committee in connection with the internal information and control systems are as follows:\n\n1.Supervise the effectiveness and the management of the internal auditing services in the Company that will ensure the good performance of the internal information and control systems, especially related to the preparation processes in terms of accuracy and filing the regulated financial information on the Company and its group, checking compliance with regulatory requirements, the appropriate limits on the scope of consolidation and the right use of the accounting criteria, and reporting this to the Board of Directors.The person in charge of the internal audit is required to present before the Committee his/her yearly work planning and directly inform the Committee of any incidents that may arise in its course, as well as report to the Committee on its activities at the end of each fiscal year.\n\n2.Supervise the process followed to prepare and file the regulated financial information and the internal risk management and control systems related to the Company's significant risks for them to be identified (operational, technological, financial, legal or reputational), managed and reported appropriately, setting the risk level tolerated by the Company, the measures needed to minimise the impact of the risks identified, and determine the control and information systems to be used to control and manage them, ensure the independence and efficiency of the internal auditing unit, propose the selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the head of the internal audit service, and the budget of such service, receive regular information on its activities and check that the senior management takes into account the conclusions and recommendations in the reports.\n\n3.Check the Company's accounts, ensure compliance with the legal requirements and the right use of the standard accounting principles, and inform about the proposals to change the accounting principles and criteria suggested by the management.\n\n4.Previously review and report to the Board of Directors about: (i) financial information that, being listed, the Company is to disclose on a regular basis, making sure that the interim statements are prepared following the same accounting criteria as the yearly statements and, for such purposes, consider if it is convenient to request a limited review from the Company's external auditor; (ii) the issue or purchase of shares in entities with a special purpose or based in countries or jurisdictions that are considered tax havens, as well as any other transaction or operation of a similar nature that, due to its complexity, could hinder the transparency of the group to which the Company belongs; (iii) and of linked operations.\n\n5.Receive from employees, confidentially but not anonymously, written communications on possible irregularities with a potential relevance, especially financial or accounting ones, that they may detect in the Company or its group companies.\n\n6.Ensure compliance with the internal codes of conduct and the rules of corporate governance as well as the regulations on markets in the industry.\n\n7.Supervise the development of the functions assigned to the area in charge of preventing money laundering and know the reports and proposals presented in this regard.

(the Parent Company) and its group subsidiaries, hereinafter Renta 4, issues this Statement of Non-financial Information for the financial year 2023 as an annex to the Consolidated Management Report presented with the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nThis report is public and can be consulted on the corporate website *https://www.renta4banco.com/es*\n\nRenta 4 has analysed the requirements of Law 11/2018, taking into account the opinion of its main stakeholders. To this end, the Group has identified the following stakeholders: customers, professionals, shareholders, the environment and suppliers.\n\nThe Renta 4 Group's business model, based on proximity and relationship with society, through the provision of products, services and investment solutions allows for continuous access to these stakeholders by all operating lines, control areas (risks, regulatory compliance, and internal audit), and, especially, senior management and members of the Board of Directors, who are fully aware of the most relevant aspects in the economic, social and environmental fields.\n\nThis continuous interrelationship means the company gets to know each stakeholder's needs to establish lines of action, responding to them in a timely manner.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. is ultimately responsible for all aspects arising from the management and control of the risks inherent to the activity carried out by Renta 4. Thus, at the request of the Board of Directors, a Risk Appetite Framework, different risk management policies, and risk control structures have been set up to ensure their correct application.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework is a statement of the aggregate level of risk types that Renta 4 is willing to accept or avoid to achieve its business purposes. It is also a tool that uses metrics to monitor each of the risks, establishing different policies for appropriate risk management.\n\nTherefore, the Risk Appetite Framework includes a commitment to economic and social sustainability, especially emphasising compliance with policies for the prevention of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism, ESG, regulatory compliance, the code of conduct in stock markets (Internal Code of Conduct) and the handling of customers' complaints.\n\nAs shown in Annex I, *\"Table of contents required by Law 11/2018, of 28 December\",* the NFIR has been prepared following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards selected, for those requirements considered material for the business.\n\nThe scope of the information reported covers Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (the parent company) and its subsidiaries for the year 2023, both nationally and internationally.\n\n# <span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>Basis for the preparation of the non-financial information statement\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 is composed of a number of companies dedicated to the provision of investment and asset management services, and Renta 4 Banco S.A. is the parent company. The most representative companies in terms of income and services offered within the Group are the following:\n\n- **Renta 4 Banco S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Pensiones SGFP S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 S.V. S.A.**\n- **Renta 4 Corporate S.A.**\n\nRenta 4 operates mainly in the national territory, although a non-significant part of its activity is carried out in Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Luxembourg with similar customers and products offered in all the countries. Apart from physical offices, the other channel through which Renta 4 provides services to its customers is the online broker.\n\n#### The Group's main business lines are as follows:\n\n• Brokerage: Activities of buying and selling securities and other financial instruments on national and international securities markets.\n\n• Asset management and marketing: Management of CIIs, ECIs, ECRs and pension funds managed by the managing entities of the group; discretionary management of portfolios, either those of the managers of the group or of third party managers; and marketing of CIIs, ECIs, ECRs, alternative investments and pension funds, managed by the entity itself and third parties.\n\n• Corporate and other services: Services to companies and other activities not included in the previous lines of business. This segment includes the activities of securities deposit, CII depository, corporate advice, assurance and placement of issues and public offers, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe Renta 4 business model offers quality financial services to investors and savers by providing specialised independent advice and the best products available in the market, to meet their needs.\n\nIn December 2021, a new Strategic Plan called \"Plan More\" was communicated to the market with the aim of starting, from 2022, a new stage of growth in Renta 4 Banco. With the new Plan, there is an evolution in the activity of the Bank, which starts to offer traditional banking services (cards, payments and collections, direct debit, receipts, deposits, etc.) and that directly affects the management of the balance sheet itself, although without losing sight of the position acquired as a bank specialising in investment services.\n\nThe model expansion aims to access new segments of customers, essentially young and new savers who want to invest, but who are not only looking for an investment product provider, but are looking for a bank that meets all the basic needs of a commercial bank (direct debit of payroll and receipts, card, payments and collections, tax payments, etc.).\n\nThis plan incorporates a series of initiatives focused mainly on growing in the retail segment of customers. A specialised and \"inclusive\" bank model is proposed for all types of customers, incorporating \"more\" product and \"more\" service, covering a greater number and diversity of customers, as an essential element to generate growth and value in the long term. The idea, therefore, is not to renounce the competitive difference that Renta 4 Banco has acquired as a benchmark in specialised investment services, but to expand offering, in a complementary way, traditional banking services to strengthen the business model.\n\nThe model extension has had an effect on the organisation of the Group, which has led to the creation of new areas such as: management of payment methods, bank-insurance operator. In addition, the functions of the treasury department have been expanded. A new business unit has been formed focused on the development of the Plan More, the brand image has been changed to give visibility to the strategic change and, in parallel, significant investment has been made in computer resources and media in order to join various platforms and have all the necessary capabilities to provide banking services and maintain a high and sustainable pace of growth.\n\n#### **1. Group Structure**\n\nThe activity of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. focuses mainly on the provision of investment and asset management services. The entity has a network of 67 offices, of which 63 are located in the main capitals and cities of the Spanish provinces, and the remaining 4 offices in the capital of each country listed above, with an average workforce of 657 workers in 2023.\n\nThe distribution network is complemented by sales agents and partners.\n\nIn addition, the Group has a website, www.r4.com,and an app for the main business unit, which make it possible for its customers to operate in national and international markets.\n\nIn addition, it has numerous customer support services, including; a telephone customer service with long customer service hours, permanent access to market news, analyst databases on companies from all major exchanges, alert services, access to technical comments and charting tools.\n\nIn the same way as the commercial area of the bank, other business units have their own websites, including:\n\n**www.renta4gestora.com,** for Renta 4 Gestora\n\n**www.renta4pensiones.com,** for Rent 4 Pensions\n\n**www.renta4banco.com,** for institutional information and shareholders\n\n**corporate.r4.com,** for the Renta 4 Corporate Finance website\n\n**wealth.r4.com,** for the Renta 4 Wealth Management website\n\nAnd other websites such as fundacionrenta4.org, blog.r4.com among others, for other areas and functions.\n\nInternationally, Renta 4 also has physical offices in Peru and Chile, in addition to offering the possibility to customers in these two regions to contract Renta 4 products through its own website. Furthermore, a representative office and a company dedicated to the trust business are established in Colombia. The international business of Renta 4 is completed by the CII management company in Luxembourg.\n\nBusiness units in international markets have their own websites:\n\n**www.renta4.cl,** for the Renta4 website in Chile\n\n**www.renta4.pe,** for the Renta website 4 in Peru\n\n**www.renta4global.com,** for the Renta website 4 in Colombia\n\n**www.renta4.lu,** for Renta 4 Luxembourg\n\n## **2. History of the entity**\n\nRenta 4 started in 1986 as an investment services company. In the beginning, it was dedicated to the purchase and sale of public debt. In 1989, the entity became a Securities and Exchange Company, registered as number 1 before the National Securities Market Commission, expanding the investment range from Public Debt to Stock Exchange Intermediation. In 1987 Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC, S.A. was established, but it was not until 1991 that the CII management activity began, constituting the first investment fund. Renta 4 Pensiones S.G.F.P. was established in 1997.\n\nIn the 1990s a process of opening new offices throughout Spain began, starting from the 3 existing in 1990 and continuing until the current distribution network was formed. The last office that Renta 4 opened was in November 2023 in Madrid, at Avenida del General Peron No. 26.\n\nIn 1999, the strategy of territorial expansion and the multi-channel philosophy led to the development of the online platform www.renta4.com, which allowed the outsourcing of products and services through the network.\n\nIn 1999, a holding company was set up under the name of Renta 4 Servicios Financieros, S.L., which aligned the businesses of CII management and pension funds. In 2000, the intermediation business was integrated into the holding company.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Renta 4 began a process to rationalise the network through the acquisition and subsequent merger of several companies in which agents of the Renta 4 Group participated, giving rise to a fully integrated commercial structure.\n\n# <span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>General Information\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the same period, the product offering was expanded to include the marketing of ETFs and derivatives.\n\nIn 2004, as part of the company's growth policy, Renta 4 Corporate was established while Gesdinco and Padinco were acquired in 2006.\n\nOn September 29, 2007, Renta 4 became the first investment services company to float on the stock exchange.\n\nIn 2012, Renta 4 began to function as a bank by acquiring bank status from Banco Alicantino de Comercio, S.A. and establishing the company Renta 4 Banco, S.A. As a result, Renta 4 Sociedad de Valores, S.A. was partially spun off in favour of Renta 4 Banco, S.A.\n\nLikewise, in 2012, the international expansion began in Chile, with Renta 4 Corredores de Bolsa, S.A. and, in 2013, it was expanded by opening offices in Peru and Colombia.\n\nIn 2014, there was another important milestone for the company by starting a process to make investment more accessible to citizens, moving all offices at street level and placing them in central streets of cities.\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) appointed Renta 4 Gestora, SGIIC, S.A. as the Provisional Managing Company of the CIIs that, until then, had been managed by Banco Madrid Asset Management, SGIIC, S.A. and that no longer performs this management.\n\nA management company for CIIs was established in Luxembourg in 2016.\n\n**1 To be a specialised bank** (in savings, investment, wealth and corporate services): because to be able to offer quality and excellence of service in a scalable way, it is necessary to focus the activity. To be the best in an activity and, based on this, to be \"A SPECIALISED INVESTMENT BANK\"\n\n**2 A bank devoted to its customers:** To establish a long-term relationship of trust based on an expert, efficient and personalised service for every investor. A premise that is expressed as \"A BANK WHERE EVERY INVESTOR IS AN IMPORTANT CUSTOMER\".\n\nThis business model with its brand allows Renta 4 to occupy a differential space on the map of banking or private banking entities.\n\nRenta 4 is a \"marketplace\" for investments, but with a full banking license, that is its differential value. It differs from the large universal banks in that it specialises in wealth management and capital markets. It differs from smaller, boutique investment houses in that it offers the customer a much more comprehensive range of solutions to customers' financial needs. This makes it possible to target a very broad segment of savers, from high net worth individuals to more modest investors or millennials. In short, it is a Bank with all the advantages of being a Bank, but operating as a specialised investment firm. This is why Renta 4 is a marketplace that aggregates investment solutions for a wide range of customers. There is no other bank specialised in investment listed on the Spanish stock exchange.\n\nThe business model must reinforce this differentiation as a key to its consistency and competitiveness. A model that, when it comes to people's savings and investments, bases its success and condition of permanence on building TRUST.\n\nRenta 4 has a slogan that conveys this idea: \"At Renta 4 we are not investment managers, we are investor managers. The interests of their customers are paramount. An investor wants to know that there will always be someone to turn to if they have a problem, know that what they invest in is right for them, know that their advisers know what they are talking about, know the quality and reputation of the products and services that Renta 4 offers, know that they are charged fairly, know that they are offered what suits them and not the entity (we are not product placers). This TRUST is transmitted through:\n\n**1 La cercanía: Accessibility:** The best way to transmit trust is through closeness, personal treatment, empathy, clear and transparent communication: knowing your customers WELL.\n\n**2 Experience:** The experience that comes from being specialised and having spent more than 35 years dedicating ourselves exclusively to this on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020 Renta 4 Gestora adhered to the United Nations Sustainable Investment Programme, the so-called PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment), whereby it undertakes to incorporate environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) in investment decision-making.\n\nIn December 2021 it launched the strategic growth plan called Plan MORE, to grow in products and services, segments and, ultimately, customers. With this plan, the company also made a change of brand identity that spread to all its channels and offices. In this period Renta 4 was a team to work specifically in the field of artificial intelligence and robotisation, developing solutions both to optimise internal operations and to offer new experiences to customers in this area.\n\nIn January 2023 Renta 4 joined the PRI as a Group and signed up to its sustainability objectives and the goal of decarbonisation, also joining the NZBA (Net Zero Banking Alliance). An action with which it aligned itself with a large number of banks in the race for the neutrality of this industry in CO2 emissions by 2030.\n\n#### **3. Purpose, mission and vision of the company**\n\nThe purpose of Renta 4 Banco is to democratise investment so that every person, family, company or institution can benefit equally from a high-quality service to operate in financial markets and manage savings and investments. In other words, to offer an exclusive service with an inclusive approach to help customers protect and make the most of their savings and investments while managing risk.\n\nIn the current context of the financial markets and the uncertainty facing the sector, it connects with the Bank's mission as a Bank and as an investment company, which is to encourage investment to improve people's lives. We are moving towards a world of investors in which investment can and must play an essential role in moving towards a more sustainable and efficient world, and contribute to the progress of society. The company wants to play an important role in this new financial system that will finance innovation and the positive transformation of the economy. And it will do so as it has always done, by allocating resources well and managing risks well, helping customers invest well and helping companies find the best financial solutions for their growth.\n\nThis vision is translated into a slogan that is communicated and disseminated internally (employees) and externally (society): \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE AND SOCIETY\".\n\nTo successfully accomplish its corporate purpose, Renta 4 has established a consistent business model, orchestrating strategies, structures, developments and activities, which can be summarised in two points:\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/27 description: The image contains the number 36 in white text on a green background.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3 Quality of service:** Because when it comes to money, every client wants to see that things are done well, with professionalism and experience, but also with caring and humanity. You have to be it and look like it.\n\nAnd finally, these values must be surrounded by other aspects that in the current context are complementary, but fundamental for adapting to today's society: its habits and expectations.\n\n**1 Technology:** A high-quality service requires a high level of efficiency, which is achieved only through technology, to make this model profitable, and therefore viable; but technology is also necessary to offer users convenient, fast and accessible experiences. Growth can only happen if integration between physical and digital channels is achieved.\n\n**2 Proactivity:** Renta 4 believes in anticipating customers' needs. The greatest satisfaction comes when you notice that solutions and ideas are provided for you. Talking to customers to better interpret what they really need and thus make investment decisions easier.\n\n**3 Pedagogy:** Considering the education and financial training of customers as a social responsibility and transferring it to all the contact points of the relationship. From the first communications to answering inquiries and providing information to in-person commercial processes at our offices.\n\n**4 Sustainability:** Beyond the idea of sustainable investment, banks occupy an important space in society and, as such, Renta 4 must play a significant and committed role in improving the sustainability of the planet.\n\n#### **Commitment To Sustainability**\n\nRenta 4's commitment to sustainability is a fundamental pillar of its company strategy. Its activity, focused on the world of investment and spanning more than three decades, is based on the fundamental mission of promoting the development of society and people through investment\n\nBut the mission goes further; we have the responsibility and commitment to promote sustainable and socially responsible investment practices, regardless of the size of investors' wealth.\n\nThe fundamental values, rooted in closeness, specialisation, independence have been reinforced over the years with a strong commitment to social and environmental impact. These principles are reflected in every action that is carried out, in every relationship that is established and in every decision that is made.\n\nOver the past few years, we have promoted concrete actions that reflect our firm intention to move forward on three priority aspects:\n\n**At the corporate level,** policies have been strengthened to promote equality in selection and recruitment processes, as well as the creation of a specialised committee on ESG (environmental, social and governance) aspects, actively monitoring initiatives related to sustainable investment.\n\n**As far as our customers and financial products** are concerned, Plan MORE has met with approval. This plan, among other objectives, focuses on promoting the development of themed and ESG investments. For Renta 4, each investor is unique, and the commitment goes beyond managing their investments; we want to understand their needs and aspirations to provide customised solutions that respond to the principles of responsible investment.\n\n**The commitment to society,** which is reflected in actions that combine commercial pedagogy with the execution of training activities in financial education. These initiatives are designed to bring financial\n\nknowledge closer to the local community, empowering individuals with tools for more informed and responsible decision-making.\n\nAs a company, Renta 4 aspires to be agents of change in the financial system, allocating resources responsibly and managing risks effectively. Through actions, it seeks to finance innovation and contribute to a positive transformation of the economy. The commitment is to deliver the best financial solutions that drive business growth while promoting a positive impact on society and the environment.\n\nCaring for the environment, social factors and good governance is not simply a part of the discourse; it is a fundamental pillar of business strategy. In every step that Renta 4 takes, it reaffirms its commitment to sustainability, not only with words, but with concrete actions and a positive impact that we seek to leave on society and the planet.\n\n#### **4. Main figures of the entity**\n\nAt the end of 2023, Renta 4 obtained a net profit of 26.6 million euros, 21.9% higher than the previous year. The total assets of customers total 30,852 million euros, of which 19,155 million euros relate to its own network, while 11,697 million euros relate to the third-party network.\n\nLatin America's subsidiaries continue to maintain a satisfactory level of business and activity, jointly contributing 10.2% of the result to the consolidated Group.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total number of customers had reached 124,995.\n\nThe CET1 Fully Loaded capital ratio is around 18.62%, which is well above the regulatory requirement. Return on equity (ROE) is far higher than the sector average, reaching an 18.8% return on invested equity.\n\nThese high levels of profit, ROE and solvency ratios allow us to maintain a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration.\n\nCommercial activity in 2023 registered a significant growth in the acquisition of assets and in the number of customers. The net uptake of new assets by the own network in this year has been 2,511 million euros.\n\nThe equity of customers in assets under management (investment funds, FCR, SICAVs, SILs, SCRs and pension funds) increased by 1,753 million euros compared to the same period of the previous year, reaching 12,228 million euros.\n\nThe assets managed in investment funds and CFRs amount to 4,050 million euros, increasing by 671 million euros during the 2023 financial year. There were 916 million euros managed in SICAVs, SILs and SCRs 21.5% more and in pension funds 3,909 million euros, representing a growth of 16.1% compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nAs a general assessment, 2023 was a very positive financial year for the Group, both from the point of view of the results achieved, and especially for the significant figure recorded in attracting new assets from customers in its own network.\n\nAll lines of business have evolved adequately, despite a negative environment in market volumes and corporate operations, especially regarding the growth of assets under management and the number of customers, reflecting a growing market confidence in our entity, validating our business model based on quality of service to customers and specialisation.\n\nFinancial Information 2023\n\n#### *05.02\\_General Information*\n\nhers had reached 124,995.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis good evolution, which continues and confirms the progress recorded in recent years, allows us to maintain a positive projection toward the future. \"Our goal for 2024 is to continue on the path of profitable growth, maintaining high levels of return on equity (ROE) and solvency ratios that allow us to continue with a policy of satisfactory shareholder remuneration\", confirms the chairman of the company.\n\n#### **COMPARATIVE TABLE OF MAIN OPERATIONAL FIGURES**\n\n|                                                |  | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | %     | Thousands of euro |\n|------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------|-------|-------------------|\n| No. Customers Own Network                      |  | 124,995    | 118,542    | 5.4%  |                   |\n| Total assets (millions of euros)               |  | 30,852     | 26,370     | 17.0% |                   |\n| Stock exchange                                 |  | 14,100     | 12,170     | 15.9% |                   |\n| FIs and FCRs (own and third party)             |  | 7,403      | 6,354      | 16.5% |                   |\n| Pension Fund (*)                               |  | 3,909      | 3,367      | 16.1% |                   |\n| SICAVs and SCRs                                |  | 916        | 754        | 21.5% |                   |\n| Others                                         |  | 4,524      | 3,725      | 21.4% |                   |\n| Own network assets (millions of euros)         |  | 19,155     | 16,299     | 17.5% |                   |\n| Third-party network assets (millions of euros) |  | 11,697     | 10,071     | 16.1% |                   |\n\n## **COMPARATIVE TABLE OF COMMISSIONS AND NET PROFIT**\n\n|                                                | Thousands of euro |            |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|--------|\n|                                                | 31/12/2023        | 31/12/2022 | Δ%     |\n| Net commissions                                | 96,509            | 98,250     | -1.8%  |\n| Comm. received and exch. diff.                 | 172,879           | 181,169    | -4.6%  |\n| Commissions paid                               | -76,370           | -82,919    | -7.9%  |\n| Operating expenses                             | -94,280           | -82,785    | 13.9%  |\n| Financial margin                               | 23,194            | 9,094      | 155.0% |\n| Result of financial transactions and dividends | 10,997            | 3,066      | 258.7% |\n| Operating result                               | 36,365            | 29,382     | 23.8%  |\n| Net profit                                     | 26,563            | 21,782     | 21.9%  |\n\n#### **5. Materiality analysis**\n\nRenta 4 has carried out a materiality analysis in order to identify the most significant issues for the company and thus, define its strategic priorities to make progress in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility. This analysis has been carried out from both the internal and external points of view.\n\nFor the internal analysis, Renta 4 conducted interviews with the heads of the most relevant areas, and for the external analysis, the most relevant stakeholders for the bank were considered. The findings of this analysis are reflected in the following chart on Materiality:\n\n#### **MATERIALITY GRAPHIC**\n\nImage /page/137/Figure/11 description: This image is a scatter plot with the title \"MATERIACH PARA TINO\".

It should be noted that pollution is not a material impact from Renta 4's activity. Rather, gas emissions, light and noise pollution should be considered. Likewise, that is why it is not necessary to make provisions or guarantees on environmental risks, nor would it be necessary to take any action to avoid food waste.\n\nThis document presents information relating to Renta 4 at national and international level, including its head office, national branches and branches in Latin America. The data is presented in aggregate form and by buildings/offices, provided that such information is available and of interest.\n\nIn terms of environmental protection, Renta 4 carries out multiple actions in the areas it wishes to influence, in the course of its activity. These areas are:\n\n- **1.** Efficient energy consumption\n- **2.**Water use efficiency\n- **3.** Efficiency of paper and toner consumption\n- **4.** Environmental waste management / circular economy.\n- **5.** Reduction of GHG emissions (calculation of carbon footprint)\n\n## **1. Efficient energy consumption**\n\nTotal electricity consumption in 2022 was 1,912,795 kWh. In 2023, the total electricity consumption 2,087,372 kWh. This represents an increase in electricity consumption in 2023 of 9.13%.\n\n#### **Comparative Table of Electricity Consumption from 2021 to 2023**\n\n| Electricity consumption (kWh) | 2,023     | %      | 2022*     | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches                      | 1,082,017 | -4.64% | 1,134,618 | 1,122,744 | 1,173,680 |\n| Head office                   | 841,788   | 17.27% | 717,836   | 615,886   | 646,671   |\n| Total Spain                   | 1,923,805 | 3.85%  | 1,852,454 | 1,738,630 | 1,820,351 |\n| Total International**         | 163,567   | -      | 60,341    | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total Renta 4                 | 2,087,372 | 9.13%  | 1,912,795 | 1,798,971 | 1,842,534 |\n| Renta 4 workforce             | 670       | 5.85%  | 633       | 633       | 608       |\n| KWh/employee                  | 3,115     | 3.10%  | 3,022     | 2,839     | 3,030     |\n\n\\*\\* The international network includes in 2023 the electricity consumption of the Chilean office, the largest and with the highest number of employees in Latin America, compared to the rest of the offices that were already reported in 2022 and 2021. These data are described in more detail below.\n\n#### **Consumption in Spain**\n\nThe total energy consumption in Renta 4 increased by 9.13% with a total consumption of 2,087,372 kWh. If we analyse the ratio of kWh/employee, we can identify a slight but positive growth in energy consumption per employee. The data obtained during the financial year are analysed in detail below.\n\nIf we analyse only consumption in Spain, in 2022 the total electricity consumption of the network of offices nationwide and the headquarters of Paseo de la Habana, was 1,852,453 kWh<sup>1</sup> , while in 2023 this electricity consumption rose to 1,923,805 kWh, which represents an increase of 3.8% overall nationally. However, it should be noted that in branches consumption has been reduced by 4.6%.\n\nThe main reason for the 17% increase in electricity consumption at the headquarters is the renovation of the building located in Paseo de la Habana 63, whose consumption is attributed to the headquarters. This work began in May 2023 and is expected to be completed in spring 2024).\n\nAs a result of this assessment, the electricity consumption that was carried out in 2022 but that was billed in 2023 has been identified. This 2022 consumption has been included in the consumption data that were calculated in 2022 for adjustment.\n\nOther causes that could explain this increase in the headquarters are:\n\n· The growth of 3% of the average annual workforce in Spain;\n\n· the return to a routine of teleworking and reconciliation with the more normalised working life, which is still much higher than the prepandemic period, but which has been significantly reduced compared to 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn the network of offices, however, initiatives to raise awareness of employees and progressive improvement of the consumption efficiency of the facilities that are being renovated year after year, have achieved a reduction in consumption in 2023 of 4.6%, offsetting even events that increase energy use, such as:\n\n· The increase of 1.5% of the offices in Spain (a new office was opened in Madrid, General Peron);\n\n· the supply for the works and increase of 5 square meters of the 63 existing offices (duplicate counters during the works and larger areas for new facilities);\n\nThe measures mentioned, to optimise the energy consumption in the facilities, are detailed below.\n\nIn addition to these measures that are a great help in ensuring that the growth of the organisation does not translate into a high demand for energy **it should be noted that, since April, in Spain, all the electrical energy that has been consumed has been 100% renewable energy.** This measure has been implemented for all of Spain throughout 2023 and will be maintained going forward. This point is detailed in paragraph 4.5 on GHG emission reductions.\n\n<sup>1</sup>These data differ from what was reported in SNFI 2022 because in 2023 invoices relating to consumption adjustments of periods in 2022 arrived, and also in order to calculate the consumption figures included in the billing period in both years, to specifically consider the electricity consumption carried out in 2023.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **International Network Consumption**\n\nInternationally, a consumption of 60,342 kWh2 and a total of 163,567 kWh was reported in 2023. This data is not comparable to the figure of the previous year because in the 2023 report it was possible to add for the first time the electricity consumption of the office of Renta 4 Banco in Santiago de Chile (95,873 kWh). By adding this consumption, figures are now available for 100% of the electricity consumption in the international network of Renta 4, which in 2023 represented 7.83% of the total of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n| International network       | 2023 (kWh) | 2022 (kWh) |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Lima                        | 44,192     | 37,545     |\n| Santiago de Chile           | 95,873     | 0          |\n| Bogotá                      | 21,459     | 20,231     |\n| Luxembourg                  | 2,043      | 2,566      |\n| Total international network | 163,567    | 60,342     |\n\nFor comparison with the 2022 report, if we do not consider the consumption of the Santiago de Chile office, the total consumption of the international network grew by 11.2% in 2023.\n\nIn the international network there was no change in the number of offices during 2023, but there was a growth in staff that during the year grew by 8.86%, from 79 to 86 employees in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Therefore, the direct relationship between the increase in electricity consumption and the increase in the workforce, at the international level, is confirmed.\n\n#### **Measures to Optimise Energy Savings at Renta 4 Facilities**\n\nContinuing with the energy saving strategy applied in previous years both at the headquarters and in the new branches, existing lighting has been replaced with more energy efficient LED lighting, blinds have been installed and facility design has been modified to improve natural lighting and thermal comfort in the following branches:\n\n- · Headquarters at Paseo de la Habana, 74 in MADRID.\n- · Office space in Plaza de Santa Ana, 2 of AVILA.\n- · Office space in C/ miguel iscar, 5-7 of VALLADOLID.\n- · Office space in Rua Lepanto, 2 de VIGO.\n- · Office space in C/ Uria, 8 of OVIEDO.\n- · Office in C/ Jacinto, 2 of REAL CITY.\n- · Office space in Avda. Del General Peron, 26 de MADRID.\n\nIn order to reduce energy consumption, in 2023, the existing conventional air conditioning system was replaced by a variable refrigerant flow control system (VRF systems) in these same four offices.\n\nIn this way, the performance of the systems has been significantly optimised with consequent energy consumption that are believed to be between 25% and 30% lower than the previous centralised ON/OFF systems.\n\nDuring 2023 the energy improvement of the building of Paseo de la Habana, 63 in Madrid was studied, with the objective of obtaining an energy label with an A ranking. To do this, a project was drafted in two phases, that encompasses the integral action on the building itself and is based on the complete improvement of the covering, the design of facilities using the most efficient technology and the installation on the roof of photovoltaic panels for self-sufficiency, to produce a building that fulfils the defined sustainability and self-sufficiency standards. The completion of the works that will include all the actions defined in the project is scheduled for 2024.\n\n#### **2. Water use efficiency**\n\nIn its strategy for the intelligent management of natural resources, Renta 4 continues to implement the improvements established previously, in order to implement a strategy and concrete objectives in this aspect of care and commitment to the environment.\n\nIn connection with this commitment, the water consumption of its office network has been monitored, although it should be noted that the data obtained from water consumption still include a high percentage of them calculated on the basis of estimates (detailed below). The following data was obtained during the 2023 financial year:\n\n#### **Summary Table of Water Consumption (m3 )**\n\n| Branches      |  |\n|---------------|--|\n| Head office   |  |\n| International |  |\n| Total         |  |\n\n|               | 2023  | %      | 20223 | 2022  | 2021  |\n|---------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Branches      | 1,958 | 5.71%  | 1,852 | 1,587 | 1,437 |\n| Head office   | 2,694 | 11.40% | 2,418 | 2,418 | 1,749 |\n| International | 780   | -6.02% | 830   | 312   | 133   |\n| Total         | 5,431 | 6.50%  | 5,100 | 4,317 | 3,319 |\n\ncy Chile, Peru and Luxembourg\n\n· Branches with water included in the community 13\n\n· Branches without invoices for meter breakdowns 2\n\n· International with water included in the community Chile, Peru and Luxembourg\n\nThe total water consumption was measured by taking the meter readings indicated in the bills. In those cases where such readings were not available or when the counters do not provide a reliable reading for breakdowns, a consumption estimation model was used.\n\nThus, in 2023 there was an increase in the annual total water consumption of 5,431 m3, 6.5% more than in 2022 (5.100m3). This increase in consumption is explained considering the following aspects:\n\n· The renovation work of the building located in Paseo de la Habana 63 (water consumption of construction, started in May and is scheduled to be completed in spring 2024).\n\n· The growth of 3% of the average annual workforce in Spain (which grew from 554 to 571 between 2022 and 2023 respectively);\n\n· The increase of 1.5% of the offices in Spain (a new office was opened in Madrid, General Peron);\n\n· the supply of 5 of the 63 existing offices (8% of duplicate counters due to the construction of new facilities);\n\n· the return to a routine of teleworking against a more regular working life, which is still much higher than the pre-pandemic period, but which has been significantly reduced compared to 2021 and especially to 2022.\n\n<sup>3</sup>Revision of the calculation of water consumption compared to the 2022 SNFI. This review has been carried out using the same model for calculating the estimate of water consumption in offices that do not present data due to having damaged the meter or having the bill included in their community expenses. To do this, the average figure of m3 water per employee per year (8.1 m3/employee/year) x the number of employees in each office is used. In 2022 there were 11 offices in this situation in the Spanish Network and 3 offices in\n\nThis same model for estimating consumption in offices without readings was applied to 15 offices in Spain and 3 in Latin America in 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> The electricity consumption of the office of Renta 4 in Chile is not included since the consumption is included in the bill of community expenses in the SNFI 2022 nor could the consumption of Renta 4 in Peru be reported. However, this figure for the 2022 financial year has been corrected by adding this consumption.\n\nthe International Network.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Improvements in Water Consumption Efficiency**\n\nThese causes of increased water consumption have been partially offset by the measures installed to optimise water consumption. Improvements are progressively being implemented to optimise efficiency in the use of this resource, both at headquarters and throughout the office network, such as the installation of timed taps, automatic hydroalcoholic gel dispensers and double tank toilets. In 2023, these improvements have been applied to the following offices:\n\n- · Headquarters at Paseo de la Habana, 74 in MADRID.\n- · Office space in Plaza de Santa Ana, 2 of AVILA.\n- · Office space in C/ miguel iscar, 5-7 of VALLADOLID.\n- · Office space in Rua Lepanto, 2 de VIGO.\n- · Office space in C/ Uria, 8 of OVIEDO.\n- · Office in C/ Jacinto, 2 of REAL CITY.\n- · Office space in Avda. Del General Peron, 26 de MADRID.\n\n#### **Measurement and Monitoring of Consumption**\n\nAs in 2021 and 2022, a high level of collected information is maintained in 2023, but there are still a significant number of supply points that could not be included because the consumption of these is paid within the respective community bills.\n\nIn 2023, 13 branches were identified in Spain whose water consumption is included in community expenses. In 2022 this figure was 11 branches, to which has been added the new office of General Peron and the new office space of Avila.\n\nThe international network maintains the same situation as in 2022 and, for the moment, water consumption data is only obtained from the office in Colombia, while Chile, Peru and Luxembourg have the consumption included in their rental agreements.\n\nIn addition, in the monitoring of consumption it is necessary to consider other types of incidents such as breakdowns of water meters. This affects the current year's billing and, in its regularisation, probably the subsequent year's billing. In 2023 two offices were identified with meter failures (Toledo and Albacete).\n\n#### **3. Paper and toner consumption efficiency**\n\nThe decision to digitise the office a few years ago was one of the most important measures that have been established in Renta 4 to reduce the consumption ratios of ink and paper. This is an effect that seeks a direct impact on the environment.\n\nAfter the abnormal effects caused by the confinement and the pandemic, since 2022 teleworking has been normalised within the company's activity, increasing consumption of paper and toner compared to that period. Therefore, the comparison between 2022 and 2023 is more useful to analyse.\n\n#### **3.1. Paper consumption**\n\n#### *Consumption in Spain*\n\nWith regard to paper consumption in Spain, the consumption of paper was reduced considerably in 2023, reducing by 45.7% in the headquarters and 32.5% in the office network. In absolute terms it represents a reduction in total paper consumption in Spain from 1,891,723 sheets in 2022 to 1,173,091 sheets in 2023.\n\nThis reduction is the result of several actions carried out throughout the financial year, such as:\n\n· Awareness-raising campaign: Internal communiqués, intranet posts and posters were displayed at printer points, with awareness-raising messages to reduce paper consumption and encourage the use of black toner instead of colour.\n\n· Campaign messages aimed at promoting the different impact factors:\n\n- Print in black and white: \"Nature prefers it in black and white\"\n\n- Using the cloud instead of printing documents: \"To print or not to print, that is the question\"\n\n- Use of double-sided printing (Duplex): \"Batman is not the only one who has two faces\"\n\n· Configuring the printers in Duplex mode: Since August 2023, all printers in the office network and headquarters have been configured with the default Duplex mode functionality, so that double-sided sheets of paper are printed, unless users specify otherwise each time they print.\n\n· This represents a direct saving in this resource in 2023 of 152,876 sheets of paper in the headquarters and 472,317 sheets in the office network, a total saving of paper of 625,193 sheets4. Paper savings represented 34.8% of total theoretical consumption (paper consumed + paper saved).\n\n| Paper consumption at headquarters | 2022    | 2023    | %      |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Printed pages                     | N/A     | 569,312 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode              | N/A     | 290,512 | -      |\n| Total paper consumption (pages)   | 781492  | 424,056 | -45.7% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*            | N/A     | 152,876 | -      |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)             | 3,907.5 | 2,120.3 | -45.7% |\n\n| Paper consumption in the office network | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Printed pages                           | N/A       | 1,216,507 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode                    | N/A       | 934,944   | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 1,110,231 | 749,035   | -32.5% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*                  | N/A       | 472,317   | -      |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)                   | 5,551.2   | 3,745.2   | -32.5% |\n\n| Total paper consumption in Spain | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Total paper consumption (pages)  | 1,891,723 | 1,173,091 | -38.0% |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)            | 9,458.6   | 5,865.5   | -38.0% |\n| Sheets of paper saved*           | N/A       | 625,193   | -      |\n\n4 This amount does not represent the subtraction between prints and duplex because when the pages to be printed are odd, there is a page that does not affect the duplex mode. This number is therefore obtained directly by the information offered directly by the control panels of the printers, considering what they display\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *International Network*\n\nHowever, in the international network consumption shows a significant increase, but this is because in 2022 no figures were obtained from Chile or Luxembourg. In 2023, consumption figures were available from Chile, the largest office in the international network, which represented a total of 165,488 printed pages, 669.4%. If Peru and Colombia are considered exclusively for comparison with 2022, the increase represented 6.2%, mainly justified by the increase in staff in these offices.\n\n| International paper consumption (pages) | 2022   | 2023    | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Paper consumption in Chile              | N/A    | 142,653 | -      |\n| Paper consumption in Peru               | 15,994 | 16,707  | 4.5%   |\n| Paper consumption in Colombia           | 5,516  | 6,128   | 11.1%  |\n| Paper consumption in Luxembourg         | N/A    | N/A     | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 21,510 | 165,488 | 669.4% |\n\nIn the absence of Luxembourg, which represents a negligible volume of printed pages per year compared to the total, sufficient metrics are now available for the adequate monitoring of this indicator.\n\n#### *Renta 4 Total Consumption*\n\n| Renta 4 total paper consumption (pages) | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Printed pages                           | N/A       | 1,785,819 | -      |\n| Pages in Duplex mode                    | N/A       | 1,225,456 | -      |\n| Total paper consumption                 | 1,913,233 | 1,338,579 | -30.0% |\n| Kg of paper (5g/unit)                   | 9,566.2   | 6,692.9   | -30.0% |\n\nIf we consider figures related to the number of sheets consumed per employee, the number was reduced from 3,022.5 in 2022 to 1,998 in 2023, a 33.9% decrease. A very positive trend, as a result of the actions carried out during the year.\n\n| Paper consumption per employee  | 2022      | 2023      | %      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Number of employees             | 633       | 670       | 5.8%   |\n| Total paper consumption (pages) | 1,913,233 | 1,338,579 | -30.0% |\n| Paper consumption / employee    | 3,022.5   | 1,997.9   | -33.9% |\n\n#### **3.2. Toner consumption**\n\nThe measurement of toner consumption in 2023 is an unrepresentative measure given that throughout the year all printers have been replaced in the facilities of Spain. At headquarters, 17 devices have been replaced, while 141 devices have been replaced in the office network. When replacing one device with another, it has not been possible to reuse the toner cartridges regardless of how used they were. In any case, the estimate has been made by taking the replacement data that have been identified in the devices in the periods that they were operating (both old and new) and adding 17 and 141 respectively for the headquarters and the network.\n\nConsidering this situation, in 2023 a total of 441 toner cartridges were replaced between B&N (Black and White) and Colour in Spain, 40.9% more than in the previous year. This figure, added to the 32 toner replacements in Latin America, adds a total of 473 toner cartridges.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that the data of the international network also has aspects that complicate the comparison, but that in order to have a figure with which to be able to maintain the annual monitoring, we consider it important to make the calculation. The aspects that influence the calculation for the international network are\n\n· as described in the previous section, the fact that this year the values of printed pages are available in Chile and that these represent an increase of more than 100%\n\n· compared to the previous calculation system counting the cartridges that were purchased, regardless of whether they were used or put into stock. This indicator was unreliable so it has been decided to take the volume of pages per toner of the network of offices in Spain, to make an estimate.\n\n| Toner units           | 2021 | 2022 | 2023* | 2023 | %     |\n|-----------------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|\n| Headquarters          | 44   | 49   | 36    | 53   | 8.2%  |\n| Office network        | 223  | 264  | 247   | 388  | 47.0% |\n| Total Spain           | 267  | 313  | 283   | 441  | 40.9% |\n| International network | 26   | 17   | 32    | 32   | 88.2% |\n| Total Renta 4         | 293  | 330  | 315   | 473  | 43.3% |\n\n\\*For information purposes, 2023 consumption has also been indicated considering only the replacements identified in the devices.\n\nIf we analyse the data based on toner consumption per employee, logically, we see the same growth effect going from 0.521 cartridges per employee in 2022 to 0.706 in 2023, 35.4% more.\n\n#### **Toner units per Employee**\n\n|                         | 2021  | 2022  | 2023* | 2023  | %     |\n|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Toner units             | 293   | 330   | 315   | 473   | 43.3% |\n| Employees               | 595   | 633   | 670   | 670   | 5.8%  |\n| Toner unit per employee | 0.492 | 0.521 | 0.470 | 0.706 | 35.4% |\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/22 description: The image contains the number 143 in white font on a green background.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4. Environmental waste management / circular economy**\n\nRenta 4 remains committed to \"reducing\" the amount of waste generated, \"reusing\" existing products as much as possible and \"recycling\" those that are no longer useful.\n\nFinally, we continue to use certified materials that ensure that their procurement, manufacture and recycling are subject to a series of environmental requirements, seeking to reduce the carbon footprint they generate and valuing environmentally friendly and social aspects in the use of the products and services contracted.\n\nTo give some examples, the purchase of paper for the printers is certified with the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) seal, which guarantees responsible forest management; and Ecolabel, regulated by Regulation 66/2010 of the European Union that allows us to know if a product or service has been produced under the policy of sustainable production and consumption, reducing the negative impact on production and consumption on the environment, health, the climate and natural resources. This together with the collection and recycling of the paper and cardboard that is consumed in the entity.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/6 description: The image shows the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo. The logo is a green square with a white tree symbol at the top, followed by the letters \"FSC\" in a bold font. Below the letters, the website address \"www.fsc.org\" is printed in a smaller font.\n\nLa marca de la gestión\nforestal responsable\nFSC® C166432\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/8 description: The image shows the EU Ecolabel logo. The logo features a stylized flower with the Euro symbol (€) at its center, surrounded by a circle of stars. Below the flower, the text \"EU Ecolabel\" is written in a sans-serif font. Underneath \"Ecolabel\", the website address \"www.ecolabel.eu\" is displayed in a smaller font size. The logo is set against a textured, off-white background.\n\nLikewise, water bottles for individual consumption, which are consumed by customers and at meetings, must always be identified with the 100% recyclable product seal.\n\nIn this regard, Renta4 continues to reuse most of the existing furniture, while the furniture that is no longer useful for the required purposes is donated to non-profit associations.\n\n#### **Computer Waste**\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Renta 4 has continued its commitment to secure IT waste management and destruction, following all the necessary procedures to ensure optimum security in the process. This avoids any kind of security breach with regard to the Group's information.\n\nFor this destruction, Renta 4 always relies on certified professionals in the sector to ensure the correct destruction of computer waste. In addition, the internal technical staff is always responsible for sending this waste for destruction once it has undergone a prior process of analysis, resetting and pre-destruction, thus ensuring that the waste is rendered unusable.\n\nDuring 2023, Renta4 did not have to make use of the service of destruction of computer waste, and in the last quarter of 2023 we decided to add ValoraData as an alternative provider to the current provider. During the first months of 2024, a massive destruction will be carried out due to the updating of 210 computer devices in the workplace, carried out at the end of the year.\n\n#### **5. GHG emission reduction**\n\nA very important step toward reducing GHG emissions was taken in early 2022. Renta 4 has established a methodology for calculating the carbon footprint in accordance with the GHG Protocol, for the calculation of scopes 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the definition established therein.\n\nThis model has been tested with the calculation of the carbon footprint for 2021 and, as MITECO data is updated, the footprint for 2022 will be recalculated. The results were added to the sustainability report published in mid-2022.\n\nThis detailed calculation of the carbon footprint will be carried out and reported on an annual basis in order to be able to diligently comply with the decarbonisation SDG established by the entity.\n\n## **Result of the Carbon Footprint for 2023**\n\nThe result of the calculation of the operational emissions carbon footprint calculated for 2023 was 1,024.95 of tCO2eq, 2.50% more than in 2022 (999.91 tCO2eq), relating to the total of Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 operational emissions. As for the financial carbon footprint, it has been reduced by 41, 90%, going from 211,480 tCO2eq to 122,862 tCO2eq.\n\nIn total, the carbon footprint in 2023 was 123,887 tCO2eq, 41.69% less than in 2022.\n\nAlthough this result is very positive, it is important to analyse the causes of the reduction obtained, understanding that the CO2 emissions relating to Scope 3 by financial activity represent 99% of the total emissions and their reduction in 2023 relates to the effect of the context.\n\nThe following sections detail all the calculations made for each of the scopes of the carbon footprint in 2023.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that this year there have been significant corrections to the emissions reported in the previous year's report due to changes in the calculation methodology, adjustments of emissions received in 2023 that related to the 2022 period and greater detail of information available.\n\n| Operational GHG emissions        | Emissions (t CO₂ eq)<br>2022 | Emissions (t CO₂ eq)<br>2023 | Change Emissions<br>'22-'23 (%) |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Scope 1                          | 87.02                        | 98.49                        | 13.19%                          |\n| Scope 2                          | 109.76                       | 72.05                        | -34.36%                         |\n| Branches                         | 85.11                        | 28.04                        | -67.05%                         |\n| Head office                      | 13.85                        | 3.95                         | -71.48%                         |\n| Total Spain                      | 98.95                        | 32                           | -67.66%                         |\n| International*                   | 10.81                        | 40.06                        |                                 |\n| Scope 3 operational              | 803.13                       | 854.40                       | 6.38%                           |\n| 1.

Emissions by scope 1 – by direct emissions**\n\nIf we consider the sources of CO2 produced by the direct consumption of fuels by Renta 4, we must evaluate three sources:\n\nAs in previous years, the first source to consider is that of the diesel generator at the headquarters. This generator is activated in case of power outage. In 2023, the generator has been disposed of for a total of 6.5h, which has involved a consumption of 147.25 l of fuel with its GHG emission effect of 0.37 t CO2 eq.\n\n|               | Consumption per<br>% of load | Consumption per<br>hour according to<br>load (l/h) | Hours of<br>consumption | Consumption (l) | Emissions<br>(t CO₂ eq) |\n|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| At 50% charge |                              | 23.10                                              | 5.50                    | 134.75          | 0.34                    |\n| At 25% charge |                              | 12.50                                              | 1                       | 12.50           | 0.03                    |\n| Total         |                              |                                                    | 6.50                    | 147.25          | 0.37                    |\n\nPAlso, another source to consider is the corporate fleet. In this regard, the company does not have its own vehicles and therefore does not represent a generation of tCO2eq.\n\nFinally, scope 1 should consider the consumption of fluorinated gases in air conditioning systems. In 2023, in the renovations of offices, more air conditioning systems have been replaced by more efficient systems, specifically 8 units have been renovated, 2 air conditioning units more than in 2022, hence the increase in fluorinated gases in the period.

Scope 2 emissions – by indirect emissions (energy)**\n\nIn 2023, the total electricity consumption of the entire office network including the Paseo de la Habana headquarters at national level was 1,923,805 kWh (as indicated in section 3.1), of which 93.9% (1,805,661 kWh) came from renewable energy sources, while in 2022 these only represented 80.2% of the total. In this context, a total of 32 tCO2eq were emitted in Spain in 2023, 67.7% less than in 2022.\n\n| Electrical energy (kWh) | 2,023     | %       | 2022*     | %       | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches                | 1,082,017 | -4.64%  | 1,134,618 | -3.33%  | 1,122,744 | 1,173,680 |\n| Head office             | 841,788   | 17.27%  | 717,836   | 11.01%  | 615,886   | 646,671   |\n| Total Spain             | 1,923,805 | 3.85%   | 1,852,454 | 1.76%   | 1,738,630 | 1,820,351 |\n| International           | 163,568   | 171.07% | 60,341    | 172.02% | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total                   | 2,087,372 | 9.13%   | 1,912,795 | 3.81%   | 1,798,971 | 1,842,534 |\n\n#### **Distribution according to the origin of electrical energy (kWh)**\n\n| Renewable kWh     | 2,023     | % of total | 2022*     | % of total | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Branches          | 978,404   | 90.42%     | 820,684   | 72.37%     | 834,785   | 131,172   |\n| Head office       | 827,257   | 98.27%     | 666,933   | 92.91%     | 564,984   | 599,867   |\n| Total Spain       | 1,805,661 | 93.86%     | 1,487,617 | 82.85%     | 1,399,769 | 731,039   |\n| International     | 2,043     | 1.25%      | 0         | 0.00%      | 0         | 0         |\n| Total             | 1,807,704 | 86.60%     | 1,487,617 | 77.77%     | 1,399,769 | 731,039   |\n| NON-renewable kWh | 2,023     | % of total | 2022*     | % of total | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n| Branches          | 103,613   | 9.58%      | 313,394   | 27.63%     | 287,959   | 1,042,507 |\n| Head office       | 14,531    | 1.73%      | 50,902    | 7.09%      | 50,902    | 46,805    |\n| Total Spain       | 118,144   | 6.14%      | 313,861   | 17.42%     | 338,861   | 1,089,312 |\n| International     | 161,524   | 98.75%     | 60,341    | 100.00%    | 60,341    | 22,183    |\n| Total             | 279,668   | 13.40%     | 425,178   | 22.23%     | 399,202   | 1,111,495 |\n| tCO2 emitted      | 2,023     | %          | 2022*     | %          | 2,022     | 2,021     |\n| Branches          | 28.04     | -67.05%    | 85.11     | 51.57%     | 56.15     | 204.90    |\n| Head office       | 3.95      | -71.46%    | 13.84     | 39.43%     | 9.93      | 12.08     |\n| Total Spain       | 31.99     | -67.67%    | 98.95     | -54.50%    | 66.08     | 216.98    |\n| International     | 40.06     | 270.72%    | 10.81     | -8.20%     | 11.77     | 5.04      |\n| Total             | 72.05     | -34.35%    | 109.76    | 40.99%     | 77.85     | 222.02    |\n\nIn the international network, Luxembourg has also transferred its contracts to renewable energy sources, so in 2023 the emissions of CO2 for this international headquarters was 0 tCO2eq.\n\nThere have been no changes in the Latin American network in this regard. The 2023 electricity consumption of 161,524 kWh resulted in an emission of 40.06 tCO2eq, an increase compared to the 10.81 tCO2eq reported in 2022, due to the fact that the electricity consumption of the Chilean office could not be measured in 2022. If we did not take this into account, emissions would be 11.23 tCO2eq, 3.7% more than the previous year.\n\nConsidering the total consumption of electricity of Renta 4 in 2023 (2,087,372 kWh), consumption from renewable energy sources (1,807,704 kWh) represents 86.60% of the total consumed, and the CO2 emissions in the year were 72.05 tCO2eq, a decrease of 34.35% compared to 2022.\n\n#### *\\*Corrections of the 2022 Measurement Model*\n\nThe differences detected in the calculation used in 2022 are due to the fact that the figure used in the 2022 report was based on an approximation model that did not yet use the carbon footprint calculation model developed and applied for the sustainability report submitted in may 2023. This calculation is carried out in accordance with GHG Protocol and MITECO instructions. In addition, with regard to the consumption figures for 2023, an assessment was carried out to specifically consider the electricity consumption carried out in 2023. As a result of this assessment, the electricity consumption that was carried out in 2022 but that was billed in 2023 has been identified. This 2022 consumption has been included in the consumption data that were calculated in 2022 for adjustment. In\n\nuarters at national level was 1,923,805 kWh (as indicated\nrepresented 80.2% of the total. In this context, a total of\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\naddition, the emission factors for Luxembourg, Colombia, Chile and Peru obtained from their respective official sources have been adjusted.\n\n## *Towards a 100% Sustainable Energy Consumption, With 0% Ghg Emissions*\n\nAs indicated in the plan that was included in the 2022 Report, in early 2023 the company ALPE ENERGY was hired to avoid these possible changes in the electricity generation policy of the suppliers and to be able to guarantee an agile and immediate reaction in the renegotiation. A necessary partnership to achieve the goal of 100% sustainable energy consumption. This objective is part of the SDG established for decarbonisation of the entity by operational activity in 2025 and aligned with the accession to NZBA.\n\nTwo important milestones in this process were achieved in 2023:\n\n**The first milestone achieved is that, since April 2023, 100% of the energy consumed by all the activity of Renta 4 in Spain (headquarters and office network) has been of sustainable origin. That is, we emit 0 Tn of CO2.** \n\nSimilarly, the Luxembourg office has also achieved 0 emissions since January.\n\nThis positive effect on renewable energy consumption in Spain and Luxembourg is very significant since the effort to neutralise CO2 emissions is not the result of offsetting, but by directly not generating emissions.\n\nTo achieve this milestone, we must add that, at the beginning of the year, certain energy distribution companies switched their generation to a mix combined with other energy sources. Renta 4 reacted immediately and, together with ALPE ENERGY, contracts were renegotiated to recover electricity generation from renewable energy sources as soon as possible.\n\nWith regard to emissions generated by Scope 2 throughout the year, GHG neutrality has been achieved in the national territory and Luxembourg. The objective is to focus now on Latin America to achieve the same results as soon as possible.\n\n#### **5.3. Scope 3 emissions – by indirect emissions (rest)**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group calculates the scope 3 of the carbon footprint according to the GHG Protocol.\n\nIn this scope, the following sources of emissions should be considered:\n\n· Indirect operational emissions generated by\n\n- services provided by suppliers,\n\n- commuting of employees to work places,\n\n- and business travel;\n\n· Indirect financed emissions, which in turn are also classified into\n\n- direct\n\n- indirect.\n\n#### *a. Indirect Operational Emissions*\n\nIndirect operational emissions increased by 6.38% from 803.13 tCO2eq in 2022 to 854.32 tCO2eq in 2023. Employee mobility has not changed significantly, growing by only 9.07%. The largest variations were the growth in business travel emissions (+74.23%), and the fall in emissions from contracting goods and services to suppliers (-34.14%).\n\n| Indirect operational emissions (tCO₂eq) | 2022   | 2023   | Var (%) | % of total |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|------------|\n| 1. Emissions from service providers     | 303.27 | 199.74 | -34.14% | 23.38%     |\n| 2. Employee mobility emissions          | 331.87 | 361.98 | 9.07%   | 42.37%     |\n| 3. Business travel emissions            | 167.99 | 292.68 | 74.23%  | 34.26%     |\n| Total                                   | 803.13 | 854.32 | 6.38%   |            |\n\nBelow, we will describe in detail each of the categories of operational indirect emissions to better understand the causes of their variation, as well as the calculation methods and estimates applied for each case.\n\n#### 1. Indirect Operational Emissions from Service Providers\n\nThe footprint for the acquisition of goods and services decreased between 2022 and 2023 both in absolute terms (- 34%) and in relative terms compared to each million euro of expenditure in the year for supplies of goods and services (- 32%). In 2022, total emissions from purchases of goods and services amounted to 303.27 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, while in 2023 they amounted to 199.74 tons of CO2 eq.\n\nEmissions related to supply expenditure decreased from 3.72 tons per million euro expenditure in 2022 to 2.52 tons per million euro expenditure in 2023.\n\nIt should be noted that the figures indicated for emissions and invoicing of 2022 suppliers were adjusted in 2024, so they are different from those indicated in the Sustainability Report published in May 2023 (compared to 2022 data). This adjustment has consisted in eliminating from the total invoicing of suppliers directed to Renta 4 those invoices that included items not related to the acquisition of goods and services (in particular, invoices related to commissions not related to the development of the Renta 4 activity). This approach will be maintained in the future.\n\n#### **Scope 3 – Operational Indirect Emissions by Suppliers, Classified by Sector**\n\n| Sector                                                             | Suppliers | (t CO₂eq) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 2         | 31.35     |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 2         | 34.62     |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 2         | 1.42      |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 1         | 4.32      |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24        | 20.89     |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 49        | 78.22     |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 3         | 8.75      |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 10        | 12.89     |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 5         | 6.42      |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1         | 0.84      |\n| Total                                                              | 99        | 199.74    |\n\n| Sector                                                             | Suppliers | (t CO₂ |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 2         | 31.3   |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 2         | 34.6   |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 2         | 1.4    |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 1         | 4.3    |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24        | 20.8   |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 49        | 78.2   |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 3         | 8.7    |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 10        | 12.8   |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 5         | 6.4    |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1         | 0.8    |\n| Total                                                              | 99        | 199.   |\n\nThe decrease in relative emissions from year to year is mainly due to:\n\n· A decrease in the number of suppliers analysed in manufacturing (2 in 2023 compared to 3 in 2022), with manufacturing being a highly polluting sector (more polluting than all sectors included in the calculation). While turnover in this sector has decreased by 47% due to a 33% reduction in the number of suppliers, absolute emissions in this sector have been reduced by 60%.\n\n· A decrease of 56% in absolute emissions in the construction sector, although there has been no decrease in the number of suppliers analysed (2) and the reduction in their turnover has been only 4%. This significant reduction in emissions from the construction sector is due to an improvement in data quality. All emissions for this sector have been calculated on the basis of sectoral data, information provided by the Eurostat database. Also, in line with the latest data update, emissions from the construction sector have been reduced by 44%.\n\n· Decrease of 48% of the absolute emissions of the sector of professional, scientific and technical activities considering that the reduction in the number of suppliers in this sector is equivalent to 38% and that the reduction in their turnover has been 37%.\n\n· Unlike 2022, no provider from the education sector has been included in the analysis, so emissions for this sector have been completely eliminated.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Scope 3 – Services and Acquired Goods | Absolute and Relative Emissions by Sector and Variation Compared to the Previous Year**\n\n|                                                                    | 2022                        | 2023   | '22vs'23      | 2022                                            | 2023   | '22vs23       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|\n| Sector                                                             | Absolute emissions (tCO2eq) |        | Variation (%) | Relative emissions<br>(kg CO2 eq / thousands €) |        | Variation (%) |\n| C – Manufacturing industry                                         | 78.25                       | 31.35  | -59.93%       | 150.62                                          | 113.44 | -24.69%       |\n| F – Construction                                                   | 79.43                       | 34.62  | -56.41%       | 20.86                                           | 9.49   | -54.50%       |\n| G – Wholesale and retail trade; repair of vehicles and motorcycles | 1.53                        | 1.42   | -7.50%        | 2.86                                            | 2.77   | -3.18%        |\n| H – Transport and storage                                          | 4.37                        | 4.32   | -1.06%        | 20.94                                           | 21.57  | 3.00%         |\n| J – Information and communications                                 | 24.36                       | 20.89  | -14.24%       | 3.56                                            | 2.50   | -29.72%       |\n| K – Financial and insurance activities                             | 68.6                        | 78.22  | 14.03%        | 1.1                                             | 1.28   | 16.60%        |\n| L – Real estate activities                                         | 2.1                         | 8.75   | 317.77%       | 9.71                                            | 13.02  | 34.13%        |\n| M – Professional, scientific and technical activities              | 24.73                       | 12.89  | -47.88%       | 4.39                                            | 3.63   | -17.30%       |\n| N – Administrative activities and auxiliary services               | 6.71                        | 6.42   | -4.41%        | 6.48                                            | 6.71   | 7.73%         |\n| P – Education                                                      | 11.55                       | -      | -             | 90.28                                           | -      | -             |\n| R – Artistic, recreational and entertainment activities            | 1.63                        | 0.84   | -48.51%       | 11.34                                           | 2.95   | -73.97%       |\n| Total                                                              | 303.27                      | 199.74 | -34.14%       | 3.72                                            | 2.52   | -32.26%       |\n\n#### *Calculation Method*\n\nGiven the still novel nature of these indicators, we consider it appropriate to describe the calculation method applied.\n\nFor indirect Scope 3 emissions, which result from services provided by suppliers, Renta 4 allocated a portion of the emissions of each supplier in proportion to the service received, out of the total services provided by the emitting company.\n\n· Therefore, the Scope 3 emissions related to the Renta 4 suppliers have been calculated using the information on the Scope Footprint 1 and 2 provided by the suppliers themselves or, failing that, estimated according to an average of emissions and billing by CNAE, following the hybrid method dictated by the GHG Protocol.\n\n· The sources of the average emissions and turnover by CNAE have been obtained from Eurostat, Bank of Spain, Sabi and Osiris.\n\nThroughout 2023 Renta 4 worked with more than 2,300 suppliers. For the calculation of the carbon footprint of this year, the same criterion applied in 2022 has been used to select those suppliers that impacted the most on the company's profit and loss account, thus choosing those suppliers that invoiced Renta 4 more than €100,000 in 2023.\n\nFollowing the choice of this criterion, a total of 99 suppliers (compared to 98 in 2022) representing 86% of total expenditure on Renta 4 supplies in 2023 (compared to 75% covered in 2022) were analysed.\n\nOf these 99 suppliers, the multiplier was calculated for 53 of them on the basis of actual 2022 or earlier carbon footprint and turnover data published for 2023, 2022 or earlier based on data availability, while for the remaining 46, the carbon footprint by turnover was estimated according to the sector average.\n\nIt can be observed that the methodology is more accurate in relation to the total estimated emissions, in particular 43% of the emissions have been estimated based on the information of carbon footprint and billing of suppliers (compared to 27% in 2022). This difference is due to the availability of data when searching for information.\n\n## *2. Indirect Operational Emissions of Employee Mobility*\n\nThe carbon footprint due to the mobility of employees increased between 2022 and 2023 by 9.07%, from 331.88 to 361.98 tons of CO2 equivalent. In addition, regarding the tons of CO2 eq emitted by each employee, these increased from 0.524 in 2022 to 0.538 in 2023 (2.63%).\n\n|                                 | Adjusted results with estimates | 2022   | 2023   | Var (%) |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Emissions (t CO₂ eq)            |                                 | 331.88 | 361.98 | 9.07%   |\n| Emissions (t CO₂ eq / employee) |                                 | 0.524  | 0.538  | 3.05%   |\n\nThis difference is due in absolute terms to the increase in the total number of employees from 633 in 2022 to 670 in 2023, and in relative terms with respect to each employee to the fact that the main means of transport used by the employees is their own vehicle, where:\n\n· In general and within the category \"own vehicle\" the car is the medium that produces the most emissions as a whole (91% of the total emissions and 88% of the distance travelled by this category).\n\n· In 2023, gasoline-powered vehicles accounted for a higher percentage of the kilometres travelled by all own vehicles, 40.12%, compared to 36.57% in 2022, representing an increase of 9.71%. In addition, the emission factor for gasoline fuel cars (0.196 kg CO2/km) is higher than for diesel fuel (0.165 kg CO2/km).\n\nIn addition, the carbon footprint in relative terms with respect to each kilometre of travel made by employees on journeys from home to workplaces increased only by 10.62%, from 0.197 kilograms of CO2 eq/km to 0.218 kilograms of CO2 eq/km.\n\n| Carbon footprint per km travelled    | 2022  | 2023  | Var (%) |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Emissions (kg CO2 eq / km travelled) | 0.197 | 0.218 | 10.62%  |\n\n· This difference in emissions per kilometre of travel is due to the fact that employee travel patterns changed slightly between 2022 and 2023. Most employees continue to travel by car, which is the most polluting means of transport. The main difference between the two years is that in 2023 the proportion of kilometres taken by bus increased (from 6.90% to 9.35%), while the proportion of kilometres taken on foot or by bicycle (the least polluting means of transport) decreased (from 6.12% to 5.68%).\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Results of the Mobility Survey and its Corresponding Carbon Footprint*\n\nGross results of the survey, that is, exclusively on those answers considered valid, without applying the estimates for the entire organisation.\n\n| Means of transport          | Distance travelled |        | Emission factor (kg CO₂eq/km) | Emissions |        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n|                             | km                 | %      |                               | tCO₂eq    | %      |\n| Walking, bicycle or scooter | 80,200             | 5.68%  | -                             | 0         | 0%     |\n| Metro/train                 | 288,474            | 20.43% | 0.03*                         | 18.36     | 5.96%  |\n| Bus                         | 131,986            | 9.35%  | 0.05*                         | 19.02     | 6.18%  |\n| Own vehicle                 | 911,055            | 64.54% | Variable                      | 270.57    | 87.86% |\n| Car                         | 797,427            | 56.49% |                               | 245.29    | 79.65% |\n| Motorcycle                  | 113,628            | 8.05%  |                               | 25.28     | 8.21%  |\n| Total                       | 1,411,716          | 100%   | -                             | 307.95    | 100%   |\n| *Figures for Spain          |                    |        |                               |           |        |\n\n#### *Results of the Mobility Survey According to use of Means of Transport*\n\n· The means of transport most chosen by Renta 4 workers, specifically by 56% (317 of the workers surveyed), is their own vehicle.\n\n· 4% (23 workers) of those who choose this option, in addition to the private vehicle, use public transport.\n\n· 11% of workers (37 workers) who come to their jobs in private vehicles share a vehicle with one or more people.\n\n· 19% are exclusively on foot or by bicycle (106 of the employees surveyed).\n\n· The least chosen transportation is the bus, by 12% of the workers (69 of the employees surveyed).\n\n|                             | % employees per transport means out of total employees |        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Means of transport          | 2022                                                   | 2023   |\n| Walking, bicycle or scooter | 35.52%                                                 | 41.75% |\n| Metro/train                 | 17.16%                                                 | 20.18% |\n| Bus                         | 10.30%                                                 | 12.11% |\n| Car                         | 36.72%                                                 | 42.98% |\n| Motorcycle                  | 35.52%                                                 | 12.63% |\n\n#### Calculation Method\n\nGiven the still novel nature of these indicators, we consider it appropriate to describe the calculation method applied.\n\nFor the commuting from home to workplace of employees of Renta 4, whose offices are located in Spain, the average emission factors for each type of vehicle considered per kilometre travelled, published by MITECO and IDAE were used (Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving). For Chile, Colombia, Peru and Luxembourg, emission factors published by the relevant ministries of each country were used, provided that available and reliable emission factors could be found. Alternatively, for cases where information was not available, the same factors as Spain or those published by the Government of the United Kingdom were used in their absence.\n\nA total of 570 valid responses and 55 invalid questionnaire responses were received from a total of 670 employees who were part of the company at the end of 2023. For the 47 employees who did not respond or whose answers were not validated (55), their activity data and associated emissions have been estimated using the average consumption of the valid answers. It should be noted that the percentage of employee participation in the survey increased significantly from 2022 to 2023, 63.2% to 92.9%\n\n#### *3. Indirect Operational Emissions from Business Travel*\n\nIn 2023 business travel emissions increased by 74.23% from 167.99 tCO2eq in 2022 to 292.68 tCO2 eq in 2023.\n\n| Means of transport (tCO2eq) | 2022   | 2023   | Variation '22-'23 (%) |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Air travel                  | 164.05 | 288.99 | 76.17%                |\n| Train                       | 3.94   | 3.59   | -8.64%                |\n| Taxi                        |        | 0.002  | -                     |\n| Bus                         |        | 0.082  | -                     |\n| Total                       | 167.99 | 292.68 | 74.23%                |\n\nThis is mainly due to:\n\n· An 8% increase in the number of trips made compared to 2022 (749 trips in 2023, compared with 693 trips in 2022).\n\n· Above all, however, there was a 14% increase in the number of air travel compared to 2022 (400 trips in 2023, compared with 351 trips in 2022). Air travel accounts for 87.64% of the kilometres travelled and 98.74% of total emissions. This is therefore the main emission factor in the category of business travel.\n\n· And there is a corresponding increase of 17% in the number of kilometres travelled compared to 2022 (826,304 km in 2023, compared to 705,474 km in 2022).\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is interesting to note that the emissions relating to train travel have reduced by 9% since fewer trips have been made and fewer kilometres travelled in this means of transport (reduction of 9%, from 110,981 km in 2022 to 101,465 km in 2023).\n\n| Means of<br>transport | Distance (km) | Emission factor<br>(kg CO₂eq/km) | Emissions<br>(t CO₂eq) | Distance (%) | Emissions (%) |\n|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Train                 | 101,465       | 0.035                            | 3.6                    | 12.28%       | 1.23%         |\n| Air travel            | 724,133       | Variable                         | 289                    | 87.64%       | 98.74%        |\n| Bus                   | 690           | 0.118                            | 0.08                   | 0.08%        | 0.03%         |\n| Taxi                  | 15.80         | 0.149                            | 0                      | 0.00%        | 0.00%         |\n| Total                 | 826,303       | -                                | 292.68                 | 100%         | 100%          |\n\n# Calculation Method\n\nBusiness trips relate to journeys made by workers for work reasons (meetings, office visits, etc.) either by plane, train, bus or taxi. It should be noted that these last two means of transport (bus and taxi) have been included in the calculation of the carbon footprint of Scope 3 with regard to business trips in 2023, although they were not included in the calculation of 2022 due to the unavailability of data. With regard to these means of transport, both the distance travelled and the emissions of CO2 are negligible.\n\nEmission factors published by the British Government in June 2023 have been used for the calculations of emissions from business travel.\n\nThe activity data have been collected from the distances travelled in the aforementioned means of transport for the year 2023 thanks to the information provided by the travel agency that Renta 4 uses (Agencias de Viajes Marine S.L.).\n\n# *b. Financed Indirect Emissions*\n\nAs for the Scope 3 of the carbon footprint derived from financed emissions of the Renta Group 4, it comes from the following exposures:\n\n· Direct financed emissions: These are those exposures that involve financing to counterparties through their exposure in the Group's own portfolio, mainly through the acquisition and maintenance on the balance sheet of debt securities and equity instruments.\n\n· Indirect financed emissions: These are those exposures that involve counterparty financing derived from financial guarantees that support credit and guarantee transactions. For this purpose, financial guarantees are made up of liquid financial instruments pledged as security for financing operations. The financial guarantees are considered to indirectly guarantee the exposure to the carbon footprint of the creditor in the proportion that they respectively cover the amount provided in the loans.\n\nThe assets considered from Scope 3 - financed emissions of Renta 4 are as follows:\n\n· Corporate Finance (investment in instruments that finance companies) by direct investment in companies in equity or debt\n\n· Sovereign bonds (investment in fixed income from countries' debt)\n\n· Indirect investment through CII (Collective Investment Institutions)\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to the financed emissions of Renta 4 considering Scope 1, 2 and 3 decreased in absolute terms between 2022 and 2023 from 211,480 tCO2eq to 122,862 tCO2 eq(-42%).\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to Scope 3 of financed emissions taking into account emissions of Scope 1, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested, reduced by 12%, going from 174.4 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 153.3 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023. Also, if we consider only the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the companies in which it is invested, the reduction remains at 12% (from 170.8 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 149.5 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023).\n\n**This decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms is mainly due to the fact that for this year the Renta 4 Portfolio changed considerably, which significantly reduced its investments in sovereign bonds, these being the main component of the carbon footprint of the company's financed emissions.**\n\n|                      | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO₂eq ) |            | Var    | t CO₂eq/M€ |        | Var    |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|--------|\n|                      | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022                | 2023       | (%)    | 2022       | 2023   | (%)    |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3) | 309                | 329   | 95.59       | 25.6   | 7,155.80            | 4,738.88   | -33.8% | 74.86      | 185.14 | 147.3% |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2)    | 309                | 317   | 95.59       | 20.59  | 2,801.19            | 914.87     | -67.3% | 29.31      | 44.42  | 51.6%  |\n| Sovereign bonds*     | 31                 | 29    | 1,050.14    | 661.37 | 200,405.42          | 116,142.07 | -42.0% | 190.84     | 175.61 | -8.0%  |\n| CIIs                 | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22            | 1,981.18   | -49.4% | 58.32      | 17.3   | -70.3% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2-S3)  | 1,969              | 1,631 | 1,212.93    | 801.46 | 211,480.44          | 122,862.12 | -41.9% | 174.35     | 153.3  | -12.1% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2)     | 1,969              | 1,619 | 1,212.93    | 796.46 | 207,125.83          | 119,038.11 | -42.5% | 170.76     | 149.46 | -12.5% |\n\n\\*Consumption emissions excluding the LULUCF sector\n\nRegarding the carbon footprint in relative terms this is due to the decrease in the carbon footprint regarding investments in sovereign bonds and CIIs. In relation to sovereign bonds, the decrease is due to the fact that unlike 2022, in 2023 Renta 4 did not invest in German public debt (this being the country that issued the most in its sovereign bond portfolio). In addition, in relation to collective investment institutions the decrease could be due to a variation (probably improvement) in the quality of the fund footprint data provided by Clarity, so the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the funds in which it has been invested decreased.\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/2 description: The image shows a green icon of a factory next to a building with three horizontal lines on it.

In particular, 1,969 investments included in the calculation of 2022 for a total amount of €1,213 million to the inclusion of 1,676 investments for an amount of €802 million in 2023.\n\nThe carbon footprint relating to Scope 3 of financed emissions taking into account Scope 1 emissions, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested and considering the same sectors as in the calculation of 2022 decreased by 12% going from 174.4 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 153.6 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023.\n\nTherefore, whether we consider the same sectors that were included in the 2022 calculation or consider those recommended by the PCAF reporting standard for the funded emissions related to Scope 1, 2 and 3 of the companies in which it is invested, the results are similar.\n\n|                        | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO₂eq) |            | Var     | t CO₂eq/M€ |        | Var     |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|--------------------|------------|---------|------------|--------|---------|\n|                        | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022               | 2023       | (%)     | 2022       | 2023   | (%)     |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3\"\") | 309                | 374   | 95.59       | 25.91  | 7,155.80           | 4,993.98   | -30.21% | 74.86      | 192.77 | 157.51% |\n| Sovereign bonds*       | 31                 | 29    | 1,050.14    | 661.37 | 200,405.42         | 116,142.07 | -42.05% | 190.84     | 175.61 | -7.98%  |\n| CIIs                   | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22           | 1,981.18   | -49.45% | 58.32      | 17.3   | -70.34% |\n| Total<br>(S1-S2-S3\"\")  | 1,969              | 1,676 | 1,212.93    | 801.77 | 211,480.44         | 123,117.23 | -41.78% | 174.35     | 153.55 | -11.93% |\n|                        | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | Emissions (tCO2eq) |            |         | t CO2eq/M€ |        |         |\n|                        | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022               | 2023       | Var %   | 2022       | 2023   | Var %   |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S3)   | 309                | 329   | 95.59       | 25.6   | 7,155.80           | 4,738.88   | -33.8%  | 74.86      | 185.14 | 147.3%  |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2)      | 309                | 317   | 95.59       | 20.59  | 2,801.19           | 914.87     | -67.3%  | 29.31      | 44.42  | 51.6%   |\n| Quoted CF (S1-S2-S34F) | 309                | 374   | 95.59       | 25.91  | 7,155.80           | 4,993.98   | -30.2%  | 74.86      | 192.77 | 157.5%  |\n\n\\*Consumption emissions excluding the LULUCF sector\n\nNext, we will analyse in detail each of the different types of Scope 3 financed emissions\n\n## *1. Corporate Finance – Direct Investment in Equity or Debt Companies*\n\nIncluding Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which it is invested considering the most polluting sectors and those defined by the PCAF (see calculation method below):\n\n· In 2023, 329 investments in companies through shares or bonds were considered (+20 compared to 2022) for a total of 25.6 million euros (-70 M€ compared to 2022). This decrease in data analysed has been reflected in a decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms that decreased by 34%, accumulating an emissions total of 4,738.88 tCO2eq in 2023. However, it should be noted that in relative terms the carbon footprint increased by 147% from 75 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2022 to 185 tCO2eq /M€ invested in 2023. The significance of this increase is due to the wide variety of methodologies applied by investment companies for the calculation of Scope 3 emissions.\n\nIncluding Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which it is invested considering the same sectors as in 2022:\n\n· In 2023, 374 investments in companies through shares or bonds were considered (+65 compared to 2022) for a total of 25.9 million euros (-70 M€ compared to 2022). In total, the investments of 69 different NACE codes have been analysed, 11 more than the analysis of 2022. This decrease in data analysed considering the total amount of investments has been reflected in a decrease in the carbon footprint in absolute terms that decreased by 30.2%, accumulating an emissions total of 4,993.98 tCO2 eq in 2023. However, it should be noted that in relative terms the carbon footprint increased by 157% from 75 tCO2 eq/M€ invested in 2022 to 192.77 tCO2 eq/M€ invested in 2023. The significance of this increase is due to the wide variety in the methodology applied by the invested companies to calculate their Scope 3 emissions.\n\n# *2. Corporate Finance – Indirect Investment Through Collective Investment Institutions*\n\nThe amount invested in CIIs, mainly in funds, has increased substantially from year to year, however, carbon footprint values have decreased significantly. In the last year, the proportion of funds analysed fell, from covering 51% (1,629 investments) of total investments in 2022 to 46% (1,273 investments) of total investments in 2023 (-22%).\n\nOn the other hand, the amount invested considered increased from €67 million in 2022 to €114 million in 2023. Despite this increase in the amount invested, absolute emissions decreased from 3,919 t CO2 eq in 2022 to 1,981 t CO2 eq in 2023 (-49%). In addition, relative emissions decreased by 70% from 58 tCO2eq /M€ in 2022 to 17 tCO2eq /M€ in 2023.\n\nIn short, in this year more investment has been made in collective investment institutions, obtaining a lower footprint in both absolute and relative terms. The explanation for this phenomenon lies in the decrease in CII carbon footprint figures provided by Clarity AI and it is likely that this is due to an improvement in the quality of information available in the database.\n\n|      | No. of investments |       | M€ invested |        | tCO₂eq   | Var      |      | t CO₂eq/M€ | Var   |      |\n|------|--------------------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|------|------------|-------|------|\n|      | 2022               | 2023  | 2022        | 2023   | 2022     | 2023     | (%)  | 2022       | 2023  | (%)  |\n| CIIs | 1,629              | 1,273 | 67.21       | 114.49 | 3,919.22 | 1,981.18 | -49% | 58.32      | 17.30 | -70% |\n\n<sup>5</sup>Scope 3 considering the same sectors as in the calculation of 2022\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *3. Emissions Financed by Sovereign Bonds*\n\nFor the purposes of comparison of the results of sovereign emissions between one year and another, emissions by consumption are taken as a reference excluding the LULUCF sector, because based on the indications and recommendations of the PCAF this type of emission would reflect a more accurate picture regarding investment in sovereign bonds.\n\nThis category of investment decreased by 37% between 2022 and the end of 2023. Investment in sovereign debt accounted for 87% of the investment analysed and 95% of the financed emissions in 2022 for the respective amounts of 1,050 M€ and 200,405 tCO2eq. At the end of 2023, the investment of Renta 4 in these assets was €661 million representing 83% of the investment and the associated emissions were 116,142 tCO2eq representing 95% of the total financed emissions of 2023.\n\n#### **GHG Emissions Comparison Excluding LULUCF Sectors (PCAF Recommendation)**\n\n|                           | Including sectors<br>LULUCF (t CO₂eq) |            |        | Excluding sectors<br>LULUCF (t CO₂eq) |            |        |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|\n| Sovereign emissions       | 2022                                  | 2023       | (%)    | 2022                                  | 2023       | (%)    |\n| Emissions per production  | 153,431.90                            | 91,302.50  | -40.5% | 169,326.59                            | 97,912.71  | -42.2% |\n| Emissions per consumption | 184,517.33                            | 109,531.86 | -41.6% | 200,405.42                            | 116,142.07 | -42.1% |\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n#### **Distribution of Sovereign Bond Investment by Country**\n\n|          | Investment (M€) | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany  |                 | 2.34%  | -      |\n| Spain    |                 | 15.17% | 0.18%  |\n| Italy    |                 | 80.04% | 95.86% |\n| Portugal |                 | 2.45%  | 3.96%  |\n\nAs regards emissions relative to tons of CO2 eq. emitted for every million euro invested, a reduction of 8% is observed if we consider the emissions by consumption excluding LULUCF. This reduction is due to the fact that, unlike 2022, in 2023 there was no investment in German public debt (only in Spain, Italy and Portugal), with Germany being the most polluting country of these four. In addition, the proportion of investment in Spanish public debt in 2023 was significantly reduced compared to 2022, this being the second most polluting country of the four considered.\n\n#### **Comparative Table GHG/M€ Emissions Excluding LULUCF Sectors (PCAF Recommendation)**\n\n| Sovereign emissions       | Including LULUCF sectors<br>(t CO₂eq/M€) |        |  | Var    | Excluding LULUCF sectors<br>(t CO₂eq/M€) |        |  | Var    |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|--|--------|------------------------------------------|--------|--|--------|\n|                           | 2022                                     | 2023   |  | (%)    | 2022                                     | 2023   |  | (%)    |\n| Emissions per production  | 146.11                                   | 138.05 |  | -5.51% | 161.24                                   | 148.04 |  | -8.19% |\n| Emissions per consumption | 175.71                                   | 165.61 |  | -5.75% | 190.84                                   | 175.61 |  | -7.98% |\n\n#### *Calculation Method – Considerations*\n\nAs reflected throughout this Scope 3 - funded indirect emissions section, a number of changes in the calculation methodology described below have been implemented.\n\n**In line with the recommendations of the PCAF standard for the calculation of emissions related to investment in quoted CF, the following has been included for consideration:**\n\n· Scope 1 and 2 emissions from companies in which investment is made: As in the calculation of 2022, those assets that represented 70% of the investments in listed shares and corporate bonds have been selected and for the remaining 30% data have been sought for those assets belonging to highly polluting sectors.\n\n· Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from companies in which investment is made: In addition to considering assets representing 70% of investments, data have been sought for sectors that the PCAF standard specifies should be included.\n\nIn addition, we have also chosen to calculate the results based on the same methodology used in 2022 for its best comparison.\n\n**Calculation based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions of invested companies**\n\n# **Calculation based on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions of**\n\n**invested companies**\n\n| 2.

In particular, there have been 64 work losses, 49 of them voluntary, 77% of the total and 15 non-voluntary, representing 23%.\n\nIn 2023, 101 new employees were added, of whom 67 were men and 34 were women, 66% and 34% respectively, the details of which are shown in the following tables:\n\n## **New Employees by Geographical Area**\n\n| Geographical area   |                    | Men | Women | No. new<br>employees | %<br>Workforce |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-----|-------|----------------------|----------------|\n| International total |                    | 18  | 11    | 29                   | 29%            |\n| National territory  | Central            | 42  | 16    | 58                   | 81%            |\n|                     | Commercial network | 7   | 7     | 14                   | 19%            |\n| National total      |                    | 49  | 23    | 72                   | 71%            |\n| Total additions     |                    | 67  | 34    | 101                  |                |\n|                     |                    | 66% | 34%   |                      |                |\n\nIn terms of the distribution of new employees by geographical area, a total of 29 employees were added internationally, 29% of the total and 71% at the national level, i.e. 72 new professionals. 58 of them in the central services and 14 in the office network.\n\n#### **New Additions by Category**\n\n| Category       | Men | Women | No. new employees | % Workforce |\n|----------------|-----|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Management     | 1   |       | 1                 | 1%          |\n| Technical      | 63  | 31    | 94                | 93%         |\n| Administrative | 3   | 3     | 6                 | 6%          |\n| TOTAL          | 67  | 34    | 101               |             |\n|                | 66% | 34%   |                   |             |\n\n#### **New Additions by Age**\n\n| Age bracket | Men | Women | No. new employees | % Workforce |\n|-------------|-----|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| <30         | 29  | 16    | 45                | 45%         |\n| [30-40]     | 23  | 6     | 29                | 29%         |\n| [40-50]     | 6   | 9     | 15                | 15%         |\n| >50         | 9   | 3     | 12                | 12%         |\n| TOTAL       | 67  | 34    | 101               |             |\n\nIt should be noted that 45% of new entrants, 45 employees are under the age of 30 and 29 are between the ages of 30 and 40, i.e. 74 under the age of 40 have been added, and this allows Renta 4 to reduce the average age of the workforce and incorporate young professionals with new proposals and visions. On the other hand, it should be noted that during 2023 12 employees over 50 years of age have been added, providing experience and knowledge. This generational diversity brings enrichment to the organisation.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to the type of recruitment, it should be noted that as of December 31, 2023, 99.7% of employees have a permanent employment relationship, if we include the two (2) temporary contracts arising from the partial retirement of two employees prior to their official retirement.\n\nThis level of permanent hiring has been maintained since its inception, thus complying with one of the fundamental principles established in the Renta 4 HR policy, job security. Renta 4 considers that, if employees have a permanent, secure employment relationship in which they can develop their professional career in the long term, they can acquire and gain extensive knowledge in investment products and services, and that this will guarantee the quality of advice on the banking service provided to customers, promoting another fundamental value for Renta 4, which is trust and a close relationship with its customers.\n\nIn addition, permanent employment allows the attraction and retention of talent, maintaining low levels of turnover.\n\nThe types of contracts, classified by gender, age and professional categories for 2023 and 2022, both at the end of the financial years and average number, are shown below:\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Gender**\n\n| Type of Contract         |     | 2023  |       |         |     |       | 2022  |         |  |  |\n|--------------------------|-----|-------|-------|---------|-----|-------|-------|---------|--|--|\n|                          | Men | Women | Total | % Total | Men | Women | Total | % Total |  |  |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 444 | 212   | 656   | 97.9%   | 418 | 199   | 617   | 97.5%   |  |  |\n| Permanent empl. contract |     | 10    | 10    | 1.5%    |     | 11    | 11    | 1.7%    |  |  |\n| Temporary empl. contract | 2   |       | 2     | 0.3%    |     | 2     | 2     | 0.3%    |  |  |\n| Temporary empl. contract | 1   | 1     | 2     | 0.3%    | 2   | 1     | 3     | 0.5%    |  |  |\n| Total                    | 447 | 223   | 670   | 100.0%  | 420 | 213   | 633   | 100.0%  |  |  |\n| % Total                  | 67% | 33%   |       |         | 66% | 34%   |       |         |  |  |\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Category**\n\n|                          | 2023       |           |                |       | 2022       |           |                |       |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|\n| Type of Contract         | Management | Technical | Administrative | Total | Management | Technical | Administrative | Total |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 13         | 599       | 44             | 656   | 13         | 537       | 67             | 617   |\n| Permanent empl. contract |            | 4         | 6              | 10    |            | 4         | 7              | 11    |\n| Temporary empl. contract |            | 2         |                | 2     |            | 1         | 1              | 2     |\n| Temporary empl. contract |            | 1         | 1              | 2     |            | 1         | 2              | 3     |\n| Total                    | 13         | 606       | 51             | 670   | 13         | 543       | 77             | 633   |\n| % Total                  | 2%         | 90%       | 8%             |       | 2%         | 86%       | 12%            |       |\n\n#### **Distribution by Type of Contract and Age**\n\n| Type of contract<br>according to age range | 2023 |         |         |     | 2022  |     |         |         |     |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|---------|---------|-----|-------|-----|---------|---------|-----|-------|\n|                                            | <30  | [30-40] | [40-50] | >50 | TOTAL | <30 | [30-40] | [40-50] | >50 | TOTAL |\n| Permanent empl. contract                   | 108  | 166     | 231     | 151 | 656   | 104 | 170     | 210     | 133 | 617   |\n| Permanent empl. contract                   | 2    | 2       | 1       | 5   | 10    |     | 5       | 3       | 3   | 11    |\n| Temporary empl. contract                   | 1    |         | 1       |     | 2     | 1   |         | 1       |     | 2     |\n| Temporary empl. contract                   |      |         |         | 2   | 2     |     |         |         | 3   | 3     |\n| Total                                      | 111  | 168     | 233     | 158 | 670   | 105 | 175     | 214     | 139 | 633   |\n| % Total                                    | 17%  | 25%     | 35%     | 24% |       | 17% | 28%     | 34%     | 22% |       |\n\n#### **Average Number of Contracts at 31-12-2023 by Gender**\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text.\n\n|                          | Gender |        |        |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Type of Contract         | Men    | Women  | TOTAL  |\n| Permanent empl. contract | 435.25 | 202.75 | 638    |\n| Permanent empl. contract | -

losses, as it is established as it should be included in this SNFI, this being a low turnover level and considered \"healthy\" in organisations.\n\nOn this point, we would also like to highlight that Renta 4 did not make any temporary lay-offs or dismissals during 2023.\n\n## **2. Talent selection**\n\nIn line with Renta 4's HR policy, Renta 4's recruitment process is based on recruiting professionals with a high level of qualifications, training and experience appropriate to each position, assessing the suitability of each candidate, their training and professional merits, thus ensuring the selection of the best professionals in the sector, in order to provide specialised, high-quality banking services.\n\nThis selection policy has as one of its fundamental principles the recruitment of candidates based on the suitability of the candidate to the position, promoting the selection of the best qualified professionals and those who have the best competences for each position, regardless of gender and not associating the skills required with gender, but with the worth of each professional and their suitability for the position.\n\nJobs are defined by focusing on the concrete definition of functions and tasks, aspects and technical knowledge, as well as skills and competencies appropriate for their performance. The model to be followed when defining the posts is:\n\n· Defining the job position and professional profile in a neutral way, avoiding associating skills with gender, always identifying them as professional competences and not as innate personal skills.\n\n· Description of the job requirements and professional profiles of the candidates associated with the posts, being as precise as possible and adjusted to the real needs of the post.\n\n· To assess experience and other job-specific competencies.\n\nIn the selection processes, different sources of recruitment are used, on the one hand, platforms and social networks such as LinkedIn, Infojobs, etc., focused on the selection of professionals, these being channels that allow companies to post job offers, access candidate databases and thus select professionals that fit the profiles and requirements of the positions. Other sources of recruitment used by Renta 4 are applications received through the\n\nvarious online channels of the entity (corporate website, mail, etc.), universities and internal promotion.\n\nIn this sense, the selection processes are carried out mainly internally by the HR department of Renta 4 and only in those processes in which there is a high technical level or complexity when accessing certain types of profiles, the selection process is outsourced to companies specialising in recruitment consulting, although Renta 4 actively participates in all phases of the selection process.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, a total of 71 selection processes were carried out internally, to fill 44 positions each with specific requirements, all of them to fill vacancies that had occurred as a result of the employees' departures due to the turnover of staff and in other cases to fill newly-created posts or as an addition to various departments and areas.\n\nIn these processes, a total of 519 candidates were selected, representing an average of 7 candidates per process, 402 of them male, 77% and 117 women, 23% of the candidates. Of these, a total of 285 professionals were interviewed, 216 men (76%) and 67 women (24%), and a total of 65 professionals were employed, of which 43 were men, 66% and 22 women, 34%.\n\nIt should be noted that, although Renta 4 applies equal criteria in the selection processes, selecting candidates who meet the specific requirements of the positions, regardless of gender, in recent years, in the selection processes, it has established the criterion of including a percentage of at least 50% of female candidates. However, in many of the selection processes, the number of female candidates who register in the job offers published by Renta 4 is less than 50% of all candidates or women candidates do not meet the requirements of the post, and this makes participation in the selection processes difficult for a larger number of female candidates and therefore difficult to recruit them.\n\nAlso, in relation to other sources of recruitment, Renta 4 has been collaborating with universities for many years, considering that training is a fundamental pillar in the field of HR. For this reason, \n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 maintains collaboration agreements with most universities throughout the country, as well as some international universities, in the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Annually, Renta 4 provides training internships in different departments, areas and offices of the entity, in which students carry out a period of curricular or extracurricular internships, in which they learn among other topics about markets and different financial products, taxation, the procedures of the department or office in which they perform the internship, as well as how an investment bank operates.\n\nIn 2023 Renta 4 formalised a total of 69 internships, 22 of them in the offices of the commercial network and 47 internships in the central services, in different departments such as asset management, analysis, corporate, internal control, etc. and with an average duration of between three (3) and six (6) months.\n\nIt should be noted that for those students who perform well during the internship period, their curriculum is added to the database of possible candidates, participating in the selection processes of positions that may arise, with internships being another of the sources of recruitment that Renta 4 uses for the selection of candidates in the selection processes.\n\n#### **3. Remuneration**\n\nThe Remuneration Policy seeks to establish a remuneration scheme appropriate to the engagement and responsibility undertaken by the people to whom it applies, with the aim, first, of attracting, retaining and motivating the most outstanding professionals and, second, helping the company to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries out its activity.\n\nThis policy is based, inter alia, on the following principles:\n\n· It will be compatible with the company's long-term business strategy, objectives, values and interests.\n\n· The remuneration paid by the company in accordance with these principles follows criteria of moderation and proportionality to the group's results, and must encourage sound and effective risk management that prevents conflicts of interests.\n\n· Remuneration shall establish an appropriate balance between fixed and variable components.\n\n· The variable remuneration shall be determined by the achievement of objectives that are set periodically, not being linked to the assumption of high risks.\n\n· The objectives to be evaluated will be individual and strategic. The evaluation of the objectives, their degree of achievement and performance will be analysed annually. The payment of the variable remuneration will depend on the degree of achievement of the objectives set, adjusted to the results obtained by the entity.\n\n· The variable remuneration policy must be aligned with the company's results, being paid only if it is sustainable with the company's financial situation.\n\n· Said policy shall be compatible with appropriate and effective management of risk, and fosters such management in all circumstances, without offering, consequently, incentives for a assuming a level of risk that exceeds the level of risk accepted by the company.\n\nRenta 4's remuneration policy aims to attract and retain talent, incorporating highly-qualified professionals, applying remuneration levels in line with the market, depending, among other things, on the different job positions, level of responsibility, experience, qualifications and performance.\n\nThis remuneration policy is based, on the one hand, on criteria of equality and non-discrimination, pursuing pay equity, and on the other hand, on the individual evaluation of the performance of each employee, depending on the degree of achievement of objectives at individual and corporate level, therefore, based on the meritocracy and performance of each professional.\n\nLikewise, their salary levels seek internal equity within the company and external equity with the market, in order to be competitive and attractive wages, as a tool of attraction and retention, in order to have the best professionals in the sector, to offer a service of quality and excellence.\n\nAnnually Renta 4 carries out a performance evaluation in which the degree of achievement of the quantitative and/or qualitative objectives established, which aim to evaluate and align them with the strategic objectives of the company and professional development is analysed.\n\nIt should be noted that Renta 4 at all times rigorously applies the legal regulations in force in each of the countries in which it operates and is established. In this sense, in general terms, more than 95% of 4-income employees are at wage levels higher than the minimum wages established in the applicable conventions and/ or regulations.\n\nThis NFIR uses the same classification of professional categories as is used in the Annual Accounts containing the Group's financial information and in the various financial statements reported to the supervisors.\n\n#### **Average Remuneration**\n\nThe average remuneration of employees and its evolution is shown in the following tables according to geographical professional classification, gender and age:\n\n#### **Average Remuneration by Category and Geographical Area**\n\n| Average Remuneration6 -

International**\n\n#### **International**\n\nFirst, it is evident that there are large pay differences in the labour markets where Renta 4 carries out its activity and is established; that is, between Spain and the countries of Latin America; Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg, these not being comparable for different reasons. On the one hand, they are very heterogeneous labour markets, where there are great differences in salary levels, and on the other hand, at the organisational level there is a diversity and variety of jobs and therefore different professional profiles, with different types of roles, experience, responsibilities and seniority. All this together with the high levels of turnover that exist in the Latin American countries in which Renta 4 operates and the exchange rate applied in each year, makes them not comparable as remunerations.\n\nInternationally, as reflected in the average remuneration tables, in 2023, there was a 21% wage increase caused mainly by the increase in the workforce in Latin American countries, which was 19% and highlighting that the wage increase was higher in women's remuneration than in them men, thereby reducing the wage gap compared to 2022.\n\nIn contrast, at national level in 2023, the average total remuneration remained stable compared to 2022. In this regard, it should be noted that the total average remuneration includes both fixed and variable remuneration, not reflecting the variations produced in each type of remuneration. The following tables show separately the fixed and variable remuneration for the financial year 2023 and 2022, which shows that the change in average fixed wages was 4% nationally, while variable remuneration has been reduced by 23%, the average total remuneration has remained stable.\n\n#### **Fixed and Variable Remuneration, by Category and Geographical Area**\n\n| Fixed<br>remuneration *<br>-Category-Areas | 2023    | 2022    | Variation %<br>period | Variable<br>remuneration*<br>-Category-Areas | 2023    | 2022    | Variation %<br>period |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|\n| International                              | 34,307  | 29,014  | 18%                   | International                                | 16,769  | 12,694  | 32%                   |\n| Management                                 | 120,697 | 113,359 | 6%                    | Management                                   | 57,936  | 45,618  | 27%                   |\n| Technical                                  | 33,285  | 28,360  | 17%                   | Technical                                    | 16,747  | 13,003  | 29%                   |\n| Administrative                             | 16,513  | 11,547  | 43%                   | Administrative                               | 632     | 152     | 316%                  |\n| National                                   | 54,879  | 52,874  | 4%                    | National                                     | 6,042   | 7,837   | -23%                  |\n| Management                                 | 206,364 | 204,091 | 1%                    | Management                                   | 105,089 | 131,960 | -20%                  |\n| Technical                                  | 53,781  | 52,615  | 2%                    | Technical                                    | 4,432   | 5,946   | -25%                  |\n| Administrative                             | 31,162  | 30,854  | 1%                    | Administrative                               | 488     | 1,082   | -55%                  |\n| Total fixed<br>remuneration                | 52,146  | 49.858  | 5%                    | Total variable<br>remuneration               | 7.424   | 8.451   | -12%                  |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, there is a difference in the average remuneration nationally between men and women, specifically in the professional category of the Technical group, where the largest number of employees of the Group is concentrated, 90% of the staff, the reason for this difference being the wide variety of jobs that fall into this category, with different types of functions, responsibility, experience and seniority and, therefore, a wide range of remuneration.\n\n#### **Average Remuneration, by Category, Gender and Geographical Area**\n\n|                                          |         | 2023    |                               |         | 2022    |                               |     | Variation % Period 23/22 |  |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|-----|--------------------------|--|\n| Average Remuneration -<br>Category-Areas | Men     | Women   | Difference<br>Man vs<br>Woman | Men     | Women   | Difference<br>Man vs<br>Woman | M   | W                        |  |\n| International                            | 58,868  | 30,698  | 28,170                        | 48,266  | 23,281  | 24,985                        | 22% | 32%                      |  |\n| Management                               | 178,633 | -

For this reason, the following table shows only the average fixed remuneration for the financial years 2023 and 2022. This information shows that the differences in fixed wages between the two genders are smaller than the differences shown in total wages and highlights that the overall wage increase for women has been 5%, higher than 4% for men. Internationally, the increase in women's wages has been even greater, being 33% compared to 17% for men and at the national level it has been 5% for women compared to 3% for men.\n\n#### **Fixed Remuneration, by Category, Gender and Geographical Area**\n\n| Fixed remuneration -

Coupled with this, the wage evolution of employees in Renta 4, which depending on factors\n\nsuch as; the degree of demand for the job in the labour market, changes in roles and responsibilities, as well as the evaluation of the individual performance of each worker, has made it possible to generate different wage developments, without, therefore, there being wage discrimination between men and women.\n\nAt the international level, the exchange rate and the different salary levels and differences in the labour markets in each of the countries in which Renta 4 has an international presence have an additional influence, although in all of them, Renta 4 applies the regulations and salary levels in force in each of them.\n\nWith regard to the evolution and results of the wage gap for the financial year 2023, it should be noted that internationally it was reduced by 71%, going from 31% in 2022 to 8.9% in 2023 and nationally the wage gap decreased from 15.6% in 2022 to 10.3% in 2023, falling by 34%.\n\nSimilarly, the wage gap calculated on the basis of fixed remuneration alone has been reduced by 71% internationally and nationally by 39%.\n\n#### **Remuneration of Members of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe average remuneration in euros received in 2023 by the members of the Board of Directors of Renta 4 by gender is shown below:\n\n| Average remuneration       | 2023    |        |         | 2022    |        |         | Variation Average Remuneration<br>2023/2022 |       |       |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                            | Men     | Women  | Total   | Men     | Women  | Total   | Men                                         | Women | Total |\n| Executive Directors        | 379,250 | -      | 379,250 | 415,000 | -      | 415,000 | -8.6%                                       | -     | -8.6% |\n| Non-Executive Directors14  | 90,000  | 95,000 | 92,000  | 80,000  | 80,000 | 80,000  | 12.5%                                       | 18.8% | 15.0% |\n| Total average remuneration | 205,700 | 95,000 | 174,071 | 214,000 | 80,000 | 176,000 | -3.9%                                       | 18.8% | -1.1% |\n\nNon-executive Directors receive remuneration for their being on the Board and, in addition, those who in turn are members of the Board committees receive additional remuneration in this respect.\n\nThe remuneration established for directors is the same for all non-executive directors, regardless of gender.\n\nExecutive directors do not receive any remuneration for their status as directors, but the remuneration is linked and associated with their executive functions in Renta 4.\n\nexecutive directors who are members of one of the committees of the\n\n<sup>12</sup> Total remuneration includes fixed remuneration and variable remuneration\n\n<sup>13</sup> Total remuneration includes fixed remuneration and variable remuneration\n\n<sup>14</sup> Total remuneration is the remuneration as a member of the Board and additionally, those non-executive directors who are members of one of the committees of the board will receive an additional remuneration.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **4. Training**\n\nAs indicated above, specialisation is another of the strategic values of Renta 4 and, therefore, another of the principles on which the HR Policy of Renta 4 is based is the high qualification of its employees.\n\nTo do this, training is one of the fundamental pillars, which allows professionals who form Renta 4 to have the knowledge of financial products and markets and provide customers with specialised and high quality advice, thus providing a differentiating value with other entities.\n\nThe digital environment and its constant transformation requires ongoing training to become a strategic tool, being a differentiating factor in the banking sector, allowing professionals to adapt to constant changes in products, markets, regulatory changes, etc. In addition, to be able to know the needs and aspirations of customers to offer personalised solutions, that add value and based on principles of sustainable investment.\n\nFor this reason, Renta 4 has an annual training plan that provides employees with the necessary technical knowledge, skills and competencies.\n\nIt should be noted that according to MiFID II regulations, professionals who advise and inform customers must have a certain level of qualification, and for this they must be duly certified. In this regard, at Renta 4 at 31 December 2023, 93% of the employees of the commercial network or who perform advisory functions to Renta 4 customers hold one of the qualifications considered valid by the CNMV to comply with said regulations.\n\nIn particular, 80% are in possession of the *European Financial Advisor (EFA),* European Financial Planner (EFP) and/or *European Information Planner (EIP)*  qualifications, all of which certify compliance and issued by the *European Financial Planning Association (EFPA),* a prestigious European association, whose functions are to certify the level of qualification of professionals in the banking sector and provide ongoing training in financial matters. The remaining 20% are in possession of other types of\n\nqualifications; such as wealth manager, financial analyst or any other of the qualifications considered valid by CNMV in compliance with MiFID II.\n\nIn addition, every year Renta 4 provides all employees who are in possession of any of these qualifications and who provide advisory services to customers, with ongoing training so that they can perform the 30 hours of recertification required by said regulations. In 2023, the number of hours of ongoing training carried out by these employees was 6,597 hours.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that since 2006, many years before the MiFID II regulations came into effect, making it compulsory for professionals in the financial and banking sector to have certifications approved by the regulatory bodies, Renta 4 had been training all the professionals in its commercial network in order for them to obtain one of these qualifications, as it considered that this training in financial products, taxation, financial planning, regulations and other basic aspects of the markets was a guarantee of quality when advising customers.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, in addition to training to obtain EFA and other similar qualifications validated by the CNMV, Renta 4 had an ongoing training plan, which included different training designed to provide employees with the knowledge, skills, and competences across every area and department of the company, depending on their training needs of a particular moment.\n\nSpecifically, during the 2023 financial year a total of 18,775.13 hours of training were given in the following training actions, including recertification hours and their distribution by category:\n\n| Training Action Name                                                                         | No. of hours |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Specialisation course in futures and equity options                                          | 66.00        |\n| Electric market course                                                                       | 8.00         |\n| Monographic Course on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism      | 22.67        |\n| Education for access to insurance distribution level 2                                       | 6,013.75     |\n| Access Training for Insurance Distribution Level II IBIPS Module                             | 50.00        |\n| ESG recertification hours (EFPA)                                                             | 218.50       |\n| LCCI recertification hours (EFPA)                                                            | 285.00       |\n| MIFID recertification hours (EFPA)                                                           | 6,093.50     |\n| Hours recertification Insurance (EFPA)                                                       | 1,188.00     |\n| Master in Double Degree (Blockchain Management and Blockchain Engineering) 2023              | 190.00       |\n| OTC'S Interest Rates - Structured Equity                                                     | 446.00       |\n| Effective presentations                                                                      | 72.00        |\n| Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Annually Renta 4 provides these employees with ongoing training of 25 hours, which certifies the recertification in said qualification in insurance, as required by the applicable regulations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 119 employees are in possession of the qualification *of Access to the Distribution of Insurance Level 2,* being able to market these insurance.\n\nAlso, every week Renta 4 electronically provides all its employees different knowledge pills on news in subjects such as; new investment products, market trends, taxation, as well as other issues such as money laundering prevention, technological risks, data protection, etc., all with the aim of keeping Renta 4 employees permanently trained and updated.\n\nIn this sense, it should be noted that in the last financial years Renta 4 considers technological risks one of the most important and of greatest risk for the company and its awareness is a strategic issue for the entity. For this reason, in recent years it has strengthened this area and has been carrying out ongoing training and awareness related to technological risks\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are areas and departments that regularly provide all employees with specific training in the subject matter of their field by regulatory requirement, awareness or strategic reasons of the company, such as in the area of money laundering prevention, regulatory compliance, data protection, etc. cybersecurity, etc., and the contents of which are detailed in each of the specific headings of this SNFI.\n\n# **Importance of In-House Training on Technological Risks**\n\nDuring the last financial year, a series of activities associated with the process of training and raising awareness about matters related to technological risks have been carried out, apart from those provided by the Security office or the risk management office:\n\n· Workshops on applicable regulations in the fields of Information Technology and Cybersecurity.\n\n· Training courses specific for the Board of Directors on technological risk management and third-party risks.\n\n· Preparing knowledge pills on security and thirdparty risks.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5. Company Relations**\n\nRenta 4 does not have a collective bargaining agreement at company level; however, the company applies the corresponding collective bargaining agreement to each of the companies and employees at the national level, according to their sector of activity, with the following agreements being applicable:\n\n| Company            | Collective agreement                        |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| R4 Banco           | Collective Agreement of the Banking Sector  |\n| R4 SV              | Collective agreement Stock Market of Madrid |\n| R4 Gestora         | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| R4 Pensiones       | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| R4 Corporate       | Madrid Offices Collective Agreement         |\n| Renta 4 Chile      | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Peru       | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Colombia   | No Agreement                                |\n| Renta 4 Luxembourg | No Agreement                                |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, as shown in the following table, 86.7% of Renta 4's employees were covered by one of the aforementioned Spanish collective bargaining agreements, while the remaining 13.3% of the workforce is not covered by such agreements, as they provide their services in the companies abroad, in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg, where there are no applicable collective agreements, although we should state that there are employment regulations. In this regard, it should be noted that Renta 4 complies and rigorously applies at all times with the regulations in force in each of these countries: Chile, Peru, Colombia and Luxembourg.\n\n| Agreement              | No. of<br>employees | % Employees | No. Employees<br>subject to<br>agreement | % Employees<br>subject to<br>agreement |\n|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Banking Agreement      | 461                 | 68.81%      | 581                                      | 86.7%                                  |\n| Stock Market Agreement | 5                   | 0.75%       |                                          |                                        |\n| Madrid Offices         | 115                 | 17.16%      |                                          |                                        |\n| No Agreement           | 89                  | 13.28%      | 89                                       | 13.3%                                  |\n| TOTAL                  | 670                 | 100.00%     | 670                                      | 100.00%                                |\n\nAlso, despite the heterogeneous nature of the applicable collective agreements, Renta 4 applies homogeneous criteria and measures regarding work organisation, always seeking the homogeneous benefit of Renta 4's employees based on internal and external equality in Spain and abroad.\n\nRegarding social relations, Renta 4 does not have legal representation for workers. However, the Group keeps all its employees duly informed about the different policies and measures that the Company applies in the different areas, using the available communication channels, including an Employees' Portal, the company's intranet and various communications sent by email.\n\nIt should be noted that employees have channels that allow them a fluid and accessible communication, where suggestions, complaints and any type of proposals are collected, which the entity takes into consideration at all times, evaluating and studying each case.\n\nAlso, the Group has an Equality Plan, in accordance with the applicable Spanish law, to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for women and men, this being applicable through the adoption and implementation of various policies for this purpose, such as the promotion and guarantee of equal opportunities for selection and professional development at all levels of the company, and policies adapted to different social changes\n\nAs well, Renta 4 has a Protocol for the Prevention, Treatment, and Elimination of Sexual Harassment on the Grounds of Gender and Discrimination, in which it establishes the protocol for these types of issues. In particular, any employee can communicate these types of complaints through the electronic mailbox indicated in the protocol and created for that purpose or by presenting a letter in person.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there is also a Complaints Channel in Renta 4, which in the event that the Renta 4 Compliance Unit detects the receipt of any complaint, would immediately transfer the information and documentation, complying with the strictest duty of confidentiality to the HR management.\n\nIn this sense, Renta 4 expresses its resounding rejection, in the face of any unwanted behaviour of a sexual character or connotation, that has the purpose or produces the effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, degrading or offensive environment, and it undertakes not to tolerate such behaviours and to collaborate effectively in the prevention, detection, correction and sanction of this type of behaviour in the field of the company. During the financial year 2023 Renta 4 did not receive or process any complaints regarding harassment.\n\n#### **6. Work organisation**\n\nWith regard to the organisation of the work of the entity, Renta 4 has always aimed to improve the balance and reconcile the personal, family and work life of all its employees. Through this, it aims to improve the working environment, increase productivity and the attraction and retention of talent and for this have been implemented in recent years different measures, based on the flexibility and responsibility of professionals who form Renta 4, some of these measures are as follows:\n\n· Working hours with an annual estimate of 1,700 hours that do not exceed the amount established in applicable collective agreements.\n\n· Flexibility in check-in, check-out and meal rest times. There are flexibility measures in clocking in/ out and in break or food times, for those employees whose job characteristics and work centre allow it.\n\n· Adaptation of the working day duration and distribution, including remote working, duly justified and reasoned in these cases.\n\n· Hybrid model of teleworking in the headquarters of Renta 4. During the 2023 financial year, a hybrid teleworking model was maintained in those central services of the bank and in those departments that, due to the type of work and systems used it is feasible, and where it has been confirmed that said model is efficient, to combine face-toface and telematic work, without exceeding 30% of teleworking time. In this way, measures and\n\npolicies of flexibility and reconciliation of personal and family life continue to be implemented and strengthened.\n\n· Birth, adoption and foster care. All workers who make requests have the right to suspend their employment contract in case of birth, adoption, and fostering within the terms and means established by the Law, allowing the worker to enjoy such permits on a part-time basis, subject to agreement with the Company. Include the figures for 2023 and 2022, highlighting the number of permits enjoyed by parents\n\n· Breastfeeding permit. Employees who make the relevant request have one hour of breastfeeding leave per day until their child reaches 9 months of age, which may be split into two periods, one at the beginning and one at the end of the working day. Similarly, those employees who request it replace the breastfeeding permit, accumulating it over a period of 15 working days, being able to extend it up to the age of 12 months of the minor, provided that they enjoy it simultaneously, with the proportional reduction of the salary.\n\n· Reduction of working hours. Workers who make the relevant request shall have the right to reduce working hours to a maximum of half of the working day and a minimum of one-eighth of the working day for legal guardianship and/or direct care of a family member, and a proportional reduction in salary shall be considered following the specifications established in applicable collective agreements and regulations.\n\n· Leaves of absence for different reasons. Employees may request leaves of absence for several reasons, including the care of children and direct family members, preserving their job or the same professional group, and the exercise \n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nof a public position that is incompatible with their job, following the regulations established in applicable collective agreements and regulations.\n\n· Unpaid leave. Employees may request unpaid leave in case of, for example, duly accredited family needs, care of relatives up to the first degree of consanguinity or affinity, and the completion of higher education or PhDs.\n\n· Renta 4 has a Digital Disconnection Policy.\n\n#### **Absenteeism - Leave for Birth and Care of Child**\n\nWith regard to the absenteeism figures relating to suspensions for childbirth and childcare (maternity and paternity), as well as those relating to occupational accidents, the data on the number of absence hours during 2023 and 2022 are shown.\n\n#### **Hours of Absenteeism for Birth and Care of Child**\n\nThe number of absence hours have been calculated considering the number of effective working hours per day (7.75 hours per day, full time, or its equivalent on a part-time basis) by the number of working days of absence\n\n| Leave type                        | 2023      | 2022      | Variation % |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Birth and care of child           | 12,777.81 | 11,524.25 | 11%         |\n| Men                               | 8,321.56  | 6,324.00  | 32%         |\n| Women                             | 4,456.25  | 5,200.25  | -14%        |\n| Birth and care of child part-time | 1,549.76  | 937.75    | 65%         |\n| Men                               | 1,240.00  | 705.25    | 76%         |\n| Women                             | 309.76    | 232.50    | 33%         |\n| Total hours                       | 14,327.57 | 12,462.00 | 15%         |\n\n#### **Absenteeism – Accidents at Work**\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year there were a total of six occupational accidents, one fewer than 2022, of which only three resulted in medical leave, those which occurred while commuting.\n\nThe following tables show the number of occupational accidents according to their classification, seriousness and frequency, as well as the number of absence hours due to these accidents, distributed by gender.\n\n| Type of occupational accident                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2023   | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Commuting                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 237.34 | -

Therefore, Renta 4 strictly complies with the applicable regulations where it develops its activity.\n\nIn relation to occupational accidents and occupational diseases, in the 2023 financial year Renta 4 Banco, S.A. and Renta 4 Gestora SGIIC, S.A. had MAZ (0011) contracted as the Mutual Insurance Company for Occupational Accidents and had S.A., Renta 4 Pensiones, S.A., Renta 4 S.V., S.A. and Renta 4 Corporate contracted to Umivale Activa (0015).\n\nThe above mentioned insurance companies are responsible, for example, for the management of contingencies arising from occupational accidents and diseases, the provision of benefits derived from them, coverage and health care, management of occupational accident reports and preventive activities, as well as the management, control, and monitoring of economic benefits and temporary disability arising from common contingencies.\n\nIn the area of Occupational Risk Prevention Renta 4 has contracted a service of prevention of external risks, through the entity, VALUES PREVENTION, which carries out the provision of services of preventive activities of occupational risks in the field of health surveillance and technical specialities, thus complying with the regulations on prevention.\n\nSpecifically, VALORA PREVENCIÓN carries out the risk assessment in the facilities of the 63 offices it has nationwide, as well as the risk assessment of the different job positions that exist in the company.\n\nAlso, regarding health control, Renta 4 offers all its employees the possibility of having a complete medical examination on an annual basis, through VALORA PREVENCIÓN. Such medical examinations are voluntary and confidential and are intended, on the one hand, to enable the Company to confirm whether or not its employees are fit for the performance of work, not receiving any additional information on the results because they are confidential and, on the other hand, that employees can know their health status, in an agile manner and with extensive medical tests that allow to carry out a preventive medical activity of early detection of diseases.\n\nIn this sense, it should be noted that in recent years Renta 4 has incorporated additional tests in the analytical analysis with the aim of detecting in a preventive way possible pathologies and frequent diseases that could suffer employees, such as heart disease, prostate cancer, colon, diabetes, etc. In general, the number of employees who carry out such medical examinations annually exceeds 50% of the workforce and is highly valued by employees.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 has, among others, the corresponding Risk Prevention Plan, Annual Activity Report and Emergency Plan. On the other hand, Renta 4 promotes other activities such as training, giving courses for employees on occupational risks in facilities and first aid. These courses are given by an external provider through the ORP contract and such training is given with the frequency recommended by the ORP regulations and according to the needs of each area or office in each financial year.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4, supplementing preventive activities and health care, has two (2) defibrillators called *AED PLUS (ZOLL) installed at its headquarters,* in order to be able to assist in case of need any cardiac type emergency that could occur in the facilities of Renta 4 and periodically these devices are reviewed and the corresponding maintenance is performed. Since its installation it has not been necessary to use it.\n\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that since 2017 the European Commission has been pointing out the importance of psychosocial risks, especially occupational stress, as one of the most complex and growing health problems at work. It has been recognised that this stress has harmful effects on both the health of the worker and the organisation of work and to him half of the days of lost work, reduces the performance and can lead to an increase in the work accidents.\n\nFor this reason, during the year 2023 Renta 4 has carried out a Psychosocial Risk Assessment (Climate Survey) by an external company, whose objective was to identify and measure the working conditions related to the organisation of work and that could represent a risk to health. The results treated collectively and anonymously serve to improve working conditions if necessary.\n\nAt this point it is necessary to highlight the wide participation of the employees of Renta 4 and the results that have been obtained from it have been satisfactory, without having detected any area in which the entity must act, considering that the working climate in Renta 4 in general is adequate.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 promotes activities aimed at the health care of its employees, such as physical activity in the facilities of the central services of the entity, where employees have an adapted space for the realisation of directed sports activities, such as yoga, yoga, sports and sports activities. pilates and \"Moreta Method\" which is a type of postural gymnastics taught by physiotherapists. Activities co-financed by Renta 4.\n\nIn addition, during the last financial years Renta 4 has organised activities outside the workplace, on the one hand, a padel tournament for employees, which has been well received and has allowed in addition to practising a sport, encouraging the feeling of belonging and reinforcing the team building and a golf tournament. Annually Renta 4 has organised for the children of employees a children's Christmas party, a Christmas contest and the construction by employees of a Christmas \"Portal of Bethlehem\" with recycled figures.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 promotes solidarity and volunteering activities, such as collaboration in the preparation of Christmas baskets with the NGO AVANZA, blood donation campaigns with the Spanish Red Cross, as well as the organisation of a Christmas market for charitable purposes.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 shows a clear commitment to respect for human rights. To realise this involvement, it has internal policies and procedures that are applied in all activities and at all levels. This commitment is the basis for all the relationships that Renta 4's entities establish with their stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, public administration and official bodies and society as a whole).\n\n## **1. Internal procedures and processes**\n\nThis approach is implemented through:\n\n- **1.** internal procedures and processes;\n- **2.** monitoring mechanisms;\n- **3.** internal and external channels to strengthen risk identification.\n\nBelow is a summary of the main indicators reflecting this fundamental principle and the most important milestones that have been achieved during 2023.\n\n#### **1.1. Code of Conduct**\n\nThere is a Code of Conduct, a top-level internal standard approved by the Board of Directors, consistent with international treaties, conventions and agreements (such as the United Nations Global Compact, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation).\n\n# <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>Human rights\n\nThis standard establishes general guidelines for action, in addition to the mission and values of Renta 4. These include:\n\n· Ethical behaviour.\n\n· Equality and non-discrimination, with the consequent prohibition of all types of harassment, intimidation, offensive or improper behaviour (including sexual proposals or suggestions) and other actions that may affect a person's dignity.\n\n· Work-life balance.\n\n· Information security.\n\n· Confidentiality.\n\n· Respect for the right to privacy and personal data protection.\n\n· Respect for intellectual property.\n\n· Occupational risk prevention.\n\n· Responsibility, which must also be reflected in accountability and the preservation of fair competition behaviours.\n\n· Due diligence in the use of resources.\n\n· Best practices in public tenders.\n\nLikewise, the Code of Conduct describes the general guidelines to be taken into account in its relationships with stakeholders:\n\n· Responsibility towards customers: Renta 4's relationship with its customers is based on transparency of information and acting in their best interests. These guidelines of conduct include investor protection, safeguarding assets and funds, financial responsibility and personal data protection.\n\n· Responsibility towards employees: for Renta 4, the relationship with employees is fundamental to safeguard fundamental rights. Firstly, because corporate culture is reflected in its work and the way it interacts with stakeholders, that is, by\n\nprotecting the rights of third parties. Secondly, because one of the Renta 4's maxims is to promote a work environment that fosters personal development.\n\n· Responsibility with suppliers: in the processes of approval, selection and contracting of suppliers for the acquisition of goods and services, Renta 4 will ensure competition, avoiding any type of interference that could compromise both the impartiality and transparency of the supplier selection process, in accordance with the Outsourcing Policy. It also ensures that third parties comply with principles and values similar to those applied by Renta 4 in its activities, assessing nonfinancial risks in its approvals.\n\n· Responsibility towards Public Administration and Official Bodies: Renta 4 Group is committed to collaborate and act with diligence in its relations with the competent authorities, to fiscal transparency and the prohibition of corruption and bribery. This matter is addressed in the 'Corruption and Bribery' section of this document.\n\n## **1.2. Rules of conduct for investor protection**\n\nCurrent securities market regulations require investment firms to provide their services honestly, fairly and professionally, in the best interests of their customers. Furthermore, banking regulation is committed to the defence of the banking customer in two directions:\n\n**1.** Through solvency requirements for credit institutions, aimed at market stability\n\n**2.** Promoting transparency in entity-customer relationships.\n\nThese premises, as reflected in the section on the Code of Conduct, form the basis of the daily work of all the people who make up Renta 4. Respecting and safeguarding standards of conduct not only achieves positive results with customers, but also creates value for society as a whole. One of Renta 4's values, set out in the Code of Conduct, is worth mentioning: Renta 4 aims to promote investment to improve people's lives. To this end, it is committed\n\nto moving towards a more sustainable and efficient world that contributes to the progress of society. In the financial system, the Renta 4 seeks to participate in innovation and the positive transformation of the economy. This vision is translated into a slogan that is communicated and disseminated internally to employees and externally to society: \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE AND SOCIETY\".\n\nFrom a practical point of view, this maxim has materialised in this financial year in the following way:\n\n· Through the analysis of regulatory obligations for investor protection and the internal development of projects to improve policies, procedures and processes.\n\n· Through the incorporation of good practices in the sector.\n\n· With the implementation of the supervisor's and auditors' recommendations and suggestions for improvement.\n\n· Working on the revision of the Customer Service mail service, which is seen as fundamental in improving the quality of services.\n\n· Implementing regulations and best practices related to sustainable finance in the area of investor protection, such as:\n\n- Adapting the suitability assessment (a questionnaire prior to the provision of portfolio management and investment advisory services aimed at understanding investment objectives, time horizon and financial situation) has been adapted to include a block where the customer can indicate their sustainability preferences.\n\n- Revising the information provided to customers prior to contracting products and services has been reviewed to incorporate sustainability features where appropriate.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Monitoring standardised information on the target market for sustainable products in order to modify processes and provide the right information to customers. These developments progress as instrument manufacturers provide data in a standardised way, to marketers.\n\n· Including the new requirements of the CNMV Guide on the assessment of suitability and good practices in the sector. The new processes have allowed for increased retail investor protection at various stages of the contracting process:\n\n- Determining whether or not a product is appropriate in accordance with the knowledge and experience of the customer;\n\n- Improving transparency in customer information\n\n- Adjusting the distribution procedures for certain products.\n\n#### **1.3. Personal data protection and information security**\n\nThe protection of personal data is a fundamental right recognised in Articles 18(4) of the Constitution, 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union.\n\nThe work carried out by Renta 4 to protect the personal data of data subjects is based on the principles of proactive responsibility, continuous improvement and privacy through design and by default.\n\nRenta 4, at the national level, has an Information Security Policy and Personal Data Protection, as well as different rules and procedures based on good practices and regulations whose objective is to safeguard the information assets of Renta 4, as well as to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, security and security of information. traceability and availability of sensitive information of Renta 4 and its customers. In addition, on an annual basis or when a significant change or event occurs, the safety regulatory body is reviewed and relevant employees and third parties are reached out for adherence.\n\nOn the other hand, the top management of Renta 4 is highly committed to the security of the entity's information. That is why the Information Security Committee meets on a quarterly basis, which deals with, among others, the following topics: Changes in the environment, security incidents and security and privacy initiatives. In addition, at least once a year, the Security Committee sets the annual information security and privacy strategy and targets. And at least twice a year, the Board of Directors meets to regularly monitor cybersecurity, including this issue on the agenda of its meetings. The Group's security manager is responsible for preparing and presenting the main information security issues of Renta 4 through the preparation of periodic reports.\n\nRenta 4 has standards applicable to all entities (national and foreign) that allow compliance with local regulations and the principles defined in internal regulations.\n\nRegarding data protection, Renta 4 attempts to support transparency and to comply in a timely manner with the management of the rights of access, rectification, opposition, erasure (\"the right to be forgotten\"), restriction of processing, portability and not to be subject to automated decisions. The applications received in 2023 have been handled satisfactorily.\n\n#### **The Importance of Cybersecurity**\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most relevant concerns of the Renta 4 Group due to the fact that there is constant interconnection through telecommunications, which results in more vulnerabilities within information systems. To mitigate this risk, it is constantly working to raise awareness and train each and every one of its employees and customers. There is an annual training and awareness plan for employees, which is reviewed annually. In addition, training and awareness content has been created published on the web so that all customers in order to prevent them from being victims of possible fraud and / or scams. On the other hand, cybersecurity tips and best practices are regularly sent to customers through commercial channels.\n\nRenta 4 Group is committed to the fight against cybercrime by ensuring proper information security management and continuous improvement of cybersecurity.\n\nOn an annual basis, Renta 4 reviews the Information Security and Personal Data Protection Policy, which is sent to all employees, along with security and privacy guidelines adjusted to the work position. In addition, all the standards and procedures that make up the Group's document system are reviewed and updated.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year Renta 4 carried out the following actions, inter alia:\n\n· Quarterly meetings of the Information Security Committee.\n\n· Collaborating in a coordinated manner with the privacy, risk and continuity departments to ensure adequate information security.\n\n· Maintaining the entity's entire document system up to date, tailoring all its content to market security standards.\n\n· Assessing, improving and maintaining the security of the data processing centre facilities.\n\n· To implement all standards and procedures developed in the area of Information Security.\n\n· Conducting ongoing information security assessments, identifying points of improvement, implementing action plans to improve the maturity of Renta 4 cybersecurity and constantly tracking cyber threats affecting the entity's assets.\n\n· Being in constant coordination with all the countries where Renta 4 carries out its activity in order to achieve the correct level of Information Security.\n\n· Performing tests of the Renta 4 technological contingency plan that includes events with cybersecurity components\n\nThe entity is committed to working with cybersecurity in order to achieve optimum and adequate levels of protection in its systems. To this end, it strives to constantly advance and improve its level of security.\n\n# **1.4. Prevention of market abuse**\n\nRegulation indicates that market abuse damages the integrity of financial markets and public confidence and impedes transparency, which is essential for trading.\n\nThe way in which the work this year has contributed to the fight against market abuse were as follows:\n\n· Have an Internal Rules of Conduct. These internal rules, which are no longer mandatory, are maintained and enhanced to disseminate to employees the internal procedures for (i) avoiding and managing conflicts of interest; (ii) personal transactions; or (iii) reporting indications of market manipulation and insider trading.\n\n· Drawing up Renta 4's asset inventory with the participation of all areas of Renta 4.\n\n· Classifying Renta 4's assets using the five dimensions (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, availability and auditability) and MAGERIT.\n\n· Making improvements to the remote-work process.\n\n· Preparing the annual training and awareness plan based on information security for Renta 4.\n\n· Improving standards and procedures for event management and reporting.\n\nIt should be stated that within all these points of improvement Renta 4 works daily to maintain the security of its systems, also having security systems such as: protection mechanisms against Denial of Service attacks, with different levels of Firewall that protect the Group's network, anti-malware systems, etc. In addition to the above, it has the necessary information to prevent, protect and respond to security and operational events.\n\nOn the other hand, Renta 4 has implemented a labelling system through Microsoft's AIP solution that allows encrypting information according to the Renta 4 taxonomy preventing unauthorised use and leakage of sensitive information from the entity.\n\nFinally, Renta 4 is implementing an event correlation solution that allows to improve the monitoring and detection of events that may affect Renta 4 cybersecurity. For these reasons, each year sets a series of objectives that are aligned with the needs of the Group. The next defined goals are:\n\n· To continue to train and raise awareness of Information Security amongst all employees.\n\n· To implement asset tagging throughout the Group using an automated tool.\n\n· Initiating certification of the ISO 27001:2022 best practice standard.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Work has been done on improving the systems and processes for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the supervisor.\n\n· Corporate Governance: information on corporate governance issues is mainly reflected in two documents:\n\n- The Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration.\n\n- The Annual Corporate Governance Report. Both documents are publicly available on the CNMV's website.\n\n· All employees in the commercial network have been trained to raise awareness of the need to detect suspicious transactions and to communicate them to appropriate departments for analysis.\n\n· Link: https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/ee/informaciongobcorp.aspx?TipoInforme=1&nif=A82473018\n\n· Identification of sensitive and prohibited activities and controls of the Renta 4 Group to prevent the risks of incurring in the offences regulated in articles 284 285, 285 bis, 285 ter and 285 quater of the Criminal Code.\n\n#### **1.5. Prevention of criminal risks**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group has an effective model of organisation and management of criminal risks.\n\nThe model consists of the following elements:\n\n- · Code of Conduct,\n- · Procedure for dealing with breaches of the model,\n- · Regulatory procedure for the internal information system,\n- · Disciplinary system,\n- · Regulations of the Compliance Unit\n- · Map of criminal risks with associated controls.\n\nAlso included in the model are the other agreements, policies, codes and protocols approved by Renta 4 on the prevention of criminal offences and regulatory compliance, including internal rules of supervision and control derived from or relating to the Internal Rules of Conduct or any of the other procedures. All this without prejudice to the internal rules specifically approved by the subsidiaries of Renta 4 for the correct implementation of the model in its scope of action.\n\nThe model described is applicable to the companies that make up the Renta 4 Group in Spain.\n\nWithin the model, sensitive and prohibited activities in which Renta 4 entities may be involved have been identified and that could lead to crimes against moral integrity, sexual harassment or hatred and praise:\n\n· Interpersonal relations between professionals of the same or different rank in the exercise of social activity of Renta 4.\n\n· Interpersonal relations of the members of the Renta 4 Group with third parties in the exercise of the social activity of Renta 4.\n\n· Public communications or through social networks and media by income staff 4.\n\nIn order to avoid these risks, general and specific mitigating controls are in place. The general controls are as follows: (i) Code of Conduct; (ii) 4 Income Structure; (iii) Complaints Channel; (iv) Regulatory Procedure of the Internal Information System; (v) Protocol of Action for Non-compliance with the Model; (vi) Disciplinary System; (vii) Regulations of the Compliance Unit; (viii) Audits; (ix) Training and Awareness; (x) Procedures for the selection and approval of suppliers.\n\nFor its part, the specific controls created to mitigate the risks exposed are: Policies on equality and non-discrimination; policies on the prevention of harassment at work; communication channel especially aimed at better treatment of harassment; in the selection of staff, the suitability of the candidate for the job required is determined as a determining factor, which is assessed solely on the basis of his or her previous experience and training; in internal promotion, an annual performance evaluation system is established based on objective criteria of merit and capacity.\n\n## **1.6. Third party risk prevention**\n\nThe entity has a series of risk prevention policies and, specifically, when outsourcing a service, it has drawn up the Outsourcing policy: this document defines the guidelines that must be taken into account in the decision-making, formalisation, management and control process when outsourcing to a third party the provision of the Renta 4 Group's own functions, both in normal and crisis situations.\n\nRenta 4 Group entities go through the following phases in every outsourcing process: (I) Opportunity assessment; (II) Detailed analysis and approval; (III) Tendering and awarding; (V) Implementation; (V): Monitoring; (VI) Reporting; and (VII) Exit or Renewal.\n\nmanagement, good practices on the different types of existing attacks, proper management of corporate social networks, social engineering, fraud and the use of corporate devices.\n\nIn terms of targets for 2024 the following is highlighted:\n\n· A training and awareness plan on information security has been approved by the Security Committee in October 2023. Although it has already started, the goal is to launch it throughout 2024\n\n· Personal data protection training for all employees.\n\n#### **2. Presence in the media**\n\nThroughout 2023, Renta 4 has been present 12,315 times in publications in the written press, web and print media, radio and television. It maintains a good presence both in volume and in the quality of the appearances.\n\nIn this way, Renta 4 is committed to fostering dialogue with its stakeholders and consolidating its position on the platforms as a stronghold of information and training.\n\nAs in previous years, the Group's reputation has been measured in order to detect potential sources of reputational risk, level of trust among users, identify more common topics and increase brand recognition and positioning. In this regard, it is worth mentioning:\n\n· 2023 has been a positive year in terms of reputation and presence in media with specialised content in the sector and general media in which it has an increasing presence. Renta 4 continues to advance to become a reference for economic and market information, but, in addition, increases corporate information where it is not only a source of information, but \"Renta 4\" is the protagonist.\n\nThe factors that Renta 4 considers when carrying out due diligence on a potential service provider relate to: the nature of the provider and its capabilities, its ethical principles, the processing of personal data that it may carry out and the security and internal control measures that it has in place.\n\nIn accordance with the above, among other aspects, the company evaluates whether the supplier: (i) complies with Renta 4's values and Code of Conduct; (ii) acts ethically and with social responsibility; (iii) respects international standards on human rights, environmental protection and appropriate working conditions, including the prohibition of child labour; (iv) has a reputation and culture compatible with Renta 4's standards; (v) has a liability prevention model and (vi) has high ethical, behavioural and Social Responsibility principles in accordance with its profession, sector and jurisdiction.\n\n#### **1.7. Awareness raising and training**\n\nDuring 2022, training and awareness-raising procedures on privacy and personal data protection were approved so that all Renta 4 employees internalise key aspects on this matter and integrate them into their daily work. Training employees as important as, for example, the procedure for an early resolution of events related to data security.\n\nTo this end, throughout 2023 the corporate intranet has continued to be updated and enriched with training security content through policies, standards, procedures and training videos.\n\nThe regular sending of newsletters, as awarenessraising pills, has also been maintained during the 2023 financial years, on aspects related to:\n\n· Personal data protection;\n\n· Procedures included in the ICN;\n\n· Information security.\n\nOn the latter subject, the most important ones are related to safe Internet browsing, asset\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Negative news appearances in the media have been very few and all of them with a \"mild\" rating in relation to reputational risk. The impacts of this news (21) classified as \"mild negative\" represent 0.016% of the total impacts of 2023. The rest is classified as neutral, positive or very positive.\n\n· Again, in 2023 it is observed that the positive reputation of Renta 4 Banco continues to rise. It should be noted that the environment is becoming more complicated every year given the increase in controversial headlines in all media (clickbait, fake news...) and in a sector (banking/financial) punished by continuous reputation crises for more than a decade.\n\n· In addition, 2023 has been a year in which, through the campaign of the Easy account, Renta 4 has doubled the annual investment in presence, through campaigns and paid content, to give greater visibility to the product and the brand. A product that democratises investment by being oriented toward the retail segment.\n\n· Continuing with the previous point, throughout 2023, Renta 4 has installed the first giant canvas. This, covers the entire building, under construction, of Paseo de la Habana 63 since May 2023, with a message that indicates the following \"A bank where any investor is a great customer\". This same message has been used to cover the façades of the offices that have been under construction for remodelling of façade and interiors.\n\n· Finally, the \"Investment for All\" campaign, which is developed with a 100% target aimed at raising awareness of society about the accessibility of investment for anyone. This communication action is one of the actions that are developed within the framework of the SDG to reduce inequality, acquired by the entity in this sense. A campaign that has impacted more than 300,000 unique users through social channels, with different versions of videos that demystify investment and direct them to a website (invertir-para-todos.com) with content.\n\n#### **3. Monitoring**\n\n Human rights monitoring seeks to gather information on the human rights situation in a country or region using available methods, with the aim of participating in advocacy activities against human rights violations.\n\nTo do this, various indicators are applied such as participation, self-identification, data breakdown, privacy, transparency and accountability.\n\nIn the scope of the action of Renta 4, work is carried out to monitor the application of the various rules of conduct and protection of the rights of people applying as principle the primary use of due diligence that is necessary to integrate improvements in it process.\n\nThis monitoring work allows: (i) identify risks to prevent and mitigate them promptly; (ii) assess the effectiveness of controls; and (iii) identify processes and procedures to be updated.\n\nThe main work carried out in 2023, separated by the indicators described in the previous section, is described below:\n\n· Code of Conduct: In 2023, the Code of Conduct was extended to foreign affiliates: (i) all of them have formally adhered to through the approval of the document by their respective boards of directors, and (ii) have established internal procedures to strengthen communication to employees and obtain their signature.\n\n· Standards of Conduct: Among the works carried out during 2023, the update of the policies of regulatory compliance, classification of customers, product governance, incentives, commercial communications, minimum records and recordings.\n\n· Protection of personal data: During the year 2023 we have worked on the following objectives:\n\n- Development of the tasks necessary to implement the recommendations and suggestions for improvement resulting from the voluntary data protection audit completed in December 2022.\n\n- Advance in the review of risk analysis of data processing for which Renta 4 entities are responsible. In addition, a procedure has been approved for the review of data protection measures that aims to define the elements that trigger the review and updating of measures on the concept and design of the treatment, governance and policies, data protection by default and from the design, prevention and management of personal data breaches and security.\n\n- Continuous monitoring of privacy area policies and procedures. It highlights the joint work between the parent company and foreign subsidiaries to bet on principles of personal data protection at the level of the Renta 4 Group.\n\n- Training and awareness: From the area of privacy, the application of the principles of data protection is promoted by all employees of Renta 4. For this, all procedures are made available to workers, after explanation. In addition, work has been done on a new training for all employees, which will be launched in 2024.\n\n· Information security: The main projects and works that have been carried out in 2023 have been described in section 5.1.3 Protection of personal data and information security, in the section The relevance of cybersecurity.\n\n· Prevention of market abuse: In addition to the projects already described, a new revision of the Internal Rules of Conduct was carried out in 2023.\n\n· Prevention of criminal risks: A comprehensive review of the organisation and control model for the prevention of criminal risks was carried out in 2023. Work has been done to update the inherent and residual risks of the Spanish entities integrated in the model, as well as the map that collects the controls that are available. As part of this project, all the procedures that make up the model have been strengthened: (i) Complaints channel procedure (with the news contained in Law 2/2023, of 20 February, regulating the protection of persons who report regulatory violations and the fight against corruption); (ii) protocol for action against breaches; (iii) Regulations of the Compliance Unit and (iv) the disciplinary system.\n\n· In addition, a project has been initiated to update the model of prevention of criminal risks of foreign affiliates that complies with local regulations and income standards 4.\n\n· Training and awareness-raising: During 2023, the following training and reminders were carried out to mitigate the risks described. In particular, it highlights:\n\n- The formation of market abuse to the commercial network\n\n- Training and awareness-raising in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing for all employees\n\n- Information security training and awareness for all employees\n\n- Awareness of outsourcing risks\n\n- Awareness-raising on personal data protection\n\n- Awareness of standards of conduct in the stock market\n\n- Awareness of the complaints channel\n\nImage /page/168/Picture/26 description: The image shows the number 169 in white text on a green background.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-169-0\"></span>Derived from the Monitoring Work, the Following Data Are Confirmed:\n\n| Material fines, penalties and compensation for damages resulting from violations of social and human rights factors                                                                                                           | 0 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labour force itself                                                                                                                                      | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labour force itself that are cases of non-compliance with the<br>United Nations Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises | 0 |\n| Amount of material fines, sanctions and compensation for serious human rights problems and incidents                                                                                                                          | 0 |\n| Number of incidents of discrimination                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights problems and incidents related to the labor force itself that are cases of non-compliance with the<br>United Nations Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises  | 0 |\n| Number of serious human rights cases in which the company played a role in obtaining redress for those affected                                                                                                               | 0 |\n\n## **4. Internal and external channels**\n\nCommunication mechanisms are a key element in improving internal processes and procedures. Renta 4 has, among others, the following channels:\n\n· Customer Service: Responsible for handling all complaints and claims that customers may submit related to their legally recognised interests or rights.\n\n· Complaints channel: Renta 4 has a reporting channel available to both employees and interest groups (customers, suppliers, administration, volunteers, professionals in the framework of an employment or statutory relationship already completed, family or any other third party). This channel, which allows anonymous communication, is available electronically, by telephone, by post and in person.\n\n· Exercise of the rights associated with the protection of personal data: In compliance with the data protection regulations, Renta 4 offers to interested parties a channel for the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, opposition, portability, deletion, limitation to processing, withdrawal of consent and not to be subject to automated decisions.\n\n#### **Table of Relevant Data on the Information Received Through the Channels**\n\n| Complaints channel: Number of complaints received                                               | 0  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Number of rights associated with the protection of personal data                                | 50 |\n| Number of complaints filed through channels for people in their own workforce to raise concerns | 0  |\n| Number of complaints filed with OECD National Contact Points for Multinational Enterprises      | 0  |\n| Number of complaints filed with OECD National Contact Points for Multinational Enterprises      | 0  |\n\n# Corruption and bribery\n\nRenta 4's Code of Conduct, the highest level of internal rules, establishes the following among its five general principles of conduct:\n\n'No employee of the Entity shall offer, pay, request any payment, gift, promise or compensation with the purpose of obtaining favourable treatment in the commercial activity or in the decision-making process. Likewise, Group employees shall refrain from accepting gifts, hospitality or any type of compensation offered by other Group employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties, intermediaries or any third party with whom they have a relationship. For such purposes, payment, gift, promise or compensation shall be understood as anything given that exceeds the usual, social and courtesy practices, favours or services that imply privilege or unjustified advantage to natural persons or entities or that may condition the performance of functions. Renta 4 Group's employees shall not make donations on behalf of it or for its account, either directly or indirectly, to political parties or contribute in any way to their financing'.\n\nBeing considered one of the five most important for Renta 4, this behavioural guideline is intended to reflect that the entity's mission and objectives shall only be considered achieved within a framework of transparency and zero tolerance for corrupt practices.\n\nLikewise, the following are included as general principles of conduct for all employees: (i) faithful accounting of transactions and their adequate reflection in the financial information published by Renta 4 and (ii) refraining from any action that compromises the entity's reputation, by carrying out unlawful practices when participating in public tenders.\n\nRegarding the guidelines for dealing with the competent authorities and official bodies, the Renta 4 Group has established the following basic principles:\n\n· For the exchange of information, the following premises, shall be taken into account, among others: (i) communications shall observe institutional respect and be developed under criteria of maximum collaboration and compliance with the Law; (ii) requests shall be processed with diligence; (iii) the delivery, promise or offer of any kind of payment, fee, gift or compensation to any authorities, public officials or employees or managers of companies or public bodies in Spain or any other country, whether made directly to them or indirectly through persons or companies related to them and whether it is addressed to the public official or the employee themselves or to another person indicated by them, shall be forbidden.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n· Regarding tax obligations: (i) practices that imply illegally avoiding the payment of taxes to the detriment of the Treasury shall be avoided and (ii) professional activities in countries or territories classified as tax havens in accordance with the Spanish legislation, if ever developed, shall be identified and defined.\n\nIn this sense, Renta 4 has, among others, the following measures:\n\n· The Internal Rules of Conduct (already described in the section on Human Rights). Revised and updated throughout 2023, this internal standard is intended to serve as a guide for managing conflicts of interest, as well as establishing guidelines for employee behaviour in the securities market.\n\n· The model of organisation and control for the prevention of criminal risks: During 2023, with regard to corruption and bribery, the following crimes were updated:\n\n- Business corruption, defined in article 286 bis of the Criminal Code: The following have been identified as sensitive and prohibited activities: (i) Contracting and commercial relations with customers, suppliers and other individuals; (ii) Accept or offer an unjustified benefit or advantage on behalf of Renta 4 entities as consideration to unduly favour another.\n\n- The associated controls, in addition to those of a general nature, are: The Incentive Policy, updated in 2023 and the Remuneration Policy for Directors.\n\n- The offence of bribery under article 424 of the Criminal Code: Sensitive and prohibited activities have been identified: (i) Relations in general with the Public Administration; (ii) Relations in general with foreign administrations; (ii) Management of administrative inspections (regulatory, tax, social security, working conditions, etc.); (iii) Management of gifts and donations to public authorities or officials; (iv) Management of public funds on deposit or (v) deposit of securities or other assets seized by public authority.\n\n- To mitigate risks, the following specific mitigating controls are available: Policy on the prohibition of offering/accepting gifts expressly provided for in the Code of Conduct; procedure for justifying corporate expenses; disposition limits and authorisation levels for expenses incurred from Renta 4 Group funds: Publication of financial information; Audit of accounts.\n\n- Offences against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism regulated by article 301 of the Criminal Code. As sensitive or prohibited activities have been identified all those marked as such in the current regulations. Specific controls mitigating the risk of committing these crimes are: (i) the Internal Manual on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing; (ii) the internal structure for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, articulated in three levels; (iii) the Committee on the Prevention of Money Laundering; (iv) the Operational Unit for the Prevention of Money Laundering (UOPBC); (v) the Representative to SEPBLAC; (vi) the Customer Knowledge and Admission Policy; (vii) the Risk Stratification Policy; (viii) the procedure for controlling the actions of agents; (ix) the procedure for controlling movements of cash means of payment; (x) the reporting procedure; (xi) the checklist verification process; (xii) the money laundering and terrorist financing risk self-assessment report; (xiii) the annual internal audit; (xiv) the annual report of the UOPBC; (xiv) annual review by external expert and (xv) the control procedure of subsidiaries in third countries.\n\n· Outsourcing policy: although this internal regulation has already been described in the section on Human Rights, it is mentioned in this section in order to indicate that, in the process of approving third parties, aspects such as the following are taken into account: (i) whether the supplier has a criminal risk prevention model; (ii) whether it has a Corporate Responsibility Policy or (iii) whether its principles and values are in line with Renta 4's Code of Conduct.\n\n## **1. Training and information**\n\nRenta 4 has adopted the necessary measures to ensure that employees are aware of the internal policies, procedures and controls established in the Anti-Money Laundering & Countering Financing of Terrorism Manual.\n\nConsequently, Renta 4's employees must know and put into practice the prevention measures contemplated by internal regulations and examine those transactions which, due to their nature or the circumstances and characteristics of the clients, present indications of possible links with money laundering or terrorist financing activities, in order to adopt the additional prevention and communication measures defined from time to time. To this end, the Manual is always accessible and updated on the intranet.\n\nWith this objective, training has also been implemented, in which knowledge of financial sanctions has been reinforced, with a view to understanding the obligations to which the Group is subject. In 2023, this training has been directed as a priority to all employees of the Management of Collective Investment Institutions (CII) and Plans, as well as to foreign subsidiaries. In addition, it has been extended to new employees from all areas who joined after the last training session. This comprehensive approach reflects the organisation's commitment to continuously updating its teams, ensuring that all employees, both existing and new arrivals, are properly trained in best practices to know financial sanctions obligations. This initiative not only strengthens internal security, but also strengthens the company's position in promoting ethical and legal conduct at all levels of operation.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the training of Prevention and Detection of Corruption or Bribery, to indicate that the training provided in the field of money laundering prevention provided content related to the detection of crimes related to corruption and bribery, under the lens of the prevention of laundering. The training session was launched at the end of December and has remained active until the end of January 2024, as of 31/12/2024, 46% of the employees convened had been trained.\n\n#### **Main Indicators of this Activity in 2023**\n\n| Number of pending court proceedings due to arrears                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Number of confirmed incidents related to contracts with business partners that were terminated or not renewed due to corruption or bribery-related violations |\n| Number of convictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws                                                                                  |\n\n| Number of pending court proceedings due to arrears                                                                                                               | 0 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|\n| Number of confirmed incidents related to contracts with business partners that were terminated or not<br>renewed due to corruption or bribery-related violations | 0 |\n| Number of convictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws                                                                                     | 0 |\n\n#### **2. Measures to prevent money laundering**\n\nThe risk of financial crime originates from the actions or the use of means, products and services of Renta 4 in activities of a criminal or illegal nature. These activities include, inter alia, money laundering, terrorist financing, violation of international sanctions programmes, corruption, bribery and tax evasion. Given the universal and globalised nature of financial crimes, which take advantage of the international economy, their detection, deterrence and disruption require a coordinated response from both the international community and the financial sector.\n\nIn this context Renta 4 recognises the significance of this problem and the important role that financial institutions and other economic agents play in its prevention. Consequently, measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism are based on three fundamental pillars: The adoption of the highest international standards, their adequacy and compliance through global policies, and the implementation of technological systems that enable such compliance. Renta 4 constantly strives to improve its control framework and maintains an uncompromising stance on non-compliance with financial crime regulations, both internationally and in the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe Renta 4 commitment is reflected by the establishment of mandatory rules and procedures, to ensure strict compliance with current regulations in relation to the prevention of money laundering. In addition, Renta 4 commits to follow the recommendations and guidelines issued by international bodies such as the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Banking Authority (EBA), as well as relevant national and international authorities. These manuals comprehensively detail the internal control measures implemented by Renta 4, providing detailed information on policies related to due diligence, information management, document preservation, assessment and management of laundering risks, and the management of the risks of the company. communication and admission of customers and continuous monitoring of the business relationship.\n\nThese policies are kept updated and based on a prior risk analysis, a practical report adapted to the reality of the activity of Renta 4, which acts as an x-ray of the business from the perspective of anti-money laundering. Using this approach, Renta 4 identifies the potential risks of someone taking advantage of the activity carried out by the entity introduce, move or hide funds of suspicious origin. In order to mitigate these risks, group entities are classified, designing and implementing specific measures and controls. In addition, a specific risk analysis is performed and documented before the launch of a new product, the provision of a new service or a new distribution channel or the use of a new technology. This involves the implementation of appropriate measures to manage risk. Similarly, a risk analysis is carried out on the customer's own characteristics, classifying them into risk levels with the aim of designing and implementing measures and controls to mitigate risk.\n\nThe risk management model of money-laundering and terrorist financing prevention is under constant independent review. This evaluation is complemented by internal and external audits. In accordance with Spanish regulations, an external expert annually carries out a review of the money laundering and terrorist financing prevention programme implemented in Spain. For this reason, work has continued on the Action\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nPlan approved for the exercise in compliance with the recommendations issued by the external expert and the Supervisor in the field, as well as strengthening the process of updating the proceedings, no significant deficiencies were identified.\n\nThe organisational structure that Renta 4 has established for Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism includes:\n\n· An Internal Control Body, through the creation of the Committee for the Prevention of Money Laundering, a centralised body at the group level. This committee plays a crucial role in meeting monthly to address issues related to the prevention of money-laundering. One of its distinctive features is its composition, which includes representatives from all business areas, thus providing a deep understanding of the Renta 4 operating environment. This comprehensive approach ensures a unanimous commitment to the implementation of money laundering prevention regulations and ensures sustained effectiveness in the management of associated risks. The constant interaction and collaboration between the various departments, facilitated by the presence of their representatives on the committee, strengthens organisational cohesion and reinforces our commitment to the highest ethical and legal standards in all facets of our operations.\n\n· An Anti-Money Laundering Technical Unit, centralised at Group level, with specialised staff, exclusive dedication and appropriate training in analysis. The main objective of this unit is to define and supervise the processes within the business, as well as to ensure compliance with the policy for the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\n· A representative before the SEPBLAC in charge of administration and appointed in turn by the Board of Directors, who is ultimately responsible for compliance with the reporting obligations established in Law 10/2010, of 28 April.\n\nIn the exercise of its management function and in line with its commitment to the fight against moneylaundering and the financing of terrorism, the administrative body has designated one of its members as responsible for this matter. This designated, with sufficient knowledge and experience, stands as the main point of contact between the *Compliance Officer* and the management body. Distinguishing itself in this way by its firm commitment to the highest standards of regulatory compliance in the field of prevention. Proactively, it adapts quickly to the commitments made, demonstrating a continuous ability to quickly adjust to the new requirements set by the guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA). This flexibility and promptness in responding to emerging regulations not only reflect the entity's commitment to integrity and transparency, but also underscore its diligent approach to the constant evolution of regulatory frameworks. The agile adaptation to the EBA guidelines ensures that the entity not only meets current requirements, but also proactively anticipates future regulatory demands, thus strengthening its position as a committed and compliant actor in the financial field.\n\nThis organisational structure stands as an essential pillar to effectively manage the risk of regulatory noncompliance, which carries a relevant reputational risk. Said risk has the potential to have a significant negative impact on customer relationships, markets, employees and authorities. Specifically, non-compliance can trigger sanctions, cause damage or result in the cancellation of contracts, with detrimental consequences for the image projected by the entity.\n\nAs a financial group with subsidiaries in various jurisdictions, Renta 4 persists in implementing a uniform Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Compliance Model (PBC/FT) in all the countries in which it operates. This effort results in the reinforcement of *reporting obligations* to the matrix, with the aim of obtaining relevant information with greater regularity and detail. Special attention is paid to critical areas, such as the detection of suspicious transactions, high-risk customer discharges, coincidences with lists of persons with public responsibility (PRP). Also, during 2023, controls in these countries have been strengthened, especially in the area of sanctions filtering, homogenising policy and lists to consult. This model adapts to the local regulations of the jurisdictions in which Renta 4 is present, incorporating the best practices of the international financial industry and the recommendations of international organisations such as the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nIn the course of 2023, a new approach to the administration of the tools for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (PBC&FT) has also been launched, in order to enhance the efficiency of these processes and strengthen the analytical and research capabilities. As a result of these efforts, Renta 4 has resolved a significant number of investigation files, culminating in the submission of multiple suspicious transaction communications to the relevant authorities.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 has implemented an annual training plan on Prevention of Money Laundering (PBC) and Terrorist Financing (FT) for its employees, with the aim of raising awareness on this crucial matter. This training programme includes various actions, such as e-learning courses and videos, designed for both new entrants and established employees.\n\nWithin this plan, each training action is specifically adapted to the group to which it is directed. This ranges from general concepts derived from the regulation applicable in PBC/FT, both internal and external, to specific issues affecting the functions performed by each group. During 2023, a comprehensive training initiative on the Prevention of Money Laundering was carried out, divided into two sessions with specific contents and adapted to the different needs of the employees called.\n\nIn the first instance, a general training session was held for bank employees and subsidiaries abroad, addressing fundamental concepts and regulatory updates. Simultaneously, a second specific session was held for the Manager of Collective Investment Institutions (CII) and Plans. It highlights the achievement of completing 48% of general training and 36% of specific training for managers to date, evidencing a solid progress in the training of the employees called.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the training was launched at the end of December and has been active until the end of January 2024, underlining our continued commitment to updating and strengthening knowledge on the prevention of money laundering in all areas of the organisation.\n\nIn addition, interactive methodology, continuous evaluation, digital resources, interdepartmental collaboration and continuous feedback are key elements that enrich the training experience, promoting participation, self-directed learning and constant improvement in the implementation of prevention policies. In short, training goes beyond the mere transmission of information, seeking to create an interactive learning environment that adapts to the specific needs of the organisation, fosters collaboration and promotes a culture of continuous prevention.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nRenta 4 believes that both sustainability risk and reputational risk would be mitigated by establishing policies and procedures with a view to Corporate Social Responsibility, with a vocation for permanence and a commitment to the highest level of business management, as well as shared value with the citizens in its sphere of action. The objective pursued with the appropriate management of these risks is to generate profit in a responsible manner, considering sustainable investment as one of the main levers for the progress of the entities and of society.\n\nTo achieve this aim, Renta 4 works to raise awareness and implement incremental measures in this area, by issuing a series of annual policies and reports to inform its stakeholders about the measures to manage and reduce these non-financial risks. These include:\n\n· The establishment of an internal committee or ESG Committee was set up last year, which is responsible for supervising the reporting process and internal control systems in ESG matters, and for submitting the information in this respect to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n· The preparation of the Group's ESG policy, which establishes sustainability as a priority, integrating ESG aspects into its business strategy and corporate culture. On the other hand, publishing in turn ESG policy for Renta 4 Gestora, ESG policy of asset management\n\n· The preparation and disclosure of PIAs or principal adverse impacts both at the level of marketer (Renta 4 Banco) and manager (Renta 4 Gestora), which will be updated periodically according to the evolution of the regulations.\n\n· The publication of an information statement on non-financial risks, which is included in the annual report and which sets out the measures adopted and their annual improvement in accordance with the development of best practices and regulations.\n\n· Additionally, the Group adapts to the ESG Taxonomy Regulation in accordance with regulatory requirements and deadlines by establishing the 'ESG Taxonomy Exposure Eligibility Assessment Procedure' in which both internal and external tools (Clarity AI) are used to report compliance with the eligibility of exposures under the taxonomy in the Statement of Non-Financial Information.\n\n# <span id=\"page-172-0\"></span>Company\n\n· It should be noted that in 2022 Renta 4 Banco began the inclusion of the ESG Risk framework in its Risk Appetite Framework. Internally, policies and procedures are prepared ad reviewed that identify, regulate and mitigate these ESG risks, although they are not a priori material.\n\n· Alignment with international public objectives through the accession of Renta 4 as a group, since January 2023, to the Principles of Responsible Investment of the Unity Nations,\n\n· Finally, it should be noted that Renta 4 Banco joined the NZBA commitment in January 2023. A methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of the Renta 4 Group has been developed in accordance with the GHG Protocol and progress is being made toward the first target set for neutrality in operational GHG emissions by the end of 2025.\n\nThe group continues the process of implementing the different regulations and updating regulations for implementing and disclosing information related to sustainability in the financial services sector, starting in past years and with the help of external experts to evolve and adapt adequately the policies, procedures and measures for the analysis of the current situation of the group with respect to what is required on the integration of ESG risks.\n\n#### **1. Contributions to industry associations**\n\nRenta 4 establishes alliances with associations from different sectors in the communities where it operates, relying on them to identify and try to respond to the needs of the local environment. The total contribution of Renta 4 to non-for-profit sector associations in 2023 amounted to €139,068.20.\n\nThese include the partnership with UNPRI, in line with the entity's commitment to the implementation of responsible investment policies, and NZBA, which joins forces with the banking industry to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission neutrality.\n\nRenta 4 Gestora SGIIC SA and Renta 4 Pensiones SGFP SA are ordinary members of INVERCO, the\n\nAssociation of Collective Investment Institutions and Pension Funds, the Spanish umbrella organisation for collective investment schemes. Its members are Spanish entities that manage investment funds and pension plans, as well as foreign entities that are duly registered and controlled by the Spanish Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The instalments paid in 2023 were 15,000 euros and 25,000 euros respectively.\n\n#### **2. Information on partnership or sponsorship activities**\n\nIn the solidarity field, the Group's activities are mainly channelled through donations made to various associations. In particular, during the year 2023 Renta 4 has donated a total of €167,475 distributed as detailed in the following table:\n\n|  | Association                                   | Amount (€) |\n|--|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n|  | Renta 4 Foundation                            | 99,000     |\n|  | Donation Techo Foundation Constitution        | 2,308      |\n|  | Sports Club Cycle Tourist                     | 45         |\n|  | Royal Theatre Foundation                      | 64,377     |\n|  | Assoc. of entrepreneurs of the Costa Tropical | 25         |\n|  | Ampao Foundation                              | 600        |\n|  | Cofrad Penit of our Father Jesus Nazareth     | 325        |\n|  | Royal Economic Society Friends of the Country | 360        |\n|  | University of Valladolid                      | 125        |\n|  | Alfonso Sese Tena Foundation                  | 310        |\n|  | Total                                         | 167,475    |\n\nOne of the main solidarity actions is carried out through the activity of the Renta 4 Foundation. Today, Renta 4 Banco represents 100% of the contributions received by the Renta 4 Foundation to carry out its activities. In 2023, this contribution was €99,000,00.\n\nThe Renta 4 Foundation donates annually to projects that promote education in the most vulnerable populations of Spain, Africa, and Latin America in order to ensure that high quality education reaches the greatest number of young people following transparency values.\n\nThe Renta 4 Foundation involves the Group's employees in the project proposals and associations that can participate in the selection process. The foundation's board of trustees analyses every proposed project/association and checks whether they meet the established requirements. Then, some projects and associations are validated and all employees vote to choose the ones with the most votes.\n\nCurrently, the foundation makes annual contributions of €6,000 euros to 14 projects. These assignments are revalidated on an annual basis, although 7 of them already have a continuity commitment, given the path shared with the projects developed in them.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Table of Details of the Contributions Made by the Renta 4 Foundation to Solidarity Associations**\n\n| Item                                                       | Amount (€) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| By employee vote                                           |            |\n| Montemadrid Foundation                                     | 6,000      |\n| Love without Barriers Foundation                           | 6,000      |\n| Juan Dreamador Foundation                                  | 6,000      |\n| Foundation Love without Barriers                           | 6,000      |\n| Ramon Rey Ardid Foundation                                 | 6,000      |\n| Carpio Perez Association                                   | 6,000      |\n| Senara Foundation                                          | 6,000      |\n| By direct assignment of the Foundation's board of trustees |            |\n| Canary Martinez Foundation                                 | 5,000      |\n| Water of Coconut Foundation                                | 6,000      |\n| Prodis Foundation                                          | 6,000      |\n| Agh Foundation                                             | 6,700      |\n| Procivism Foundation                                       | 10,000     |\n| Sustainable Development Foundation ADF                     | 6,000      |\n| Granadown Foundation                                       | 6,000      |\n| Total                                                      | 87.700     |\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 participates directly in solidarity actions, ensuring that they are always within the area of action that the Group has set itself: education and culture as vehicles for the development of society and people, with a special focus on social inclusion and the development of the most disadvantaged groups. Among these actions there are examples such as sponsorship of the Teatro Real (€64,377) or sponsorship of a flat for the reintegration of mentally disabled persons from the Techo Foundation (€2,308).\n\n#### **3. Company commitment to sustainable development through training society**\n\nDue to Renta 4's activity as a bank specialised in capital markets, an activity of a global nature and with a wide technological scope, the impact on suppliers and employment is usually broad.\n\nIn addition to the effects described above, the activity of Renta 4 consists in democratising intermediation and asset management, which has a positive effect on the financial situation, providing a value-added service with impact on the citizens' finances and savings. The dissemination and pedagogical work is a commitment that is embraced across the entire organisation, both in the branches and at headquarters.\n\nThese training and information events take place both in a framework of proximity, from the conference rooms available to each of the offices of the network, and in a national framework as face-to-face and online events, from the auditorium that has the headquarters.\n\n#### **Conferences from the Office Network**\n\nIn 2023, 106 training and information courses on the different investment products were organised from the network of offices, 13.1% less than in 2022, but this concentration has better selected the topics and mobilised more registrations reaching 3,740, increasing these by 4.3% to the previous year. The average number of participants per course or seminar has increased from 29.4 to 35.3, an increase of 205.\n\n| Office courses                | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | %      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Total courses completed       | 102   | 122   | 106   | -13.1% |\n| Total enrolments              | 3,902 | 3,586 | 3,740 | 4.3%   |\n| Average enrolments per course | 38.3  | 29.4  | 35.3  | 20.0%  |\n\n#### **Conferences from the Headquarters**\n\nIn the form of webinar and face-to-face, from the auditorium of the headquarters, 41 training and information events have been held, which represents 10.6% more than in 2020. These events have reached 13,217 registered, 20.8% less than in the previous year. This fall in attendance has been offset by the very high growth in the visualisations of the \"on demand\" events that amounts to 100.55 accumulating a total of 57,640 views. That is, events in webinar format are consuming a lot in deferred. The user is getting used to choosing the time he prefers to play it.\n\n| Webinars                      | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | %      |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total courses completed       | 24     | 37     | 41     | 10.8%  |\n| Total enrolments              | 7,814  | 16,691 | 13,217 | -20.8% |\n| Average enrolments per course | 325.6  | 451.1  | 322.4  | -28.5% |\n| Total views on demand         | 29,153 | 28,755 | 57,640 | 100.5% |\n\nOne of the training conferences with the greatest participation was the \"Saver to Investor Cycle\" that proposes conferences that go through the fundamentals of investment, funds, fixed income or the importance of financial planning, as well as financial planning. that begins in early October coinciding with the Day of Financial Education, and that accumulates 6,440 visualisations. The event with most total views.\n\nAnother cycle with great educational value is the \"Invest in IT cycle\", an open cycle that invites users to obtain profitability in their personal development, with lectures on culture, education, life experiences. This cycle has accumulated 12,975 views in 2023, almost 25% of the total.\n\nIn addition to conferences, multiple pieces of content are produced and disseminated throughout the year around the theme of sustainability in the form of blog posts, video shorts, conferences, webinars and courses...\n\n# **4. Description of the relationships maintained with local communities**\n\nRenta 4's activities and events are advertised through the web, social networks, and local media (radio, newspapers, etc). Special emphasis is placed on offering specialised information in collaborative formats through local newspapers and radio stations.\n\nThe establishment of Renta 4 in the country through its wide network of offices in all provincial capitals generates an economic impact on employment and the outsourcing of suppliers for maintenance and several other service activities to sustain the branches that function locally.\n\nRenta 4 is a national benchmark in investment services and capital markets. Its presence throughout Spain, in every provincial capital, is proof of its commitment to society as a whole to democratise investment, based on the belief that investment is one of the main engines for improving people's lives.\n\nIn addition, Renta 4 Banco has continued to work throughout 2023 to integrate information and operational tools that allow investors to carry out their investment activity considering sustainability factors in an increasingly detailed way. The purpose is to enter data and elements to filter and select the assets and agents that fit their SRI criteria.\n\nThe Corporate activity of Renta 4 includes the analysis and access to financing for small companies to support their growth and eventual IPO. This activity is combined with local offices to offer SMEs these possibilities, so we consider that it has a very positive impact on local areas.\n\nThe entity participates in the initiative for financial pedagogical education for young people \"Your Finance, Your Future\" promoted by the Spanish Association of Banking, in which employees volunteer in colleges or institutes nationwide giving \n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial training to students between 15 and 17 years old. Renta 4 has been actively collaborating in this initiative since its inception and in 2024, will continue to collaborate.\n\nRenta 4 is a member of the Madrid Futuro programme, to work together with many other companies that want to collaborate in generating impact changes, to guarantee a better future for this society.\n\nIn addition, a large number of training activities on financial matters are carried out in order to bring these aspects of financial literacy closer to local citizens, as described above.\n\n#### **5. Outsourcing of suppliers**\n\nRenta 4 is firmly committed to carrying out supplier selection, outsourcing and sub-contracting activities following the principles of contribution to society and its sustainability. To this end, the supplier selection process takes into account the terms of financial due diligence, a number of internal policies and adaptability to future service needs.\n\nTo this end, a policy and procedure for outsourcing services and functions has been drawn up, which contemplates the set of analysis, monitoring and review activities to be carried out in order to ensure that the third parties contracted comply with the minimum conditions and requirements demanded to achieve adequate mitigation of the inherent risks associated with the function or activity to be performed by the third party.\n\nIn addition to the policy, it has developed a methodology on how to proceed with third parties in each of the phases of their life cycle (contracting, provision and end of service). Complementing the methodology, a tool has been defined for the evaluation of outsourcing, which allows an assessment to be made of the inherent risks associated with the services to be outsourced and to evaluate the suitability of the supplier from the point of view of risk minimisation, taking into account environmental, social and human rights protection criteria.\n\n## **The Three Pillars of the Procedure for Assessing the Inherent Risks Associated with Outsourcing Services**\n\n#### **1. Commitment to Prepare Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\nThe selection of suppliers is carried out using established procedures to mitigate the aforementioned risks and to have measures in place to control them, these procedures being dynamic, thus allowing them to be adapted to possible changes that may occur over time.\n\nThe procedures are grouped in the RFP (Request For Proposal)document, in which the requirements associated with the product or services are included, in order to have an objective reference as to the suitability of the suppliers assessed.\n\n#### **2. Transversal Impact Analysis**\n\nThe selection of suppliers is always based on a transversal analysis of the various Renta 4 areas, represented in three functional verticals:\n\n#### · Technology (security area)\n\n· Business (Marketing, Digital Development, others)\n\n· Compliance (Compliance, Risks, Continuity, Privacy, others)\n\nThese analyses are carried out by people responsible for each project or area, depending on how the activity is performed at any given time and through the corresponding meetings and reports, and they are supervised individually by the Management.\n\n#### **3. Internal Committees:**\n\n1. Security Committee\n\nThis is the body that evaluates recently developed projects or the continuity of activities from an information security point of view, related to how they are executed and what suppliers are engaged in it. It is one of the elements that guarantee compliance with the above-mentioned principles and the application of defined procedures.\n\n2. Suppliers Committee\n\nThis is the body in charge of managing suppliers' IT risks, handling their approval and review, in coordination with the areas involved depending on the supplier or service.\n\n3. ESG Committee\n\nThis is the body that approves the procedures related to ESG or similar matters, and that shall adopt decisions related to their possible noncompliance by third parties.\n\n# **5.1. Description of supplier monitoring and audit systems**\n\nThe correct development of Renta 4's activities through its processes depends, to a large extent, on the suppliers involved. The correct management of these directly affects operations, projects and,\n\nultimately, both the non-financial and financial impact on society. A significant percentage of Renta 4's activities are carried out by outsourcing services to suppliers, as reflected in the percentage of expenditure and investment they represent.\n\nThe main risks affecting the organisation in terms of engagement with sub-contractors and suppliers are organised in two main blocks: IT risks (related to Information Technology) and non-IT risks.\n\n#### **IT Risks**\n\nFirstly, with regard to the **main IT risks**, the following three main areas with possible risk implications are distinguished and listed together with the potential impact that could result from them:\n\n· Privacy: inadequate management of personal data by its suppliers whose data controller is Renta 4 could lead to claims and even significant sanctions from the AEPD, mainly derived from the possibility of non-compliance with current data protection regulations, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in addition to the potential reputational impact derived from this.\n\n· Continuity: risks arising from inadequate management of processes related to the Group's operational resilience and effective incident management, the impact of which may be accentuated if there is no adequate framework for action agreed with suppliers/sub-contractors.\n\n· IT security: risks of security incidents or breaches arising from the implementation of an incorrect selection of security measures associated with the provision of the different services.\n\n#### **Non-IT Risks**\n\nOn the other hand, the main **non-IT risks** to which the organisation could be exposed are set out below:\n\n· Quality and compliance risks: are those that arise in relation to the possibility that the supplier does not comply with the quality levels required by Renta 4, as well as the different SLAs established.\n\n· Reputational risks: arising from the possibility of the supplier being involved in bad practices or illegal activities, as well as regulatory breaches which, due to being in the public domain, affect Renta 4's brand image.\n\n· Financial risks: these are the risks that arise in the event that the relationship with the supplier generates a financial impact on the group that is not aligned with the service or product contracted, either due to incorrect compliance resulting from insolvency or due to the supplier's liquidity problems.\n\n· Operational risks: resulting from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, personnel and systems, or from external events. In particular, errors by information and pricing providers, or intrusions into technological systems that could jeopardise the security of the Group's infrastructure.\n\n· Sustainability or ESG risks: include, as a nonfinancial risk, the losses associated with poor performance, or the lack of sufficient measures to achieve better environmental protection, social development with cohesion criteria and economic growth that generates equitable wealth under appropriate internal governance of the company.\n\n# **5.2. Description of supplier monitoring and audit systems**\n\nAlthough Renta 4 does not have specific supervision systems or audits in environmental matters due to the low level of materialisation of this impact on the Group's financial activity, suppliers are periodically supervised and audited both by the various areas on a discretionary basis, and in accordance with Renta 4's transversal supervision systems. Given the growing importance of monitoring the security of suppliers, an outsourcing policy has been formalized that includes , a review and approval of suppliers prior to contracting, taking into account issues such as, inter alia, certifications, security, continuity, data protection, cloud resources, human resources,\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nhuman rights, equality, etc. In this regard, the approval of suppliers is reviewed periodically, preferably annually, taking into account human rights and sustainability criteria, and being able to certify or audit compliance with them.\n\nMoreover, a series of audits of the third-party risk management process have been carried out in accordance with the previously defined audit plan. As a result of these audit efforts, several points for improvement have been identified and action plans have been defined to remedy them.\n\nWith regard to the protection of customer assets, Renta 4's own processes and those of third-party suppliers are audited by external auditors on an annual basis, in order to demonstrate the correct safeguarding and protection of customer funds and assets. Furthermore, in accordance with regulations, Renta 4 has a person responsible for the asset protection function, who is responsible for monitoring the activity of third parties.\n\nThe main supplier supervision systems identified are the project or activity committees, which involve several areas and are ultimately overseen by the General Management, and other formally established committees, including the Security Committee, the Supplier Committee and the ESG Committee.\n\n#### **6. Consumers**\n\nThe Renta 4 Group is an company specialised in the provision of investment services and high-quality asset management, whose principles are based on proximity to clients and specialisation, offering a wide range of products and high-quality advice for client satisfaction, one of the main purposes of Renta 4.\n\nIn accordance with Order ECO/734/2004, dated March 11, on the client departments and services of financial institutions, the Client Service Department of Renta 4, (hereinafter, CSD) has the **main function of processing and solving the complaints and claims submitted by clients.** To this end, Renta 4 has set up different channels for the effective submission of complaints and/or claims:\n\n- · Email: defensor@renta4.es\n- · Renta 4 website https://www.r4.com/ through the customer's logged-in account (with digital certificate)\n- · Postal address: Paseo de la Habana nº 74, 28036, Madrid\n- · In person at any of Renta 4's offices\n\n· customers or users can also make complaints to the Consumer Affairs offices of their Town Council or Autonomous Community.\n\nComplaints received through any of the channels mentioned are sent to the CSD to first determine whether or not they are to be processed. Then, once they have been accepted, we proceed to the study and detailed analysis of each of the issues raised, reviewing the procedures established by Renta 4 and finally issuing the corresponding resolution, or urging the parties to reach an agreement on the disputes raised.\n\nThe evolution in the number of claims submitted, admitted and processed by the CSD is shown below, classified by the type of resolution issued.\n\n#### **Evolution of Complaints Submitted to the Ccs - Classification by Type Of Resolution**\n\n|                                                  | 2023 |     | 2022 |     | 2021 |     | 2020 |     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|\n| Classification by type of resolution             | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   | Nº   | %   |\n| Against the customer                             | 11   | 37% | 19   | 49% | 23   | 61% | 15   | 34% |\n| In favour of the customer                        | 6    | 20% | 3    | 8%  | 4    | 11% | 5    | 11% |\n| Proposal for a compromise of the SAC (Agreement) | 8    | 27% | 13   | 34% | 6    | 16% | 15   | 34% |\n| Withdrawal of the customer                       | 3    | 10% | 1    | 3%  | 3    | 8%  | 1    | 2%  |\n| Not admitted to processing / suspension          | 0    | 0%  | 1    | 2%  | -    | -   | 1    | 2%  |\n| Pending resolution                               | 2    | 6%  | 2    | 5%  | 2    | 5%  | 7    | 16% |\n| TOTAL                                            | 30   |     | 39   |     | 38   |     | 44   |     |\n\nIn addition, it is reported that the Ombudsman has managed nine cases during 2023. Six have been resolved against the customer, two have been resolved in favour of the customer and one is pending processing.\n\n#### **7.

Renta 4 Gestora has been a member of UNPRI since 2021.\n\n#### **System of Government**\n\nRenta 4 is committed to complying with the various regulations that have emerged in the field of sustainability. To this end, Renta 4 has carried out the following actions:\n\n- · Assigning ESG functions to employees. In the different strategic areas of the entity to assume their responsibilities for defining and implementing policies and procedures.\n- · Establishment of an ESG committee.

Renta 4 is in the process of integrating ESG and sustainable risk criteria for services offered to the public, such as portfolio management and advisory services, in which they are asked about their preferences for sustainable investment.\n\n## **From the Perspective of Renta 4 Gestora as Creator of Financial Products,**\n\nThrough materiality maps, provided by external suppliers, the criteria that are most relevant in each of the sectors are analysed. These analyses are complemented by a dialogue between managers and analysts with the companies in which they invest. 100% of the funds managed by Renta 4 integrate the ESG criteria.\n\n#### **Regulatory Compliance**\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, Renta 4 has worked to comply with the following regulatory requirements as the different milestones set by regulatory bodies were reached.\n\n· Sustainability Annexes: Required by the CNMV to the managers for each fund that promotes or aims for sustainable investments.\n\n· Calculation of the carbon footprint: A methodology has been established for the calculation of the carbon footprint (scopes 1, 2 and 3) according to the GHG Protocol.

SDG 1 – Provide quality education**\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/32 description: The image shows a close-up of a graphic element. The text \"EDUCACIÓN DE CALIDAD\" is visible at the top, written in a sans-serif font and a light brown color. Below the text is a simple line drawing of a pencil, also in a light brown color. The background is a light beige or cream color.\n\nOne of the objectives of sustainable development to which the entity has committed itself is to provide quality education. Renta 4 has been committed to this goal for many years,\n\nconvinced that there are two levers that favour the progress of society and people:\n\n· one is investment, capital markets, as sources of financing for private companies to develop and thrive, and when the business fabric progresses, societies progress\n\n· the other is education, training and preparation of people from the most fundamental levels of education to the most advanced and specialised.\n\nRenta 4 wants to create an impact in both dimensions and while one is inherent in its own business activity, the other is acquired as a social commitment.\n\nThus, in 2023 the Board of Directors approved the SDG proposed by the ESG Committee to progressively increase the donation to cultural or educational projects to the most disadvantaged groups to reach 0.7% of net benefits in 2025.\n\n**In 2023, the total amount donated to projects that promote culture or education amounted to 167,475.00 euros, with net profits in the year of 26.6 Mn €. This represents 0.63% of the net profit.**\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. SDG 2 – GHG emission neutrality**\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/3 description: The image shows a logo with the text \"ACCIÓN POR EL CLIMA\" (Climate Action) above a green leaf symbol. The leaf is stylized with a simple outline and a single vertical line representing the stem.\n\nIn its commitment to environmental protection, the Board of Directors of Renta 4 approved the SDG throughout 2023 to achieve operational GHG emission neutrality by 2025.\n\nA model was developed in 2022 to calculate the carbon footprint of Scopes 1 and 2 and of the activities relevant to Renta 4 in Scope 3. The calculation was based on emissions data for the entities that comprise the Renta 4 Group and its controlled operations.\n\nThe methodology implemented in the calculation of Renta 4's carbon footprint is based on:\n\n· GHG Protocol according to the ECCR standard (Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard)\n\n· The indications of the MITECO (Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge)\n\n· The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) guidance: The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry.\n\nEach year, with the results obtained in terms of carbon emissions, a final report is produced with the conclusions and key points, at a high level, and possible actions to be to be taken in an action plan for the following year, in order to encourage the reduction of the footprint.\n\nA more detailed summary on the calculation of the carbon footprint can be found in the environment section of this document.\n\nThe result of the calculation of the operational emissions carbon footprint calculated for 2023 was 1,046.86 of tCO2eq, 4.7% more than in 2022 (999.91 tCO2eq), corresponding to the sum of Scope 1 emissions, 2 and scope 3 operational.\n\nDespite this small growth, the results of the first phase of the SDG for 2023, focusing on those emissions generated by Scope 2, have been very positive. These are described below.\n\n#### **Summary Table of the Variation in the Calculation of the Carbon Footprint Between 2022 and 2023**\n\n| Operational GHG emissions        | Emissions (t CO₂ eq) 2022 | Emissions (t CO₂ eq) 2023 | Change Emissions '22-'23 (%) |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Scope 1                          | 87.02                     | 98.49                     | 13.19%                       |\n| Scope 2                          | 109.76                    | 72.05                     | -34.36%                      |\n| Branches                         | 85.11                     | 28.04                     | -67.05%                      |\n| Head office                      | 13.85                     | 3.95                      | -71.48%                      |\n| Total Spain                      | 98.95                     | 32                        | -67.66%                      |\n| International                    | 10.81                     | 40.06                     | 270.58%                      |\n| Scope 3 operational              | 803.13                    | 854.40                    | 6.38%                        |\n| 1.

This is one of the most satisfactory measures since they seek neutrality not by GHG compensation but directly by the non-emission of CO2.**\n\nThis initiative shows that GHG emissions in Spain have been reduced by 67.66% compared to 2022. In Luxembourg this reduction has been 100% since the change has been made since the beginning of the year. In total, Scope 2 has reduced emissions by 34.36% in 2023.\n\nThis has succeeded in overcoming the first milestone on the decarbonisation route. In 2024, it is planned to launch actions to try to achieve GHG neutrality of full operational scopes 1 and 2, leaving by 2025 the last operational decarbonisation target, generated by Scope 3.\n\n#### **3. SDG 3 – Democratisation of investment**\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/20 description: The image shows a close-up of a poster or document with the words \"REDUCCIÓN DE DESIGUALDADES\" in a bold, sans-serif font. The text is in a warm, brownish-orange color, and it appears to be the title or heading of the document. Below the text, there are two stylized symbols or icons, also in the same brownish-orange color. The background of the poster is a light, creamy color, providing a soft contrast to the text and symbols. The overall impression is that the document is related to the topic of reducing inequalities.\n\nAnother SDG to which Renta 4 has made a firm commitment is to reduce inequalities.\n\nConsequently, with the entity's vision \"PROMOTING INVESTMENT FOR THE PROGRESS OF PEOPLE And SOCIETY\", that is, the belief that investment is a lever of social and individual progress, in Renta 4 it is believed that precisely society and people should be able to access investment without the knowledge, time or size of their savings being an impediment, \"DEMOCRATISING INVESTMENT\".\n\nThis is why, over the course of this year, it has been added among the objectives to have a cumulative impact until 2025, at least 7% of the workforce, with the message that access to investment services and products is available to all.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, an \"INVESTMENT FOR ALL\" campaign has been launched with a media plan on the main social networks with video formats, posts, etc.\n\nRenta 4 @Renta4 27 dic\n\n[#INVERSION PARA TODOS] ¿Ya sabes a qué mercado acudir para empezar a invertir? \n\n¡Dale al play y descúbrelo! ow.ly/PEWRSOQHNG\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/27 description: The image shows a graphic with a stock chart and the text \"El unico mercado que tienes que conocer para empezar a invertir\".\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/28 description: A tweet from Renta 4 that says \"[INVERSIÓN PARA TODOS] Para empezar a invertir sólo necesitas este bono... ¿Sabes cuál es?\"\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/31 description: The image shows a video with a cartoon drawing of a building and a bus.

EU ESG taxonomy**\n\nDelegated Regulation EU 2178/2021 and its subsequent amendment to Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023 in development of Regulation EU 852/2020, specify the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed by financial and non-financial undertakings subject to the reporting obligation of the Non-Financial Reporting Statement (in Avanten SNFI.) in the framework of environmentally sustainable activities.\n\nThis regulatory requirement is based on the ESG taxonomy established in EU Regulation 852/2020. The ESG taxonomy establishes a regulatory framework with the aim of harmonising at European level the consideration of sustainable economic activities in relation to the following climate objectives:\n\n- **1.** Climate change mitigation.\n- **2.** Adaptation to climate change.\n- **3.** Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.\n- **4.** Transition to a circular economy.\n- **5.** Prevention and control of pollution.\n- **6.** Protection and recovery of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe technical criteria for considering that an economic activity contributes substantially to meeting the objectives of mitigation and adaptation to climate change are defined in Delegated Regulation EU 2139/2021 and extended in Delegated Regulation EU 2485/2023. The technical criteria for considering that an economic activity contributes substantially to the fulfilment of each of the other objectives are regulated in Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023. These regulations also specify the criteria to be met by economic activities in order to consider that they do not cause significant harm to each of the climate objectives.\n\n# <span id=\"page-178-0\"></span>Taxonomy\n\nIn this way, the ESG taxonomy establishes the relationship of environmental objectives with the economic activities eligible for each of the climate objectives, and the requirements to evaluate the alignment of the economic activities carried out by companies with the aforementioned objectives\n\nFor these purposes, an economic activity eligible as environmentally sustainable (aligned with the taxonomy) is considered to the extent that it meets the following requirements:\n\n**1.** Contribute substantially to one or more environmental objectives.\n\n**2.** It does not cause significant harm to any of the environmental objectives.\n\n**3.** The minimum guarantees laid down in the regulations are complied with.\n\n**4.** It conforms to the technical criteria established in the regulations.\n\nEach company subject to publication of the SNFI shall assess and disclose to what extent it carries out and is exposed to the economic activities eligible for each of the objectives, and to what extent these activities are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore taxonomy-aligned.\n\nFor the aforementioned evaluation, the nature of the economic activity, its orientation to meet some of the climate objectives, and the impact it implies for the company using the key performance indicators indicated in the aforementioned regulation. In particular, the extent to which activities considered as transitional or facilitative activities are aligned, in accordance with the regulations, shall also be disclosed.\n\nFor these purposes, the Renta 4 Group as a banking group is subject to the preparation and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information, as defined in Annexes V and VI, X of the Delgado EU 2178/2021 Regulation and subsequent developments.\n\nAccording to this regulation, depending on the implementation schedule, and considering the limitations indicated in the \"qualitative information\", credit institutions must measure and evaluate the degree of eligibility and alignment of economic activities (including breakdown of transition and facilitative activities). from eligible counterparties to their operations, in relation to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. To do this, the different key performance indicators defined by the regulations for each type of asset must be taken into account.\n\nThis assessment shall be reflected in the breakdown and calculation of the key performance indicators of credit institutions, generically referred to as Green Asset Ratios (hereinafter referred to as GAR) with respect to the balance sheet exposures in current and flow terms (i.e. new transactions), off-balance sheet exposures, revenue and commissions of certain services and the trading book. The latter two categories are not required until the financial year 2026.\n\nIn order to obtain and process the necessary quantitative and qualitative information, the Renta 4 Group's \"Procedure for assessing the eligibility and alignment of exposures in accordance with the ESG taxonomy\" has been followed. This procedure describes mainly the internal processes for the evaluation of eligibility and alignment of income exposures 4 Banco S.A., both inside and outside the balance sheet.\n\nIn order to comply with this procedure, internal databases have been reviewed, prioritised and updated, and processes have been further automated, allowing for better control and monitoring of these processes. The database has also been enriched by external information providers of recognised prestige in the field.\n\n#### **Quantitative Information**\n\nIn relation to the quantitative information required by the aforementioned regulation, the Renta 4 Group has completed the templates listed in Annex VI, following the instructions set out in Annex V of Delegated Regulation EU 2178/2021, 2021 as well as in subsequent developments, as referred to above\n\nDelegated Regulation EU 2139/2021, Delegated Regulation EU 2485/2023 and Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023,\n\nThe following are templates reflecting quantitative information related to the GARs and key outcome indicators:\n\n# **Template 0: Summary of key Performance Indicators**\n\nThis table includes a summary of key performance indicators described in the following headings, which develop the following data:\n\n· The total of environmentally sustainable assets/ activities broken down climate objectives and globally.\n\n· Results of the GAR considering as key indicators of exposures performance, the turnover indicator and the CAPEX indicator.\n\n· The percentage of hedging for each key profit or loss indicator on the Group's total assets.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Template 1: Assets for the Calculation of the Green Asset Ratio (G.A.R.)**\n\nIn this table, with data relating to the financial year 2023, exposures are classified by accounting sectorisation, type of product, and eligibility in the calculation of the ratio of green assets (G.A.R.). The objective of this calculation is to obtain the amount of eligibility and the actual alignment of exposures, both on and off the balance sheet with respect to the taxonomy for each climate change mitigation and adaptation objective, based, separately, on the basis of the in the key performance indicators of turnover and CAPEX of counterparties to operations.\n\nIt should be noted that the assets covered by the GAR numerator represent 4.34% of the total assets, while the assets excluded from the numerator, and those excluded from the numerator and denominator, represent respectively 22.10% and 73.56%.\n\nLikewise, the degree of alignment with the taxonomy of those exposures to economic activities considered as facilitators or transition is indicated.\n\n#### **Summary of key

and actual alignment (including breakdown of transition and facilitative activities) of the new balance sheet exposures with the taxonomy for each of the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives is indicated, on the total assets covered by the GAR as defined in template 1.\n\nThe degree of alignment with the taxonomy is reported, separately, based on the key indicators of turnover and CAPEX results. For the purposes of these tables, to assess the degree of eligibility and alignment for each of the environmental objectives for mitigation and adaptation to climate change of exposures representing new net lending for the financial year 2023, the proportion they represent on the total eligible new net loans for that year is calculated.\n\nIt should be noted that new assets covered by the GAR numerator represent 7.91% of total new assets, while new assets excluded from the numerator, and those excluded from the numerator and denominator, respectively represent 72.45% and 19.34%.\n\nImage /page/188/Picture/11 description: The image shows a close-up of a white, textured surface. The texture appears to be composed of small, irregular shapes that create a pattern of light and shadow. The overall impression is one of subtle depth and variation in the surface.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **GAR Key Outcomes Indicator in terms of flow based on

           |\n\n#### **Qualitative Information**\n\nThe subjective scope of application of the ESG taxonomy reaches the entire prudential consolidable group and prudential consolidable group.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative information presented below, we include information that completes and allows a greater understanding of the evaluation of the degree to which the economic activities of the Renta 4 Group are eligible and aligned with the ESG taxonomy.\n\nIn this regard, the following qualitative aspects should be highlighted:\n\n· Business model of Renta 4\n\nRenta 4's business model is mainly based on the provision of intermediation and management of asset services to customers, meaning that demand deposits from our customers mainly take the form of the following assets: short and medium-term debt issues of central and regional governments, as well as in Eurosystem deposits and in current accounts of Credit Institutions, subject to prudential supervision and domiciled in States belonging to the European Union, which are high-liquidity and low-risk assets with the aim of preserving the economic value of the sums deposited by customers.\n\nThus, at the end of 2023 approximately 73% of the exposures on the balance sheet are excluded for the purposes of calculating the numerator and denominator of the GAR, representing exposures to central banks by 41%, exposures to central administrations and supranational issuers by 30%, and exposures classified as trading book by 2%.\n\nIn addition, the Renta 4 Group, in a less relevant way, provides financing activities, mainly materialised in the granting of credit for investment, supported practically entirely by the creation of collateral considered effective. This financing operation, since it does not aim to finance the economic activities of the accredited person, does not constitute one of the economic activities considered eligible, nor aligned with the European taxonomy.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with this regulation, all the financing activity carried out by the Group is considered to have a generic objective, assigning the degree of eligibility and alignment of operations to each of the climate objectives required according to the relative weight represented by the exposures to counterparties over the total eligible and aligned activities according to each key risk indicator used.\n\n· Data sources and taxonomy implementation calendar\n\nIn the search for data relating to the assessment of the degree of eligibility and alignment of counterparty exposures with respect to the climate objectives of the taxonomy, both the search for public sources of counterparty information has been used, as well as external suppliers specialised in the matter.\n\nWith regard to the limitation in these public sources, it should be noted that, according to the calendar for the application of the taxonomy, at the end of 2022, only non-financial companies were obliged to disclose the degree of eligibility and alignment of their economic activities. All other financial companies will be obliged to disclose this information in this financial year.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that, until this year, only the eligibility requirements for environmental objectives for climate change mitigation and adaptation had been established. In the 2023 financial year, through Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023, the requirements of economic activities to be their eligibility in relation to the rest of the environmental objectives were regulated, as well as the technical criteria for considering those economic activities as environmentally sustainable (aligned with the taxonomy).\n\nbe highlighted:\n\nidar\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this regard, taking into account the lack of mandatory reporting of financial institutions, the absence of the possibility of temporary comparability of information reported by non-financial companies, and the limitation of this to only two previously regulated climate objectives, it makes it difficult to properly assess the contribution of companies to achieving the objectives.\n\nIn the case of external information providers, it should be noted that they also suffer from the limited availability of information from public sources for the reasons mentioned above.\n\n#### · Limitations in the target area\n\nThe Renta 4 Group does not have financial guarantees supporting debt instruments, therefore, according to the regulations, they fall outside the scope of this document\n\nIn addition, the underlying assets managed by managers will not be broken down in this financial year in view of the operational difficulties involved.\n\nTherefore, the scope of the assessment of the degree of eligibility and alignment of off-balance sheet assets will be limited to assets managed and deposited in Group companies that are managers.\n\n· Additional information regarding the estimated eligibility for the four environmental objectives regulated in the financial year 2023, and the first two objectives for companies other than non-financial corporations\n\nIn this table, the potential degree of eligibility of the economic activities of counterparties is estimated for each of four environmental objectives covered by Delegated Regulation EU 2486/2023, by matching the NACE of the counterparty and the eligible activities in the taxonomy for each of the objectives.\n\nAlso derived from the taxonomy implementation schedule, it is included in the following table.\n\n**Potential degree of eligibility of financial counterparts' economic activities, with respect to climate

REMUNERATION POLICY OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR IN PROGRESS**\n\n**A.1.1** To explain the current policy for the remuneration of directors applicable to the year in progress. Where relevant, certain information may be stated in relation to the remuneration policy approved by the general meeting of shareholders, provided the addition is clear, specific and concrete.\n\nThe specific determinations for the current year shall be described, both of the remuneration of directors for their status as such and for the performance of executive functions that the board has carried out in accordance with the provisions of the contracts signed with the executive directors and with the remuneration policy approved by the general shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe following aspects, as a minimum, must be reported in any case:\n\n- **a)** Description of the procedures and bodies of the company involved in determining and applying the remuneration policy and their conditions.\n- **b)** State and where appropriate explain whether consideration have been given to comparable companies for the purposes of establishing the company's remuneration policy.\n- **c)** Information as to whether an external advisor was involved and, should this be the case, the identity of the advisor.\n- **d)** Procedures under the existing directors' remuneration policy for applying temporary exceptions to the policy, the conditions under which such exceptions may be used and the components that may be subject to exception under the policy.\n\nThe purpose of the remuneration policy (the \"RP\") on directors of Renta 4 Banco, S.A. (the \"Company\" or \"Renta 4\") is to align the interests of the shareholders with those of the Company, seeking prudent management of the activity and minimizing the risks inherent in it, rewarding the work of the Company's personnel in achieving this purpose and ensuring that remuneration is adjusted to the market conditions of credit institutions that are comparable in terms of their size, and to criteria of moderation and adaptation to the Company's results. All of the above, in accordance with the Regulations of the Board of Directors (the \"BoD\") of Renta 4, and in order to contribute to the Company's ability to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries out its activity.\n\nIn this regard, and within the framework of the provisions of the Byelaws, the Regulations of the BoD of the Company assign to this body the power to adopt the decisions to be proposed to the General Meeting (GMS) regarding the remuneration of directors. In accordance with the best corporate governance practices, the Board of Directors (\"BoD\") of the Company has, for the best performance of its duties, established Committees that assist it in matters within its remit. Of these, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (the \"ARC\") is the body that advises and informs the BoD on remuneration issues, among others, assigned to it in the Board Regulations, ensuring compliance with the remuneration policy established by the Company's GMS and proposing, where appropriate, any modifications it deems appropriate.\n\nFor this reason, the BoD, in the exercise of its functions, shall approve, at the proposal of the ARC, the RP for the next 3 years and submit it to the Company's GMS for approval.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article 32 of the Board of Directors Regulations, the ARC is currently made up of three members appointed by the Board of Directors, Ms. Gema Aznar Cornejo, Mr. Jose Ramon Rubio Laporta, as independent directors and Mr. Pedro Ángel Navarro Martínez, as other external director. This ARC meets as often as is necessary for the performance of its duties, convened by its Chairman or, as the case may be, by the Chairman of the BoD, at least once a quarter.\n\nIn 2023, the ARC met three times to discuss issues within its remit.\n\nWithout prejudice to other duties assigned to it by the BoD, the ARC has, in relation to matters of remuneration, the following powers:\n\n- to ensure that the remuneration policy established by the Company is observed and, in particular, review it on a regular basis and propose to the BoD the RP for directors, senior executives, executive committees, executive directors and, where appropriate, categories of employees who, owing to the duties they perform, are included in the remuneration policy by virtue of the applicable regulations, the application thereof, including share-based remuneration systems and their application, as well as to guarantee that individual remuneration is proportional to that paid to directors and senior executives;\n\n- to propose the individual remuneration and the terms and conditions of the contracts of executive directors and the basic conditions of the contracts of senior executives, all in accordance with the RP approved by the GMS;\n\n- to oversee the transparency of remuneration and the observance of the remuneration policy established by the Company.\n\nIn this sense, the ARC will propose, if appropriate, the corresponding modifications of the RP to the BoD, for its submission and subsequent approval, if necessary, by the GMS.\n\nThe Regulations of the BoD, both with regard to the ARC itself and for directors in general, establish that all of them may request external advice on any matters they consider necessary. In this regard, it should be noted that in the 2023 financial year neither the ARC nor the BoD have requested and, therefore, have not had the assistance of external advisers to establish this remuneration policy.\n\nThe Company's Corporate Governance rules have been configured so that proposals submitted for consideration by the BoD in remuneration matters originate from the ARC, which analyses them beforehand, relying on the Company's internal services and external experts when necessary. In addition, all remuneration decisions affecting the directors have been submitted (or will be submitted) to an advisory vote of the Company's GMS, which ensures the appropriate decision-making process in relation to remuneration.\n\n**A.1.2** Relative importance of items of variable remuneration in relation to the fixed items (remuneration mix) and the criteria and objectives taken into account to determine them and to guarantee a proper balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration. In particular, indicate the actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system to reduce exposure to excessive risks and align it with the company's objectives, values and long-term interests, including, where appropriate, a reference to measures envisaged to ensure that the remuneration policy addresses the company's longterm performance of the company, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the entity's risk profile and measures envisaged to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nAlso indicate whether the company has established any vesting or consolidation period for certain variable remuneration items, in cash, shares or other financial instruments, a period of deferral in the payment of amounts or delivery of financial instruments already vested and consolidated, or whether any clause has been agreed to reduce deferred remuneration not yet consolidated or that obliges the director to the reimbursement of remuneration received when such remuneration has been based on data has subsequently been proven to be manifestly inaccurate.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy seeks to establish a remuneration scheme appropriate to the engagement and responsibility undertaken by the people to whom it applies, with the aim of attracting, retaining and motivating the most outstanding professionals as well as contributing to the Company so that it is able to meet its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries on its activity. For this reason, and as established in the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the remuneration will be adjusted to the market conditions of credit institutions of a size similar to Renta 4 and based on criteria of moderation and proportionality to the results of the Company.\n\nTherefore, the remuneration policy is based, among other things, on the following principles:\n\n**(a)** The Remuneration Policy applies both to executive and non-executive members of the Board of Directors, to senior executives, as well as to categories of employees of the Company whose professional activities have a material impact on the Company's risk profile and those who exercise control functions, as well as categories of employees of the Company who receive a global remuneration that includes them in the same scale of remuneration as that of senior executives and employees who take on risks, whose professional activities have a material impact on the Company's risk profile.,in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\n**(b)** The Remuneration Policy is compatible with appropriate and effective management of risk, and fosters such management in all circumstances, without offering, consequently, incentives for a assuming a level of risk that exceeds the level of risk tolerated by the Company.\n\n**(c)** The Remuneration Policy is aligned and compatible with the Company's business strategy, objectives, values and long-term interests, and is subject to annual review, with the Board proposing, as appropriate, any modifications it deems appropriate.\n\n**(d)** The remuneration paid by the Company in accordance with these principles follows criteria of moderation and proportionality to the Group's results, and favours sound and effective risk management that prevents conflicts of interests.\n\n**(e)** In this sense, remuneration establishes an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable items, and takes into consideration the responsibility and level of commitment of each individual, as well as all types of current and future risks.\n\n**(f)** The variable remuneration has sufficient flexibility that enables its modulation to the point that it is possible to completely eliminate variable remuneration.\n\n**(g)** EIt assesses performance in order to calculate the variable items of remuneration or the funds to pay for these items; an adjustment is made for all types of current and future risks, and the cost of capital and liquidity required is taken into account.\n\n**(h)** Variable remuneration is only paid if it is sustainable with the situation of the Company, and if it is justified based on the results of the Company, the business unit and the employee in question, and the Company may, for these purposes, retain part or even all of it.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis assessment is part of a multi-year framework ensuring that the assessment process is based on long-term results and that the actual payment of variable items is spread over the period covered by the Remuneration Policy.\n\n**(i)** Payments for early termination of a contract are based on the results obtained over time, established in such a way that they do not reward poor performance.\n\n**(j)** The pension policy is compatible with the Company's business strategy, objectives and values and long-term interests of the Company.\n\n**(k)** Any scheme for rights of widowhood, orphanhood and death that is established is consistent with the market and the provisions of applicable regulations.\n\nFurthermore, in relation to the relative weight of variable remuneration items in relation to fixed ones, the principles on which the Remuneration Policy is based state that it will establish an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable items, always taking into consideration the responsibility and level of commitment involved in the role that each individual is called upon to play, as well as all types of current and future risks, an aspect that is covered in the Policy. In this regard, the Company's executive directors currently receive variable remuneration based on the performance of their executive duties, as indicated in section A.1.6 below.\n\nIn relation to the measures established in the Remuneration Policy that takes into account the results of the Company, according to provisions of section A.1.6. below that includes the objective criteria relating to the evolution of the Company's results for determining directors' variable remuneration. Furthermore, the Company's Remuneration Policy provides for an adequate balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration for, as noted in section A.1.6, variable compensation depends on the achievement of objective criteria established by the CA and linked mainly to the objective results of the Company, level of delinquency and ESG policies.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the clawback formulae or clauses to claim back variable components of remuneration, it is envisaged that in the event that the assessments conclude that performance has been deficient, the Company may reduce the deferred variable remuneration and/or claim the reimbursement of the variable remuneration already paid, up to a maximum of 100%, in either case. These assessments will analyse subsequent performance according to the criteria (indicated in section A.1.6 below), which contributed to achieving the objectives, comparing it with the initial performance assessment and will be approved by the Board of Directors at the end of the year to which said variable remuneration refers.\n\n**A.1.3** The amount and nature of any fixed components expected to accrue in the course of the year to directors in their capacity as such.\n\nNon-Executive Directors shall receive annual remuneration appropriate to market standards for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, taking into account the duties and responsibilities exercised by each of the directors within the Board itself or its Committees.\n\nThe amount of the remuneration that the Company may pay to the entirety of its Non-Executive Directors for these items shall not exceed the maximum amount set for this purpose by the General Meeting.\n\nIn this sense, the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors will consist of a fixed annual amount for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, amounting to €80,000 gross per annum for each of them.\n\nIn addition, those non-executive Board Members who are members of any of the Board Committees, whether as Chairman or member, shall receive 20,000 euros gross per year, in addition to the remuneration they receive in their capacity as non-executive directors. As a rule of good governance, the committees shall be composed solely of Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe maximum overall amount shall be €920,000, at the rate of €80,000 gross for each of the ten (10) Non-Executive Directors currently forming the Board, increased by an additional €120,000, €20,000 for each member of the two (2) existing Board committees, which are currently made up of three (3) members in each.\n\nIf the number of members of each of the two (2) commissions is increased, up to a maximum of four (4) members, i.e. up to a maximum of eight (8) members in total, the maximum overall amount would be €960,000 for all Non-Executive Directors. This amount includes both the annual fixed remuneration for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors, as well as the remuneration corresponding to the membership of the commissions of up to a maximum of eight (8) members in total.\n\nThe Executive Directors will not receive any remuneration for their position as Company Directors, and their remuneration will only be that received for their executive functions, as indicated in the following sections, the scheme of which is set out in section A.1.item 4 below.\n\n**A.1.4** The amount and nature of any fixed components that will accrue in the year to directors for performance of senior management functions of the executive directors.\n\nIt should be noted that the remuneration system established by the company for executive directors takes into account the specific characteristics of each position, the duties attributed, the level of responsibility, the level of commitment taken on and engagement required, all for the purpose of the ARC establishing, determining and/or updating remunerations in order to be competitive in the market in equivalent posts in competing companies.\n\nThe executive directors whose appointment as directors is associated with their executive functions are:\n\n- Chairman with executive functions: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo.\n\n- CEO: Mr Juan Luis López García.\n- Director and General Manager: Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González.\n- Director and Regional Manager: Mr Santiago González Enciso.\n\nThe compensation of executive directors, based on their responsibility, attributed duties and level of commitment, in terms of fixed remuneration for financial year 2024 will be as follows:\n\n**i.** Chairman: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, Executive Chairman received a fixed annual remuneration of €300.000 gross, to be paid in 12 equal monthly instalments.\n\n**ii.** The CEO of the Company Mr Juan Luis López García will have fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n**iii.** Director and General Manager Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, will have a fixed annual compensation of €275,000 gross.\n\n**iv.** Director and General Manager Mr Santiago González Enciso, will have a fixed annual compensation of €95,000 gross.\n\nIn relation to the estimation of the fixed annual remuneration, given that the amounts indicated are fixed and will not depend on any objective or variable aspect, there is no estimation in this regard, where said amount are the fixed remuneration each of them will receive during the year 2024 for their positions.\n\n**A.1.5** Amount and nature of any remuneration in kind component that will be accrued in the year, including, but not limited to, insurance premiums paid on behalf of the director.\n\nThe Company has taken out a group liability insurance policy that covers any liability of any kind for acts and conduct of the Executive Officers (Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, General Manager and Regional Director), as well as those of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company, as a result of the performance of the activities inherent to their functions.\n\n**A.1.6** The amount and nature of the variable components, with a distinction made between those established in the short term and in the long term.

Variable Remuneration of the Chairman for his executive functions:**\n\nMr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, as Executive Chairman, in 2024 will receive an Annual Variable Remuneration (\"AVR\") determined by the corresponding amount accrued according to the level of compliance with the year's targets linked to the Net Profit of the Group (\"NP\"), which will be set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that are specifically assigned by the Board of Directors (\"BoD\") to the Chairman.\n\nIn line with the principles, the Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying moderation and adequacy criteria to the results of the Renta 4 Group, favours a solid and effective risk management. For this reason, AVR will be received provided that the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the financial year are less than 5% of the Net Profit (\"NP\") at the end of the year and when these levels do not occur as a result of actions by the Company, in which the risk levels and limits permitted and established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) or any other competent entity for this purpose are exceeded, due to defects in the control systems of the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to omission or poor practices by the Company.\n\nOn the other hand, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element in terms of remuneration of the group and links it to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. The components of remuneration contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. Therefore, the Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met. All of the above will be included in the annual performance evaluation carried out by the Company's Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe annual targets will be calculated on the basis of the NP and for the year 2024, they have been established according to the following scale:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration, hereinafter, \"FAR\". - Net Profit: €[18– 19) million = 14 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[19– 20) million = 28 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[20- 21) million = 42 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[21- 22) million = 56 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[22- 23) million = 70% of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[23- 24) million = 84 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[24- 25) million = 98 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[25- 26) million = 112 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[26- 27) million = 126 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[27- 28) million = 140 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[28- 29) million = 154 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[29- 30) million = 168 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[30- 31) million = 182 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: €[31- 32) million = 196 % of \"FAR\" - Net Profit: > €32 million = 200 % of \"FAR\"\n\nIn order to determine the AVR to be received by the President in each year, an assessment shall be carried out (i) of the proper management of the integration of sustainability risks and ESG policies, as well as (ii) of the achievement of the annual profit targets, once all the necessary figures that have been established as objectives are known.\n\n#### **2.2. Remuneration of CEO and of Director and General Manager**\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Juan Luis López García and the Director and General Manager, Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González will receive an AVR that will be determined by the corresponding amount accrued depending on the level of compliance with the Year's Targets, linked to the Net Profit of the Group (\"NP\"), to be established annually.\n\nIn line with the principles, the Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying moderation and adequacy criteria to the results of the Renta 4 Group, favours a solid and effective risk management.

Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible.\n\nTherefore, the Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met. All of the above will be included in the annual performance evaluation carried out by the Company's Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn order to determine the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to the Executive Chairman, CEO, General Manager and Regional Manager, an assessment shall be made i) on the appropriate management of ESG policies and sustainability risk integration, as well as ii) of the degree of compliance with the annual objectives ('AO'), once all the figures linked to said objectives are known and the provisions of article 34.1.g of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit entities, shall be applied.\n\nIf the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration that each of them would be entitled to receive is between 0% and 100% of \"FAR\", 60% shall be paid within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of March of the calendar year following the corresponding financial year in which it has accrued.\n\nThe remaining 40% will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a maximum rate of 10% in each of the four deferral periods. The payment due must be made before the end of the corresponding month of March of the calendar year following each of the years in which the deferral has taken place.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nOn the other hand, if the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration is between 100% and 200% of the AVR, it will be considered as a \"particularly high amount\" in accordance with letter m) of Article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of Credit Companies and 40% of the amount of this \"especially high amount\" AVR shall be paid, within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the finalization of the month of March of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued.\n\nThe remaining 60% of the \"particularly high\" AVR will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a rate of 15% of the total of this AVR in each of the deferral years.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nThe payment of the Total AVR will be made 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in shares, both the AVR accrued between 0% and 100% of \"FAR\", whose payment is 60% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the year in which it has\n\naccrued, deferring the 40% in the following 4 calendar years, as in the case of the \"particularly high amount\" AVR accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the FAR, whose payment is 40% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the year in which it has accrued, varying the 60% in the following 4 calendar years at a rate of 15% per year.\n\nIn order to calculate the number of accrued shares to be delivered, for each payment year the share's average market value during the last 20 business days of the previous year shall be taken into consideration, the shares being non-transferable for a period of 3 years from delivery, unless (i) there is, at the time of transmission or financial year, a net economic exposure to a change in the share price for a market value equivalent to an amount of at least 2 times its annual fixed remuneration through share ownership; or (ii) in respect of the actions that need to be disposed of to meet the costs related to their acquisition or, after favourable assessment by the Commission of Appointments and Remunerations, to deal with extraordinary situations which arise.\n\nIn any case, the Company may claim the reimbursement of the variable components of the remuneration paid, when payment has not been in accordance with the conditions established for its accrual, provided that this is due to justifiable reasons and they are duly accredited or when they have been paid based on data whose inaccuracy is subsequently accredited. Likewise, the Company may not proceed with the payment, in whole or in part, of the deferred remuneration corresponding to a specific period if, when payment is due, an extraordinary event were to occur that made it advisable to do so.\n\nThe total amount of the AVR obtained as a result of the application of the AVR system, depending on the level of fulfilment of the NP and objectives set for the Executive Chairman, CEO, General Manager and Regional Manager, may not involve the Group's NP falling below €18M by 2024. Otherwise, the Total VR Amount will have to be adjusted proportionally until the 2024 NP is at least €18 million.\n\nLikewise, and to estimate the total amount of the variable remunerations to which the current system would give rise, depending on the level of fulfilment with the assumptions or objectives taken as a benchmark, the Company considers that it could be determined in the following maximum amounts:\n\n- Chairman with executive functions: Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo would receive a maximum of €600,000 gross. - CEO: -The CEO, Mr Juan Luis López García will receive a maximum of €550,000 gross. - General Manager: Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González €550.000 gross. - Regional Manager: Mr Santiago González Enciso €190,000 gross.\n\n**A.1.7** Main characteristics of long-term savings systems. Among other information, it shall indicate the contingencies covered by the system, whether it is a contribution or defined benefit system, the annual contribution to be made to the defined contribution systems, the benefit to which the beneficiaries are entitled in the case of defined benefit systems, the conditions for consolidation of the economic rights in favor of the directors and their compatibility with any type of payment or indemnity for termination or early termination, or derived from the termination of the contractual relationship, under the terms provided, between the company and the Director.\n\nIt must be specified whether the accrual or consolidation of any long-term savings plans are linked to the achievement of certain objectives or parameters relating to the short-term and long-term performance of the director.\n\nThe Company has not undertaken any pension, retirement or similar obligations for non-executive directors.\n\nWith regard to the executive directors, since 2007 the Company has been covering the contingencies of retirement, work disability, death, severe dependency or major dependency by setting up systems of defined contribution employment plans with the coverage and vesting in accordance with the regulations for Pension Plans, to which €600 are currently contributed annually, as well as the insurance premium to cover these contingencies for each of them, all of which are compatible with the compensations included in A.8. The contributions made in 2023, as well as the accumulated amounts, are included in C.1.a) iii).\n\nThe accrual or vesting of long-term savings plans is not linked to the fulfilment of the targets set for the directors.\n\n**A.1.8** CAny type of payment or indemnification for early termination or early dismissal resulting from ending the contractual relationship under the terms established between the company and the director, whether the termination is at the will of the company or of the director, as well as any type of agreed covenants, such as exclusivity, postcontractual non-competition and permanence or loyalty, which entitle the director to any type of payment.\n\nThe Company's non-executive directors are not contractually entitled to receive any compensation in the event of resignation or dismissal.\n\nFor executive directors, Renta 4 has established compensation in the event of dismissal, unfair dismissal or termination of the employment relationship for reasons beyond the Director's control.

All this in order to contribute to the Company meeting its strategic objectives within the framework in which it carries out its activity.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **B. OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE COURSE OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR**\n\n**B.1.1** Explain the process carried out to apply the remuneration policy and determine the individual remuneration set out in section C of this report. This information shall include the role played by the remuneration committee, the decisions taken by the board of directors and, if applicable, the identity and role of the external advisors whose services have been used in the process of application of the compensation policy in the year ended.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 22 February 2022 and at the proposal of the ARC, resolved, under point nine of the Agenda, to approve the Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 and, in turn, to submit it for approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, which approved this policy with 99.99% in favor and 0.001% abstentions of those present or representing share capital, in accordance with the responsibility, functions attributed and level of commitment taken on by the Renta 4 directors.\n\nLikewise, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of 26 February 2024, and pursuant to the process of assessment of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman, the CEO and the Coordinating Director, as well as the performance of the Company in 2023 through the results included in the financial statements, has determined, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy in force, the variable remuneration due to directors with executive functions specified in section C below.\n\n**B.1.2** Explain any deviations from the established procedure for the application of the remunerations policy that have occurred during the fiscal year.\n\nThere have been no deviations from the procedure established for the application of the remuneration policy during the financial year 2023.\n\n**B.1.3** Indicate whether any temporary exceptions have been applied to the remuneration policy and, if applied, explain the exceptional circumstances that have led to the application of these exceptions, the specific components of the remuneration policy affected and the reasons why the entity considers that these exceptions have been necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the company as a whole or to ensure its viability. Also quantify the impact that the implementation of these exceptions has had on the compensation of each director during the year.\n\nThere have been no temporary exceptions to the compensation policy during the financial year.\n\n**B.2.** Explain the different actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system and how they have contributed to reducing exposure to excessive risks and aligning it with the company's objectives, values and long-term interests, including a reference to the measures that have been taken to ensure that the remuneration accrued has addressed the long-term performance of the company and achieved an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable components of remuneration, what measures have been taken in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the entity, and what measures have been taken to avoid conflicts of interest, if any.\n\nIn relation to the measures envisaged to guarantee that the Remuneration Policy takes into account the long-term results of the Company, section A.1. below includes the objective criteria relating to the Company's results applied to determine directors' variable remuneration.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's Remuneration Policy finds a suitable balance between the fixed and variable items in the remuneration considering that, as shown in section A.1. above, the variable remuneration set for 2023 is based on the fulfilment of the objective criteria defined by the Board, always linked to the objective results of the Company and subject to the Remuneration Policy approved\n\nat the Ordinary General Meeting of 30 March 2022.\n\nLastly, in relation to the clawback formulae or clauses to claim back the variable remuneration items, it is envisaged that, should the assessments conclude a deficient performance, or when they have been paid on the basis of data subsequently found to be inaccurate, the Company may reduce the deferred variable remuneration and/or claim the reimbursement of the variable remuneration already paid, up to a maximum of 100%, in either case. These evaluations analyse the evolution of the subsequent performance according to the criteria (indicated in section A.1 above, as they are the same for the current year and the reported year), which contributed to achieving the objectives, comparing it with the initial performance assessment and will be approved by the Board of Directors at the end of the year such variable remuneration refers to.\n\n**B.3.** Explain how the remuneration accrued during the year meets the provisions of the remuneration policy in force and, in particular, how it contributes to the sustainable and long-term performance of the company.\n\nAlso report on the relationship between the remuneration obtained by the directors and the results or other short and long term performance measures of the entity, explaining, if applicable, how variations in the company's performance may have had an impact on the change in directors' remuneration, including accruals for which payment has been deferred, and how they contribute to the short- and long-term results of the company.\n\nBased on the Company's director remuneration policy for 2023 indicated in section B.7 below, the executive directors' remuneration is linked to the results produced by the Company. In this regard, and taking into account what is indicated in said section, certain variable remuneration is conditional upon fulfilment of the indicators also included in section B.7. below.\n\nIn 2023, the total remuneration paid to the Company's directors in their capacity as such was €920,000, in observance of the maximum amount of €960,000 for this item as established in the Remuneration Policy and approved by the GSM. Individual remuneration of each Director in his capacity as such, consisted of an annual fixed amount, as established in said policy and those non-executive directors who were part of any of the committees, received an additional annual remuneration under this item, the amount being proportional to the time in which each director was on the Board and/or on the committee. Executive directors did not receive remuneration for their membership of the Board of Directors or of its committees; nor did they receive any annual fixed amounts, or of attendance fees for meetings of the Board of Directors. In this regard, the executive directors received remuneration in the amounts to which they were entitled by virtue of their respective contracts drawn up with the Company, pursuant to the Remuneration Policy.\n\nAt a meeting on 26 February 2024, at the behest of the ARC, the Board of Directors determined the sums of the annual variable remuneration of Executive Directors accrued in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nFor the purposes of determining the variable remuneration accrued to the executive directors, consideration was given to professional engagement and excellence, the level of achievement of the targets of the annual budget, investment targets, and the result of assessment of the performance of their duties, in relation to which a variable remuneration of 126% was determined in relation to the fixed annual remuneration to which each director is entitled.

**Observations**\n\n**B.5.** Explain how the fixed items accrued during the financial year by the directors in their capacity as such have been determined, their proportion by director and how they have varied with respect to the previous financial year.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 22 February 2022 and at the proposal of the ARC, resolved, under point nine of the Agenda, to approve the Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 and, in turn, to submit it for its approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, which approved the policy at its ordinary meeting on 30 March 2022, taking into account the market standards to determine the fixed annual remuneration for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn this regard, each non-executive director, as such, during the financial year 2023 has received a fixed annual amount for the performance of their functions as a member of the Board of Directors of €80,000.00 per year, and those who form part of any of the Board's commissions have received an additional annual remuneration of €20,000.\n\n**B.6.** Explain how the salaries accrued during the year to each of the executive directors for carrying out management functions were determined, and how they changed compared to the previous year.\n\nIn accordance with the Remunerations Policy approved at the ordinary

remuneration of €300,000 gross.\n\n• Mr Juan Luis López García, CEO received a fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n• Mr Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager, received a fixed annual remuneration of €275,000 gross.\n\n• The Director and Regional Manager Mr Santiago González Enciso received a fixed annual remuneration of €95,000 gross.\n\nIt should be noted that the fixed remuneration paid to the Executive Directors during the 2023 fiscal year amounted to 945,000, the same amount received by all of them, as fixed remuneration in 2022, 2021 and 2020, except for Mr. Enciso for whom an increase in remuneration was approved in 2021 to an annual gross amount of €95,000, from the €75,000 he had been receiving in previous fiscal years.\n\n**B.7.** Explain the nature and main characteristics of the variable components of the remuneration systems accrued in the course of the year.\n\n#### In particular:\n\n- **a)** Identify each of the compensation plans that have determined the different variable compensation accrued by each of the directors during the fiscal year ended, including information on their scope, date of approval, date of implementation, vesting conditions, if any, vesting periods and term, criteria used for performance evaluation and how this has impacted on the setting of the variable amount accrued, as well as the measurement criteria used and the time required to be able to adequately measure all conditions and criteria should be explained in detail in terms of the time required and methods for verifying that the conditions and criteria have been effectively met performance conditions or any other type of conditions to which the accrual and vesting of each component of variable compensation was linked.\n- **b)** In the case of stock option plans or other financial instruments, the general characteristics of each plan shall include information on the conditions both to acquire unconditional ownership (vesting) and to be able to exercise such options or financial instruments, including the exercise price and term.\n- **c)** Each of the directors, and their category (executive directors, external proprietary directors, independent external directors or other external directors), who are beneficiaries of remuneration systems or plans that include variable remuneration.\n- **d)** Where appropriate, information will be provided in relation to any periods established for the accrual or deferral of payment that may have been applied, and/or retention/non-availability periods for shares or other financial instruments, if any.\n\nExplain the short-term variable components of the remuneration systems:\n\nThe Remuneration Policy establishes that non-executive directors shall not have a Variable Remuneration Plan.\n\nAs regards the executive directors, the variable remuneration model established in the financial year 2023 is as follows:\n\n**1) Variable remuneration of Mr Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, as Executive Chairman.**\n\nMr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo will receive an Annual Variable Remuneration (\"AVR\"), consisting of up to a maximum of 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration (\"AFR\").\n\nThe Annual Variable Remuneration is determined by the amount corresponding to the amount accrued in accordance with the fulfilment of year's targets linked to the Net Profit of the Group, (\"Year's Targets\") that have been fixed in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that the Board of Directors has specifically assigned to the Chairman.\n\nIn line with the principles of the Renta 4 Remuneration Policy, in addition to applying the criteria of moderation and proportionality to the results of the Renta 4 Group, solid and effective risk management is fostered. For this reason, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the year remain below 5% of the Equity at year end, and when such levels are not attributed to the Company's actions, when the risk levels and limits allowed and established by the EBA (European Bank Authority) or any other competent organization are exceeded, due to deficient control systems used by the Renta 4 Group or any other cause attributed to the Company's inaction or poor practices. Furthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. Therefore, this Remuneration Policy will also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\n#### **2) Variable Remuneration of CEO and of the Director and General Manager**\n\nThe 2023 Remuneration Policy establishes that the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Juan Luis López García and the Director and General Manager, Mr. Jesús Sánchez-Quiñones González receive an AVR, consisting of up to 200% of the FAR. The amount of this is accrued based on the fulfilment of year's targets set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position or those assigned.\n\nThe AVR is determined by the amount accrued depending on the level of fulfilment of the year's targets linked to the Group's Net Profit (hereinafter, the \"Year's Targets\") that were set taking into account the responsibilities and functions attached to the position, as well as any others that the Board of Directors may have assigned to the CEO and Director and General Manager.\n\nThe AVR is received if the Renta 4 Group's levels of delinquency or \"bad debt\" during the year are less than 5% of Net Assets at the end of the year, and when such levels do not arise as a result of actions by the Company in which the levels and limits are exceeded the Company's risk management systems, as well as any other cause attributable to a lack of action or malpractice on the part of the Company, are subject to the risk limits permitted and established by the EBA (European Banking Authority) or any other competent body for this purpose.\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. This Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\n#### **3) Variable Remuneration of the Director and Regional Manager**\n\nThe Director and Regional Director will receive an AVR, consisting of up to 200% of the FAR. The amount of this is accrued based on the fulfilment of year's targets set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position or those assigned.\n\nThe AVR will be determined by the amount corresponding to the amount accrued in accordance with the fulfilment of annual objectives linked to the Group's Net Profit (the \"Year's Targets\"), which will be set in accordance with the responsibilities and functions of the position, as well as any others that may be specifically assigned by the Board of Directors to the Director and Regional Director.\n\nThe AVR will be paid provided that the levels of default or bad debt losses of the Renta 4 Group during the financial year are lower than 5% of the Equity at year-end and when these levels do not occur as a result of the Company's actions, in which the risk levels and limits allowed and established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) or any other competent entity are exceeded, due to deficient control systems used by the Renta 4 Group, as well as any other cause attributable to the Company's inaction or poor practices.\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Policy considers sustainability as an essential element of the Group's remuneration. Remuneration components contribute to the promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions in order to make the business strategy sustainable and socially responsible. This Remuneration Policy shall also be linked to non-financial objectives on the integration of sustainability criteria and ESG policies. In this regard, the Annual Variable Remuneration will be received if, in addition to the Annual Targets set above, the targets set annually by the Board of Directors in ESG matters are adequately met.\n\nThe year's targets are calculated on the basis of the Renta 4 Group's Net Profit (\"NP\") calculated as shown in the following chart:\n\n- Net Profit: x < €18M = 0% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[18 – 19)M = 14% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[19 – 20)M = 28% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[20 - 21)M = 42% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[21 - 22)M = 56% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[22 - 23)M = 70% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[23 - 24)M = 84% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[24 - 25)M = 98% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[25 - 26)M = 112% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[26 - 27)M = 126% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[27 - 28)M = 140% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[28 - 29)M = 154% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[29 - 30)M = 168% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[30 - 31)M = 182% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: €[31 - 32)M = 196% of Fixed Annual Remuneration - Net Profit: > €32M = 200% of Fixed Annual Remuneration\n\nOf the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration that the Executive Chairman, the CEO, the Director, and the General Manager, as well as an assessment on the Director and Regional Director would be entitled to receive, 60% shall be paid within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of March of the calendar year following the corresponding financial year in which it has accrued. The remaining 40% will be subject to a deferral period of four years, and the accrual and payment will be perfected at a maximum rate of 10% for each of the four years of deferral. The payment due must be made before the end of the month of March of the calendar year following each of the years in which the deferral has taken place. i.e.in March 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the vesting of the accrual and payment of 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, will conduct an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on keeping up the profitability of Renta 4 Group results, taking into account the sector's circumstances during the evaluation period and adapting Renta 4's activities to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the evaluation carried out on each of them concludes that their performance has been correct and aligned with the Company's objectives.\n\nAlso, if the accrued Annual Variable Remuneration is between 100% and 200% of the AUM, it will be considered as \"especially high amount\" according to letter m) of Article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of June 26, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of Credit Companies and therefore, 40% of the amount of this \"particularly high amount\" AVR shall be paid, within a maximum period of 15 days following the completion of the assessment, and in any case, prior to the end of the month of March of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it was accrued. And the remaining 60% of this \"particularly high amount\" AVR will be subject to a deferral period of four years, with the accrual and payment being perfected at a rate of 15% of the total of this AVR in each of the years of deferral.\n\nIn order to perfect the accrual and payment of the 40% of the deferred AVR, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, will carry out an assessment at the end of each year of the deferral period, based on maintaining the profitability of the results of the Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the sector during the period evaluated and will adapt to the circumstances relating to the operations of Renta 4, to the risks assumed by it and to the activity of each of these Executive Directors, and provided that the assessment made of each one concludes that their performance was adequate and in line with the Company's targets.\n\nThe payment of the Total AVR will be made 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in shares, both the AVR accrued between 0% and 100% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, the payment of which is 60% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued, with 40% being spread over the following four calendar years, as in the case of the \"particularly high amount\" AVR accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the AFR, the payment of which is 40% in the first quarter of the calendar year following the fiscal year in which it has accrued, with 60% being spread over the following four calendar years at a rate of 15% per annum. To calculate the number of accrued shares to be delivered, for each payment year the share's average market value during the last 20 business days of the previous year shall be taken into consideration, the shares being non-transferable for a period of three years from delivery, unless (i) there is, at the time of transmission or financial year, a net economic exposure to a change in the share price for a market value equivalent to an amount of at least two times its annual fixed remuneration through share ownership; or (ii) in respect of shares that it needs to dispose of order to meet the costs related to their acquisition or, dependent on the prior favorable opinion of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, to meet extraordinary situations that arise and require it.\n\nTherefore, as the Group's Net Profit in 2023 was €26,127 million and the default level was less than 5% and the ESG targets have been met, consequently the level of fulfilment of the year's targets set in the 2022-2023-2024 Remuneration Policy establishes that executive directors are entitled to receive a global AVR for 2023 of a global amount of €1,190,700 for all Executive Directors. Specifically, the total AVR for the Executive Chairman for 2023 amounts to €378,000; for the CEO, €346,500; this same figure is also for the Director and General Manager, and for the Regional Director the amount is €119,700.\n\nOf the resulting total AVR for 2023, up to 100% of this amount will be paid during the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 60% will be deferred to the following four financial years; 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, with the accrual and payment being a maximum of 10% each year for the four deferred years. The annual variable remuneration accrued that is between 100% and 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, will be considered as \"especially high amount\" according to letter m) of article 34.1 of Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on the regulation, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, and 40% of the amount of this AVR of \"especially high amount\" will be paid during the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 60% of said Annual Variable Remuneration of \"especially high amount\", will be deferred in the following 4 years; 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, improving the accrual and payment at the rate of a maximum of 15% each of the four years of deferral.\n\nThe payment of the AVR, both the deferred and non-deferred part, will be paid 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares.\n\nTherefore, during the first quarter of 2024, of the resulting total AVR for 2023, the Company will pay the Executive Directors 60% up to 100% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration and 40% of the Accrued Annual Variable Remuneration which is between 100% and 200% of the Annual Fixed Remuneration, being 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares, for a total amount of €665,280. Specifically, the Executive Chairman will receive €211,200 (€105,600 in cash and €105,600 in shares), the CEO €193,600 (€96,800 in cash and €96,800 in shares), the General Manager €193,600 (€96,800 in cash and €96,800 in shares) and the Regional Manager €66,880 (€33,440 in cash and €33,440 in shares).\n\nThe remaining amounts will be paid in the following four years (2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028), as established in the Remuneration Policy 2022-2023-2024.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the AVR accrued in the previous 2022, 2021 and 2020 financial years, 60% of which was paid during the first quarter of the financial year following the accrual (years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively), deferring the remaining 40% of each AVR in the 3 years following the accrual in the 2021 and 2020 AVR and the four following AVR accrued in 2022. In this regard, the Board, at the proposal of the ARC, during the first quarter of 2024, has carried out a performance assessment on the Executive Chairman, the CEO, the Director, and the General Manager, as well as an assessment on the Director and Regional Director, based on the profitability maintenance of Renta 4 Group, taking into account the circumstances of the industry during the assessed period. The assessment results were positive for all of them.\n\nFor this reason, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company will pay the Executive Directors, on the one hand, the first quarter (1/4) of 40% of deferred AVR corresponding to fiscal year 2022, on the other hand, the second third (2/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to fiscal year 2021, and finally, the third and last third (3/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the fiscal year 2020, being in all cases, with 50% in cash and the other 50% in shares.\n\nSpecifically, the amount corresponding to the first quarter (1/4) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to 2022, which amounts to the total of €52,920, of which Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €16,800, 50% in cash (€8,400) and the other 50% in shares (€8,400), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €15,400, 50% in cash (€7,700) and the other 50% in shares (€7,700) and finally, Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €5,320, (€962.75) in cash and (€962.75) in shares.\n\nOn the other hand, the second third (2/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the year 2021, amounts to the total amount of €126,000, of which Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €40,000, 50% in cash (€20,000) and the other 50% in shares (€20,000), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €36,666.67, 50% in cash (€18,333.34) and the other 50% in shares (€18,333.33) and finally, Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €12,666.67, (€6,333.34) in cash and (€6,333.33) in shares.\n\nAnd finally, the total amount corresponding to the last third (3/3) of the deferred 40% of the AVR corresponding to the fiscal year 2020 amounts to €67,833.33, of which, Mr. Juan Carlos Ureta Domingo, the Executive Chairman, will receive the amount of €22,000, 50% in cash (€10,000) and the other 50% in shares (€10,000), Mr. Juan Luis López García, the CEO and Mr. Jesús Sanchez-Quiñones González, Director and General Manager will each receive €20,166.67, 50% in cash (€10,083.34) and the other 50% in shares (€10,083.33) and Mr. Santiago González Enciso, Director and Regional Manager will receive the amount of €2,521.49 (€1,260.75) in cash and (€1,260.74) in shares.\n\nConsequently, of the deferred 2021 and 2022 AVR, two quarters (2/4) of the 40% of the deferred AVR, i.e. one quarter (1/4) for each of the years, should be paid in the following years, 2025 and 2026, if the annual assessment and the results of the Company so allow it. And of the deferred 2021 AVR, one third (1/3) of the 40% of the deferred AVR will be pending payment in the following year, 2025.\n\nRegarding the decisions taken by the Board for the application of these items, the Board of Directors proceeded at its meeting of 26 February 2024, at the proposal of the ARC, to approve the Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023, to be submitted, on a consultative basis, to the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nLikewise, and taking into account the performance of the Company's activity and volume of business, the Board of Directors agreed on the variable remuneration of the executive directors for 2023, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy 2022-2023-2024, at the same above-mentioned meeting.\n\nExplain the long-term variable components of the remuneration systems:\n\n**B.8.** Indicate whether certain accrued variable components have been reduced or claimed back when, in the first case, the payment of unconsolidated amounts has been deferred or, in the second case, consolidated and paid, based on data whose accuracy has subsequently been proven to be manifestly incorrect.
