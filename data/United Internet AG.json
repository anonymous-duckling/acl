Ongoing armed conflicts, inflation rates that remain high by long-term standards, and the effects of global climate change that are being felt throughout the world are occupying people everywhere. In turn, companies are also being called on more than ever before to make an active contribution and help find solutions.\n\nWe are aware of our responsibility as one of Europe's leading internet companies and are continuing to increase our focus on economic, social, and environmental sustainability in what we do. We want to improve continuously and systematically, which is why we again refined our sustainability strategy in 2023. We enhanced our mission statement and defined target approaches for our material topics. We have also anchored and extended our sustainability expertise in all four of our business areas, so as to be able to manage the measures we take even more efficiently. This enables our sustainability teams to work together even more effectively across individual brand boundaries and ensure end-to-end sustainability management for our Group.\n\nAt the same time, we need to keep on top of all of the ever-growing regulatory requirements. For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that entered into force throughout the EU in January 2023 and that will be applied as from fiscal year 2024 will radically change the form and content of sustainability reporting. We have set up a dedicated Group-wide project to prepare in detail for the new reporting requirements.\n\nWe see ourselves as building bridges to the digital future with more than 28 million fee-based customer contracts worldwide, roughly 40 million ad-financed free accounts, and a workforce of around 11,000 people. Our goal is to provide private and business users with broadband internet access and powerful cloud applications. We want to enable customers to securely access all the internet's vast opportunities as a universal information, communications, entertainment, and e-business infrastructure. We are leading the way with innovative products, new technologies, reliable infrastructure, and user-friendly services and helping to make our society fit for the future.\n\nThis applies in particular to the role of Germany's fourth mobile network operator that we have assumed with 1&1. 1&1 is the first provider in Europe to be operating a 5G network based on innovative OpenRAN technology, which is connected to 1&1 Versatel's fiber-optic network. This innovative network architecture is cloud-native and vendor-neutral, permitting extremely rapid transmission times that are vital for real-time applications. We are proud to be able to offer our customers real added value with 1&1's O-RAN.\n\nOur high standards apply to our environmental footprint as well as our technological innovations. We are aware of the impact that our business model has on the climate. We aim to use energy and resources efficiently and responsibly, to improve continuously, and to help protect the environment and the climate in everything from green logistics through to the highly efficient operations of our own data centers using green electricity.\n\nAs a successful Group, we consider ourselves to be part of society and take social responsibility. One way in which we do this is by leveraging our strong brands with their substantial reach. Our social commitment revolves around our work with the United Internet for UNICEF foundation, which United Internet launched in 2006 together with the United Nations Children's Fund. The regular appeals for donations that we make to our GMX, WEB.DE, 1&1, and IONOS customers, coupled with the additional amounts donated by the United Internet Group itself, have raised roughly €69 million for global UNICEF\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nprograms since then. We are proud to be able to contribute to UNICEF's valuable work through the foundation.\n\nOur long-term success as a company depends on our qualified, highly committed staff. We want to remain an attractive employer going forward – one that creates an open, respectful space in which individuals can develop and that actively promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are convinced that only a workforce that mirrors the many different facets of society can offer the best possible conditions for creativity and productivity, and make us – the United Internet Group – unique.\n\nHowever, for us responsible corporate governance does not stop at our own activities. We are also a reliable, fair, and trustworthy partner for our many service providers and suppliers. We have also underlined this commitment in our Policy Statement under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG). This document is publicly available on our website.\n\nActing sustainably and taking responsibility for our activities as a company have become part of our Group's DNA. We shall continue rising to the evolving challenges in our business areas openly and proactively. We are proud of the improvements we are achieving. Yet we don't want to leave it at that, but to go on getting better and better. The Management Board is looking forward to updating you on the progress we make.\n\nRalf Hartings\n\nCFO\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/6 description: A black and white portrait shows a bald man in a suit with his arms crossed.

As a European internet specialist, United Internet sees its role as building bridges to a digital future. The Group does this by taking digital, environmental, and social responsibility. United Internet is leading the way with innovative products, new technologies, reliable infrastructure, and userfriendly services and helping to make society fit for the future.\n\n## Business\n\n Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Montabaur, United Internet AG has more than 28 million feebased customer contracts worldwide and roughly 40 million ad-financed free accounts, making it one of Europe's leading Internet specialists. United Internet is expanding its fiber-optic network and establishing its own state-of-the-art mobile network, as well as offering high-performance data centers with strict security and data privacy standards. By doing so, it is laying the foundations for society to participate in the process of digital transformation and to safely navigate the digital world.\n\nThe Group's operating business is broken down into the Access Division, which comprises the Consumer Access and Business Access Segments, and the Applications Division, which consists of the Consumer Applications and Business Applications Segments.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram with two main categories: \"Access\" and \"Applications\", each divided into \"Consumer\" and \"Business\" subcategories. Under \"Access\", the \"Consumer\" subcategory lists brands like smartmobil.de, yourfone, 1&1, simplytel, DeutschlandSIM, winSIM, and maxim Premium SIM. The \"Business\" subcategory under \"Access\" lists 1&1 versatel. Under \"Applications\", the \"Consumer\" subcategory includes brands like GMX, WEB.DE, mail.com, and united internet media. The \"Business\" subcategory under \"Applications\" lists home.pl, arsys, STRATO, IONOS, sedo.com, united domains, InterNetX, fasthosts, and world4you.\n\nDivisions, segments, and brands (as of December 31, 2023)\n\n## Consumer Access Segment\n\n The Consumer Access Segment pools mobile internet and fixed-network broadband products (including associated applications such as home networking, online storage, telephony, Smart Home, IPTV, and video-on-demand) of 1&1 AG. Broadband connections are offered as subscription contracts with fixed monthly fees (and variable, volume-based charges).\n\nGRI 2-1\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE                      | EU TAXONOMY | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| Vision                               |             |                          |\n| Business                             |             |                          |\n| Sustainability at<br>United Internet |             |                          |\n\n 1&1 is one of Germany's leading providers. The Company uses 1&1 Versatel's fiber-optic transportation network, and for VDSL/vectoring connections and fiber-optic connections (\"FTTH\" = \"fiber to the home\") it uses city carriers and Deutsche Telekom (mainly Layer-2) for the \"last mile\".\n\nDIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nUnited Internet is also one of Germany's leading providers for mobile internet products. Since the launch of mobile services on December 8, 2023, 1&1's mobile communications network has been fully operational. Where 1&1 cannot offer adequate network coverage during its years of network expansion, it uses national roaming. This is currently provided by Telefónica and as of summer 2024 national roaming services are to be procured from Vodafone. National roaming is a standard procedure used in the rollout of new mobile networks that enables customers to surf and make calls without interruption in areas not yet covered. This is achieved by automatically using the roaming partner's antennas in these areas.\n\nUntil 1&1 has migrated its more than 12 million existing customers to its own 1&1 mobile network, it will also use the Telefónica mobile network as a so-called Mobile Bitstream Access Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MBA MVNO), as well as MVNO capacities of Vodafone. As of the beginning of 2024, existing MVNO customers are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network.\n\nMobile internet products are marketed via the premium brand 1&1 as well as via discount brands, such as winSIM and sim.de.\n\n## Business Access Segment\n\n United Internet's Business Access Segment offers a comprehensive range of telecommunications products and services for business customers via 1&1 Versatel. The segment's business model revolves around its operation of a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network, which is more than 61,000 km long. This is one of the largest networks in Germany and is being continuously expanded. 1&1 Versatel uses the network to offer companies and public authorities telecommunications products ranging from standardized fiberoptic direct connections to customized, individual information and communication solutions (voice, data, and network solutions). In addition, the 1&1 fiber-optic network is used to supply (wholesale) infrastructure services for national and international carriers.\n\n## Consumer Applications Segment\n\n The Consumer Applications Segment is home to United Internet's consumer applications. These mainly comprise personal information management applications (e-mails, to-do lists, and appointment/address management solutions) and online (cloud) storage, but also include domains, consumer website solutions, and office applications. The portfolio has been expanded, and the GMX and WEB.DE brands have been transformed in recent years from pure-play e-mail providers to end-to-end hubs for user communications, information, and identity management.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/12 description: The image shows a square with the letter A inside a circle at the top right corner of the square.

The products are offered as pay accounts or ad-financed free accounts. Online advertising is marketed by United Internet Media. With its GMX and WEB.DE brands, United Internet operates primarily in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, with the Company being one of the leading providers in the sector. Like the other segments, this segment has also been pressing ahead with its internationalization strategy since the acquisition of U.S. provider mail.com. mail.com has a presence in other countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Spain as well as in the U.S.A.\n\n## Business Applications Segment\n\n8\n\n United Internet's Business Applications Segment opens up internet-based business opportunities for freelancers, self-employed professionals, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), helping them digitalize their processes. Its broad range of products includes subscription-based domains, websites, web hosting, servers, e-shops, group work, online (cloud) storage, and office applications, among other things. Cloud solutions and cloud infrastructure services are also offered. The applications are developed in the Company's own development centers or in cooperation with partner organizations, and run on more than 100,000 servers in 11 own data centers and 21 co-locations.\n\nUnited Internet's Business Applications Segment is also an international leader in its field, with activities in Europe (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Sweden) and North America (the U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico). Applications are marketed to specific target groups using a variety of differently positioned brands: IONOS, Strato, Fasthosts, Arsys, home.pl, InterNetX, united-domains, and World4You. In addition, United Internet's Sedo brand offers customers professional aftermarket services in the area of active domain management. In another example, the we22 brand offers other hosting providers a white-label website builder for creating high-quality websites.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE                      | EU TAXONOMY |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Vision                               |             |\n| Business                             |             |\n| Sustainability at<br>United Internet |             |\n\n The need to act sustainably is now firmly embedded in social, political, and economic thinking. Like other firms, United Internet is also steadily expanding its ESG (environmental, social, and governance) activities so as to meet the needs of both current and future generations – the classic definition of sustainability. United Internet is in the middle of a Group-wide transformation process and is increasingly including sustainability aspects that are relevant to its divisions when making decisions. Core challenges and topics that the Group is addressing include sustainable digitalization, data privacy, how to deal with (fake) information on the internet, the changing world of work, and the shift to a decarbonized economy.\n\nThe objective of United Internet's sustainability management is to address the challenges and opportunities associated with its material sustainability topics.\n\n## Sustainability Management\n\n Group-wide sustainability management at the United Internet Group in the reporting period was coordinated by the Corporate Sustainability team. Centralized sustainability management tasks include overall coordination of the sustainability strategy, reporting, and answering ESG rating agency queries at Group level. One core task in the 2023 reporting period was to enhance the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nAt a decentralized level, each segment has its own sustainability management function, which regularly shares information and cooperates closely with the Group sustainability team. The segments' sustainability managers report periodically – in some cases weekly – to the segment management board member responsible and several times a year to the full management board and other bodies for the segment concerned.\n\nThis mix of central and local governance structures for sustainability management means that the segments are responsible for, and manage, certain sustainability topics. The Corporate Sustainability Team reports to United Internet AG's CFO, who is also responsible for preparing the sustainability report for the Group as a whole. Key principles such as sourcing green electricity or the Policy Statement on respect for human rights and environmental due diligence are resolved by the Group Management Board. Overarching decisions – such as target-setting for the Group-wide sustainability strategy – are also taken by Group-level management bodies. However, the majority of concrete implementation decisions – such as on introducing management systems or on what the green electricity strategy should look like in practice – are taken by the segment management boards. These also build on the sustainability strategy to set segment-specific sustainability goals and targets, taking the starting situation and the impact of the individual segment's business activities into account. United Internet's Supervisory Board fulfills its duty of oversight by examining the consolidated nonfinancial report (\"nonfinancial report\"), with the assistance of an independent external review.\n\nGRI 2-14\n\nGRI 3-3\n\n[See the section entitled](#page-9-0)  \"Progress Report and Next Steps\" on page 10.\n\nGRI 2-5\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>**Progress Report and Next Steps**\n\n- Activities in the 2023 reporting period focused on the following two projects:\n- The Group-wide sustainability strategy was enhanced and a sustainability vision and mission was formulated as part of this (see the section entitled \"Vision\"). United Internet put in place the structures needed to operationalize this strategy by defining an overarching model for cooperation between its central and local sustainability management functions. This also includes management bodies (governance structure). In addition, the Group has set itself the goal of making its commitment to sustainability and its level of ambition measurable and verifiable. As part of this, Group-wide target approaches for the material topics were developed and discussed together with the segments' sustainability management functions and the departments concerned in 2023. Since this process is still ongoing at the time of reporting, concrete, measurable goals and KPIs will be set in the course of fiscal year 2024. After this, the segments will break them down and implement them by defining specific milestones and measures.\n- Preparations for the first CSRD report for fiscal year 2024 took the form of a Group-wide project in the 2023 reporting period whose aim is to ensure compliance with the new EU reporting requirements going forward. Work on developing the future reporting strategy built on the materiality matrix from fiscal year 2023, its reconciliation to the CSRD requirements, and a comprehensive gap analysis of future quantitative and qualitative reporting requirements. The necessary transformation of the Reporting function was started and an evaluation project was used to examine the processes, IT policies, and software solutions required with the goal of facilitating data capture for everyone involved going forward, while simultaneously achieving a further improvement in both the availability and the quality of the data.\n\n## **Stakeholder Dialog**\n\n United Internet's business depends on continuous dialog and successful cooperation with a wide range of stakeholders. Close contact with a range of stakeholder groups is particularly vital with respect to its impact on society and the environment, and for identifying material sustainability aspects during the materiality analysis, developing the sustainability strategy, setting targets, and determining target achievement. United Internet uses a variety of different platforms and formats to liaise with stakeholders with the goal of further enhancing communication and cooperation with them and taking their interests into account:\n\n- Customers: United Internet focuses systematically on customer needs and satisfaction, obtaining feedback in numerous areas. It also engages in an ongoing dialog with its customers using surveys and during service calls, among other things. Test users and test buyers can generate valuable feedback for new products.\n- Investors: Investors are an important stakeholder group for United Internet. Investor Relations and the Management Board are in regular contact with them during one-on-one discussions and road shows. Open, transparent reporting strengthens shareholder trust.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE                      | EU TAXONOMY | CORPORATE<br>RESPONSIBILITY |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Vision                               |             |                             |\n| Business                             |             |                             |\n| Sustainability at<br>United Internet |             |                             |\n\n Employees: United Internet's employees are the key to the Group's success. Only by leveraging their knowledge, skills, and dedication can United Internet continue to develop and achieve longterm success. Since employee feedback is vital for United Internet, it regularly conducts surveys, uses these as the basis for defining measures to be taken, and then provides information on their implementation and the progress made within the Group. In addition, the Management Board engages in direct virtual dialog with employees about specific issues.\n\nDIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n Business partners: United Internet's business requires it to work together with a large number of business partners and supplier companies. These include wholesale service partners, hardware suppliers, call center service providers, and shipping partners, for example. Personal discussions are one of the mechanisms used with these partners, while United Internet also supports call center service providers that are training employees, for example.\n\n Politicians and associations: United Internet maintains a dialog with political decision-makers and government authorities so as to create a framework for a successful and responsible digital economy in Germany. One particular issue is ensuring competition, which acts as a driver for innovation, investment, and consumer benefits. This is why United Internet is a member of associations such as Bitkom(1), BREKO(2), BVDW(3), eco(4), and VATM(5). In addition, individual departments play an active role in other relevant associations and bodies.\n\n Non-governmental organizations: United Internet has worked with the United Nations' Children's Fund since 2006 in the United Internet for UNICEF foundation to collect donations and recruit new sustaining members.\n\n## Material Topics\n\n United Internet's material sustainability topics resulted from the materiality analysis performed in fiscal year 2022. No new potential material topics and/or risks arose in the course of the 2023 reporting period that would have resulted in the need for change. Both the internal Group perspective (impact of sustainability aspects on United Internet's business activities = relevance to United Internet's business) and the external perspective (impact of United Internet's business activities on the environment and society) were taken into account when assessing the topics, so as to determine double materiality. An external consulting firm that specializes in performing materiality analyses and developing sustainability strategies, among other things, assisted with the process of determining the material topics both in fiscal year 2022 and in the 2023 reporting period.\n\n(1) Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien e.V.\n\n(2) Bundesverband Breitbandkommunikation e.V. (3) Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V.\n\n(4) Verband der Internetwirtschaft e.V.\n\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n<sup>(5)</sup> Verband der Anbieter von Telekommunikations- und Mehrwertdiensten e.V.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Process Used to Define Material Topics**\n\n The 2022 materiality analysis was based on topics that were already known from sustainability management activities up to then and from earlier materiality analyses. The list of topics was expanded using environmental and benchmark analyses on political, economic, social, technological, statutory, and environmental aspects. Additional input came from the dialog (interviews) with the stakeholder groups mentioned above.\n\nThe internal departments (including HR, Compliance, and Information Security, in many cases at both the Group and the segment level) also discussed the relevant sustainability aspects with the participation of the management board members concerned. The topics on the updated list from fiscal year 2022 were defined in more detail in the same year together with experts from the main departments responsible and a common understanding was formulated. A survey was used to establish the employee perspective on the relevance of the sustainability topics. In addition, virtual one-on-one interviews were conducted with internal and external stakeholders so as to establish the materiality of the topics from their perspective as well.\n\nAfter this, a scoring model was used to assess the double materiality of the topics concerned along the main value chain. This examined both the topics' business relevance for United Internet and the potential and actual impact of the Group's activities on the environment and society. No risk management measures were taken into account when examining potential impacts (gross assessment). The final assessment of the topics took the form of a joint workshop with all relevant departments. The results of the materiality analysis were presented to the Group Management Board and discussed together, after which the final selection of the material topics and the priorities assigned to them were approved by the Management Board.\n\nThe 2022 materiality analysis was performed in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). It will be reviewed for validity in 2024 to comply with the new statutory requirements set out in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\nGRI 3-1\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE                      | EU TAXONOMY | CORPORATE<br>RESPONSIBILITY | DIGITAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY | SOCIAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY | ENVIRONMENTAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Vision                               |             |                             |                           |                          |                                 |\n| Business                             |             |                             |                           |                          |                                 |\n| Sustainability at<br>United Internet |             |                             |                           |                          |                                 |\n\n## **Results of the Materiality Analysis: Materiality Matrix**\n\n The materiality matrix presents the results of the analyses and summarizes the double materiality assessment. The red-colored topics in the matrix are considered to be material.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/3 description: The image is a scatter plot showing the relevance to United Internet's business on the x-axis and United Internet's impact on the environment and society on the y-axis. Both axes range from low to high. The plot contains several topics marked as either red squares (material topics) or gray squares. The topics are scattered across the plot, with some clustered in the high-high quadrant and others in the low-low quadrant. The topics include: Decarbonization, Material efficiency and circularity, Data privacy, Information Security, Digital participation, Social commitment, Environmental protection, Biodiversity, Health protection, Occupational safety, Training and education, Supply chain responsibility, Transparency and communications, Diversity, inclusion, equality, and accessibility, Working conditions, and Responsible corporate management.\n\nThe topics of responsible corporate management, working conditions, and diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility were considered to be material in view of the high scores for business relevance that they received. In addition, the environmental matters of decarbonization and material efficiency and circularity have a substantial impact on society and the environment. Information security, digital participation, and data privacy were assessed as meeting double materiality requirements. In addition, United Internet treats supply chain responsibility as a material topic in order to increase the resilience of, and social and environmental conditions in, its supply chains.\n\nThe material topics cover environmental, employee, and social matters, plus respect for human rights and anti-corruption and bribery.\n\n[See \"About this Report\"](#page-79-0)  on page 80.\n\n13\n\nGRI 3-2\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>EU TAXONOMY\n\n The EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is a uniform, binding classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Companies are obliged to report on the results of this classification on an annual basis. The aim is for them to provide an overview of which of their activities and investments are environmentally sustainable. Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation sets out six environmental objectives. The 2023 reporting period saw the introduction for the first time of concrete specifications (technical screening criteria) for environmental sustainability for all six environmental objectives (Commission Delegated Regulation (CDR) (EU) 2021/2139 and CDR (EU) 2023/2486).\n\nAs was the case in the previous year, United Internet determined both Taxonomy eligibility and Taxonomy alignment for the first two environmental objectives\n\n- Climate change mitigation and\n- Climate change adaptation\n\nfor the reporting period.\n\nIn line with the European Commission's requirements, only Taxonomy eligibility was determined for the four other environmental objectives\n\n- Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- Transition to a circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control, and\n- Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nfor the reporting period. Reference will be made to these environmental objectives later on.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible Economic Activities\n\n United Internet reviewed and reassessed its Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the reporting period. The following turnover-generating economic activities from Annex 1 of CDR 2021/2139 (environmental objective: climate change mitigation) and Annex 2 of CDR 2023/2486 (environmental objective: transition to a circular economy) were identified as Taxonomy-eligible:\n\nAs regards the first environmental objective (climate change mitigation), United Internet's business activities can be assigned in particular to Activity 8.1 \"Data processing, hosting and related activities\". United Internet's Business Applications Segment offers domains, home pages, web hosting, servers, cloud solutions and e-shops, group work, and online storage, among other things. This segment's offering is therefore responsible for the majority of the United Internet Group's Taxonomy-eligible activities. The Consumer Applications Segment is home to United Internet's consumer applications such as online storage and personal information management. Activities relating to Activity 8.1 were also identified in this segment. To a limited extent, the Consumer Access and Business Access segments contain Taxonomy-eligible activities that fall within Activity 8.1, since they provide online storage and cloud telephony.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n E U TA X O N O M Y **Taxonomy-eligible Economic Activities Taxonomy-aligned Economic Activities**  Notes on the KPIs\n\n As in the previous year, United Internet identified those activities (such as online storage) in which hosting and data storage play a key role as Taxonomy-eligible activities for the reporting period. No distinction was made between hosting and data storage activities using the Company's own or third-party data centers. Other activities that only tangentially involve data transfer are not included under Activity 8.1.\n\nThe only turnover-generating economic activities by United Internet that can currently be assigned to environmental objectives 3–6 relate to the \"transition to a circular economy\" objective. The Consumer Access Segment refurbishes returned smartphones and resells them to customers as reconditioned second-hand goods; this corresponds to Activity 5.4 \"Sale of second-hand goods\".\n\nBased on our current understanding, the core businesses of other United Internet Group areas are not covered by the EU Taxonomy. As a result, activities relating to the expansion and use of telecommunications networks were classified as Taxonomy non-eligible, as was the case in the first two years' reporting. This includes expansion of the public fiber-optic and mobile network and those business activities and investments relating to the expansion of the network infrastructure, including the equipment locations.\n\nIn addition, material horizontal issues and infrastructure-related topics were identified in connection with CapEx and OpEx at United Internet:\n\n\"Climate change mitigation\" environmental objective\n\n- 6.5 \"Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles,\" i.e., expenditure relating to the vehicle fleet\n- 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings,\" especially via IFRS 16 leases and rights of use in assets\n\nThe economic activities mentioned above are assigned solely to the \"climate change mitigation\" environmental objective, since there are currently no adaptation plans containing specific measures for the activities concerned. Because of this, no CapEx nor OpEx has been assigned to the \"climate change adaptation\" environmental objective pursuant to Commission Notice C/2023/305 (FAQs). Since the activities concerned are also not enabling activities within the meaning of this environmental objective that provide adaptation solutions that can enable another economic activity to reach a substantial contribution, no turnover has been assigned to this environmental objective. This avoids double-counting.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>Taxonomy-aligned Economic Activities\n\n United Internet worked together with the departments concerned to analyze the Taxonomy-eligible economic activities under the \"climate change mitigation\" environmental objective using the relevant technical screening criteria. The technical screening criteria for the \"transition to a circular economy\" environmental objective were not examined for the reporting period, in line with the European Commission's specifications.\n\nThe analysis of the economic activities under the \"climate change mitigation\" environmental objective produced the results below.\n\n## Activity 8.1 \"Data processing, hosting and related activities\"\n\n United Internet operates an ISO 50001-certified energy management system for its own data centers. However, the existing measures are not sufficient to meet the EU Taxonomy's technical screening criteria, since among other things no independent third-party verification of the criteria set out in the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency was performed. In addition, the third-party data center operators have not submitted confirmations that they meet the technical screening criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy. For these reasons, United Internet has not reported any Taxonomy-aligned activities under Activity 8.1 for the 2023 reporting period.\n\n## Remarks on Horizontal Issues and Infrastructure-related Topics\n\n CapEx and OpEx for horizontal issues and infrastructure-related topics relate to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions. This CapEx and OpEx is therefore limited to the \"climate change mitigation\" environmental objective (\"category (c)\").\n\nProof must be provided by partner enterprises of the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities if expenditures are to qualify as Taxonomy-aligned. Partner enterprises were requested to provide such proof for CapEx and OpEx relating to activities 6.5 and 7.7. At present, no sufficient proof is available demonstrating that the criteria required have been met. As a result, the expenditure has not been reported as Taxonomy-aligned for the 2023 reporting period.\n\n## **Remark on the KPIs**\n\n In line with Commission Notice (C/2023/305 (FAQs)), United Internet did not perform a Taxonomy alignment assessment for those activities that are not material to its business activity due to the lack of data and proof of compliance with the technical screening criteria.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-16-0\"></span> E U TA X O N O M Y Taxonomy-eligible Economic Activities Taxonomy-aligned Economic Activities **Notes on the KPIs**\n\nNotes on the KPIs\n\n The key performance indicators (KPIs) reported pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation (turnover, CapEx, and OpEx) are based on the figures given in United Internet AG's consolidated financial statements. United Internet AG's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant supplementary regulations set out section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB).\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe turnover, CapEx, and OpEx identified as associated with Taxonomy-eligible activities and the total amounts used were reconciled with the relevant population at Group level. This permitted potential double-counting to be monitored and prevented.\n\n### Turnover\n\n The Delegated Act on reporting requirements defines turnover as the revenue recognized pursuant to IAS 1.82(a). The \"turnover\" KPI disclosed for the United Internet Group represents the ratio of the turnover from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to total revenue. Total revenue can be taken from the statement of net income in United Internet AG's consolidated financial statements (see the section entitled \"Explanations of items in the income statement – 5. Sales/segment reporting\"). The denominator of the \"turnover\" KPI is based on consolidated net revenue.\n\nThe numerator of the \"turnover\" KPI is defined as that part of the net revenue from good and services that is associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. United Internet's data center products and the sale of refurbished devices are currently the only turnover-generating activities that are Taxonomyeligible. The turnover from products and rate plans that are associated with Activity 8.1 \"Data processing, hosting and related activities\" and Activity 5.4 \"Sale of second-hand goods\" was assigned accordingly in the segments concerned. Taxonomy-eligible turnover accounted for 24.1% of total revenue in the 2023 reporting period. It was not possible to report any Taxonomy-aligned turnover for Activity 8.1.\n\n#### CapEx\n\n The \"CapEx\" KPI is based on the additions to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets in the fiscal year under review before depreciation, amortization, and any remeasurements for the fiscal year in question; no adjustments are made to the fair values (in particular application of IAS 16, IAS 38, and IFRS 16 leases with rights of use in lease assets). The overall figure for capital expenditure used for the EU Taxonomy is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements under the \"Explanations of items in the income statement – 5. Sales revenue/segment reporting\" section; see the last column (\"United Internet Group\") for the line item entitled \"Investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment (without goodwill)\" in the table. This capital expenditure represents the denominator for the CapEx KPI.\n\nThe numerator of the CapEx KPI corresponds to those parts of the denominator\n\n- relating to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (\"category (a)\")\n- or relating to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions (\"category (c)\").\n\nDIGITAL\n\n[See United Internet AG's](https://www.united-internet.de/investor-relations/publikationen/berichte.html)  consolidated financial statements.\n\n[See United Internet AG's](https://www.united-internet.de/investor-relations/publikationen/berichte.html)  consolidated financial statements.\n\n[See United Internet AG's](https://www.united-internet.de/investor-relations/publikationen/berichte.html)  consolidated financial statements.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n The investments were assigned to the various Taxonomy activities using the asset classes concerned. A distinction was made in the case of the \"IFRS 16 leases\" asset class between buildings and data centers. Capital expenditure on these asset classes was generally assigned to Activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings.\" However, where this capital expenditure relates to data centers, it is assigned to Activity 8.1 \"Data processing, hosting and related activities.\" The share of Taxonomy-eligible investments in the 2023 reporting period was 10.4%. It was not possible to report any Taxonomy-aligned CapEx.\n\n### OpEx\n\n The \"OpEx\" KPI is based on the direct, non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development (R&D), building renovation measures, short-term leases, and maintenance and repair of property, plant, and equipment by the Company or third parties that are necessary to ensure the continued functioning of such assets. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 requires training costs to be included in the numerator. Consequently, these cost centers must also be included in the denominator.\n\nAt United Internet, the OpEx KPI represents that part of operating expenses as defined by the EU Taxonomy that\n\n- is associated with a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity (\"category (a)\")\n- or relates to the purchase of output and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, and to specific building renovation measures (\"category (c)\").\n\nUnited Internet's Taxonomy-eligible share of operating expenditure was determined by analyzing the cost centers for building renovation measures and short-term leases, plus its expenditure on maintenance and repair. The share of Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure was 21.5% in the 2023 reporting period. It was not possible to report any Taxonomy-aligned OpEx.\n\n## Overview of KPIs\n\n|                                                                                  | ✓ Turnover   |        | ✓ CapEx      |        | ✓ OpEx       |        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|\n|                                                                                  | in € million | in %   | in € million | in %   | in € million | in %   |\n| Total figures for the United Internet Group                                      | 6,213.2      | 100.0% | 1,089.1      | 100.0% | 105.4        | 100.0% |\n| of which Taxonomy-non-eligble                                                    | 4,716.8      | 75.9%  | 976.1        | 89.6%  | 82.7         | 78.5%  |\n| of which Taxonomy-eligble                                                        | 1,496.4      | 24.1%  | 113.0        | 10.4%  | 22.7         | 21.5%  |\n| CE(1) 5.4 Sale of second-hand goods                                              | 20.7         | 0.3%   | 0.0          | 0.0%   | 0.1          | 0.1%   |\n| CCM(2) 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles | 0.0          | 0.0%   | 6.7          | 0.6%   | 1.5          | 1.4%   |\n| CCM 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                   | 0.0          | 0.0%   | 30.5         | 2.8%   | 0.0          | 0.0%   |\n| CCM 8.1 Data processing, hosting and related activities                          | 1,475.7      | 23.8%  | 75.8         | 7.0%   | 21.1         | 20.0%  |\n| of which Taxonomy-aligned                                                        | 0.0          | 0.0%   | 0.0          | 0.0%   | 0.0          | 0.0%   |\n| (1) CE = Circular Economy                                                        |              |        |              |        |              |        |\n\n(2) CCM = Climate Change Mitigation\n\n The Taxonomy KPIs are given in the Annex (pages [82-84\\)](#page-81-0).

This means complying with all relevant laws, regulations, standards, and ethical practices. Its defined Corporate Values, its Leadership Principles, and the Code of Conduct serve as the basis for enabling fair, respectful dealings with all stakeholder groups and for preventing corrupt business practices.\n\nFor United Internet, compliance is the precondition for doing business successfully in the long term and hence an integral part of all Group activities. The Code of Conduct for employees summarizes the key rules and lays the foundations for lawful and ethically unobjectionable behavior. It contains instructions on how to ensure fair competition and anti-corruption, and gives concrete recommendations for actions.\n\nUnited Internet considers supply chain responsibility – especially in the areas of environmental protection, and labor and human rights – to be a material topic since it does business not only in its home market of Germany but also in other European countries and North America. Human rights comprise not only fundamental rights such as the rights to life, freedom, and equality, but also a wide range of aspects from the world of work, such as the prohibition on discrimination and (\"modern\") slavery, and the right to rest. Other aspects relate to the internet and the digital arena; these include freedom of opinion and information, and the protection of privacy.\n\nWhat is more, external regulatory factors are increasingly putting the spotlight on this topic and on the expectation that the Company will examine the way it works with business partners and suppliers. Measures such as the German government's National Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (\"NAP\") and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG), which entered into force in January 2023, should be mentioned here.\n\nThe basic principle regarding business partnerships and supplier relationships is that companies in Germany are subject to the same strict statutory requirements as United Internet itself. In addition, telecommunications is largely a regulated market. The integrity of United Internet's business partners is essential, since negative events could reflect on United Internet and hence lead to market and reputational risks.\n\n## Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/15 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background. In the upper left corner is the number 9 in white. Below the number, also in white, are the words \"INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE\" stacked on three lines. In the center of the icon is a white graphic of three cubes stacked together.\n\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.\n\nGRI 2-23\n\nGRI 2-24\n\nFor United Internet, responsible corporate governance does not stop at its own activities.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Responsible Corporate Management\n\n<span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>Material topic: Responsible corporate management\n\n[See the Articles of Asso](https://www.united-internet.de/fileadmin/pdf-xml/corporate-governance/2023/United_Internet_Statute_September_23_en.pdf)ciation on the United Internet website.\n\nGRI 2-9 GRI 2-23\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\n United Internet's corporate governance activities are based on the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) and on the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\"). The Supervisory Board and the Management Board provide information about the Company's corporate governance annually in their Corporate Governance Statement. The Company can depart from the Code's recommendations but is then required to disclose this every year in a declaration of compliance pursuant to section 161 of the AktG, and to provide a justification for this (\"comply or explain\").\n\nUnited Internet AG's Management Board and Supervisory Board consider it their duty to ensure the Group's continued existence, and to create sustainable value, by managing it responsibly and for the long term. For United Internet, running a business involves more than pursuing economic goals – the Company also sees itself as having an obligation to society, the environment, employees, and other stakeholders.\n\nAs early as May 2021, the Annual General Meeting expanded the Management Board remuneration system to include ESG criteria in the short-term variable remuneration that forms part of the performance-related remuneration components. This applies to new contracts of service with Management Board members and has been implemented in the target agreement process since fiscal year 2022. The target component is designed to focus Management Board members' attention on sustainability issues, and to create an incentive for addressing them. The compensation paid to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board is set out in the Remuneration Report, which is available on the website. Basic information can be found in United Internet AG's Articles of Association.\n\n## **Diversity of the Management Board and Supervisory Board**\n\n United Internet's diversity objective for the Management Board and Supervisory Board is for these bodies to include a wide variety of different people and, as a whole, to have a sufficient breadth of opinion and knowledge. Among other things, this requires the members of the individual bodies to complement each other with respect to their experience and their educational and professional backgrounds, so as to have a good understanding both of the Group's current business activities and of its longer-term opportunities and risks.\n\nFor information about United Internet AG's Management Board and the Supervisory Board, please see the chapter section of the United Internet Group's Management Report entitled \"Corporate Governance Statement.\"\n\nGRI 405-1\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/15 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of a computer mouse.

These are broken down in more detail and fleshed out in the Company's individual segments. For example, the Business Applications Segment supplements them with its Business Principles.\n\nOur values strengthen our self-\nimage and provide a framework for\nhow to act. Only a set of common\nbeliefs enable us to think and act\ntogether. Our values apply in our\ndealings with one another and with\ncustomers and business partners.\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nOur leadership philosophy is based\non making people successful.

It sets out shortly and\nsuccinctly how to act in compliance\nwith our values, the law, and our\nguidelines. It uses examples to\nillustrate key principles and make\nconcrete recommendations on how\nto deal with colleagues, business\npartners, investors, competitors,\ncustomers, and the media.\n\nGRI 2-23\n\nSee also \"Social Respon[sibility\" on page 45ff. for](#page-44-0)  further information on the corporate culture; and \"Supply Chain Re[sponsibility\" on page 24f.](#page-23-0)  for the Code of Conduct for Business Partners.\n\n[See the United Internet](https://www.united-internet.de/en/)  website.\n\nThe Corporate Values, Leadership Principles, and Code of Conduct are permanently available on the intranet and in some cases on the internet as well.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n The United Internet Group's risk and opportunities management policy aims to preserve and enhance the organization's assets by exploiting opportunities and identifying and managing risks at an early stage. Walking the talk in this way ensures that United Internet can do business in a controlled organizational environment. The policy sets out a responsible approach to dealing with the uncertainties that are an inevitable part of doing business. This also covers recruitment, staff development, and staff retention aspects, along with how to deal with environmental risks. For further information, please see the \"Risk, Opportunity, and Forecast Report\" in United Internet's Management Report.\n\nThe risk management processes and documentation were adapted in the 2023 reporting period to reflect the insights from the materiality analysis performed. One of the goals here is to enhance the visibility of those risks in the risk portfolio that are associated with sustainability topics and to harmonize the sustainability and risk management processes to a greater extent.\n\nGRI 2-12 GRI 2-13\n\n### GRI 201-2\n\nSee the \"Risk, Oppor[tunity, and Forecast Re](https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html)port\" in the Annual Report.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Compliance\n\n<span id=\"page-21-0\"></span>GRI 2-23 GRI 2-25 GRI 2-26 GRI 2-27\n\nGRI 205-2 GRI 205-3  For United Internet, compliance means observing all statutory requirements and internal organizational guidelines, and acting in accordance with the Corporate Values.\n\nUnited Internet is aware that breaches of statutory provisions and requirements do not just have legal consequences and run the risk of fines; they also entail a loss of trust placed in the Company by its shareholders, customers, business partners, and employees. United Internet AG's Management Board has established a Group-wide risk-based compliance management system (UI CMS) to preserve this trust and ensure compliance with statutory requirements and internal guidelines.\n\nThe UI CMS is described in the compliance guidelines. These binding Guidelines for the United Internet Group's Compliance Functions define the roles and responsibilities in the Group-wide, cross-segment Compliance organization. They are supplemented by a cooperation model, which is regularly updated and expanded to include new issues. The compliance guidelines underpin compliance policies that supplement and specify the requirements in more detail. Taken together, the compliance guidelines, the cooperation model, and the compliance policies that build on them to form the United Internet Group's compliance framework.\n\nThe overarching objective of all compliance activities is to prevent compliance violations. The aim is to achieve this by taking appropriate measures that are aligned with the Company's risk position. The three levels of activity – \"Prevent, Detect, and Respond\" – are observed in all cases.\n\nCorporate Compliance helps Group companies and segments to conduct their business activities in line with the rules. The focus is on anti-corruption, policy management, establishing confidential reporting channels, and protecting whistleblowers.\n\n## **Compliance Organization**\n\n The Group-wide compliance organization comprises the Corporate Compliance department at the level of the holding company plus local compliance units at segment level. One of Corporate Compliance's key tasks is to manage and monitor the Group-wide UI CMS; the detailed design of the segmentspecific CMSs takes place at Segment Compliance level.\n\nAt some subsidiaries, local compliance managers perform their role in addition to their other duties, while certain functions such as Human Resources (HR) have dedicated compliance managers to provide support.\n\nCorporate Compliance established a Group Compliance Committee during the reporting period. This serves as a platform for structural information sharing between Corporate Compliance and Segment Compliance with the goal of helping to give Compliance a \"uniform look\" throughout the Group and harmonizing ongoing development of the UI CMS. GRI 3-3\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nEU TAXONOMY\n\n CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY **Responsible Corporate Management**  Supply Chain Responsibility\n\n In addition, Corporate Compliance established a consultative Whistleblowing Committee in the reporting period, which meets on an ad hoc basis. The Whistleblowing Committee is responsible for assessing significant tip-offs regarding potential compliance violations, and makes recommendations on how to deal with such tip-offs. The Whistleblowing Committee is convened by the Segment Compliance Manager responsible and comprises representatives of Corporate Compliance and the Segment Compliance unit concerned, plus other relevant functions such as Corporate Audit or HR as required.\n\nThe Head of Corporate Compliance, representing the entire Group-wide Compliance organization, reports directly to the Group General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Audit and Risk Committee of United Internet AG's Supervisory Board.\n\n## **Anti-corruption**\n\n The Code of Conduct for employees is the foundation for behaving in line with the rules. It summarizes the main rules, explains them using examples, and gives concrete recommendations on how to act. At the same time, the Code refers to the key internal policies, offering employees a rapid overview. Among other things, the Code of Conduct for employees contains rules on anti-corruption. Building on the Corporate Value of \"fairness\", the Code of Conduct clearly sets out the measures taken to prevent corruption and uses concrete examples to explain what the Group means by anti-corruption.\n\nCorruption is not tolerated, regardless of where it happens, whom it targets, or what the reason for it is. In line with this, directly or indirectly offering or granting any form of undue benefits (bribery), and requesting or accepting such benefits (corruption), are prohibited. An e-learning course is used to familiarize employees with the content of the Code of Conduct in an interactive, easily understandable way. It is an integral part of the onboarding process for new staff. In addition, new employees in Germany are made aware of the importance of compliance issues \"face to face\" during the virtual \"welcome days\" for compliance.\n\nThese basic rules are set out in more detail in the internal Anti-corruption Policy. The policy is supplemented by confidential personal reporting channels and IntegrityLine, an electronic whistleblower system. These reporting channels provide employees with confidential contact points outside their immediate working environment.\n\nBoth event-driven and activity-based measures are used to benchmark whether the compliance goals have been met. The event-driven KPIs include both the number of tip-offs regarding potential compliance violations and the number of confirmed cases. A thorough review of all reports received did not reveal any incidents of bribery or corruption in the 2023 reporting period, as had also been the case in 2022.\n\nThe activity-based KPIs include the participation rate for the e-learning course on the Code of Conduct (referred to as the \"e-learning course\" for short).\n\nA total of 1,405 new staff were invited to take the e-learning course in the 2023 reporting period, while 1,142 (2022: 1,546) employees(1) have successfully completed it. This corresponds to a ratio of 81.3% (2022: 77.6%) of new recruits in the Corporate, Consumer Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments in the reporting period who were still active as of December 31, 2023. As a result, the target ratio of 80% was achieved.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>Material topic: Supply chain responsibility\n\nSee United Internet's [Policy Statement.](https://www.united-internet.de/fileadmin/company/verantwortung/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Human_Rights_United_Internet_EN.pdf) \n\n# Supply Chain Responsibility\n\n Supply chain responsibility is an important way of ensuring sustainable Group value creation above and beyond its own operations, and hence making a further contribution to the environment and society. Business relationships that are built around close partnerships are the basis for successful cooperation, and for a resilient and sustainable supply chain. This topic has become even more important given the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG).\n\nUnited Internet described the approach and the processes it has put in place to implement the LkSG in a Policy Statement during the reporting period. A dedicated report is used to report on compliance with the due diligence requirements set out in the LkSG.\n\n## Description of the Supply and Value Chain\n\n United Internet is an access and applications provider that supplies consumers and businesses with internet-based applications – both as independent products in the Applications Division and in combination with fixed network and mobile access products in the Access Division. The United Internet Group sees its role as being to examine and positively influence its impact on the environment and society in all links in its value chain.\n\nThe following graphic shows a simplified overview of the United Internet Group's supply and value chain:\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/7 description: The image shows a value chain diagram. The first step is \"Raw materials\". The second step is \"Wholesale services\" which includes \"Devices/products, network services\". The third step is \"Our value added\" which includes \"Access and applications (information, communication, entertainment)\". The fourth step is \"Distribution\" which includes \"Sales, shipping, servicing\". The fifth step is \"Use of products and services\". The sixth step is \"End of use\" which includes \"Disposal/recycling\".\n\n## **Upstream**\n\n United Internet sources network services, domains, licenses, and ICT products such as devices and servers from the upstream value chain. In turn, these wholesale services are based in some cases on a multistage upstream value chain stretching all the way back to raw materials extraction.\n\nThe wholesale services provided for the Access Division – and especially network services (mobile and fixed network) – represent a significant component of total wholesale services. Until 1&1 started providing mobile services via its own network, it had access to Telefónica's mobile network in Germany in the reporting period and also used capacity provided by other wholesale service providers such as Vodafone's mobile network. 1&1 started successively migrating existing customers using these networks to the 1&1 mobile network since the end of 2023.\n\nServers and devices such as smartphones and tablets, which are sourced from international manufacturers, have an environmental impact. In particular, their electronic components can be relevant from the raw materials extraction phase onwards.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nEU TAXONOMY\n\n CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Responsible Corporate Management **Supply Chain Responsibility** \n\n The social and environmental perspective is especially relevant here, since raw materials in particular are frequently mined in countries in which the standards for working conditions and environmental protection alike are lower than in Germany, for example. United Internet analyzes these human rights and environmental risks continuously as part of the risk analyses it performs for suppliers, countries of origin, and product groups.\n\n## **United Internet's Value Added**\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram with five red squares arranged in a circular pattern around the text \"Data centers fiber-optic network\" in the center. The squares are labeled \"Customer care\", \"Product development/enhancement\", \"Marketing\", \"Sales\", and \"Logistics\". An arrow indicates the flow from \"Customer care\" to \"Product development/enhancement\", then to \"Marketing\", \"Sales\", \"Logistics\", and back to \"Customer care\".\n\n The figure provides a more detailed breakdown of the red link entitled \"United Internet's value added\" in the value chain shown earlier. United Internet primarily adds value in the areas of product development and enhancement, marketing, sales, and customer care. In addition, the Group has its own logistics capabilities. Its products and services are based around the operation of its own data centers and fiber-optic networks.\n\nUnited Internet adds most of the value it creates in Germany or in other EU or OECD countries. Impacts on the environment and society, such as the energy consumed by data centers, the impact of transportation and logistics, or United Internet's responsibility as an employer, are exam-\n\nined in detail in the relevant chapters of this sustainability report. In addition, potential human rights and environmental risks are assessed across all locations using dedicated risk analyses.\n\n## **Downstream**\n\n United Internet also uses service providers to perform some parts of its sales and customer service operations. Downstream activities can be highly relevant, since in many cases the contracts underlying the fee-based subscriptions (more than 28 million) and ad-financed free accounts (roughly 40 million) result in long-term customer relationships. This means that the use phase for products (e.g., with respect to data privacy and information security) is a material part of the business – including from a sustainability perspective.\n\nEqually, environmental topics are relevant. Deliveries and journeys by service providers use fuel and emit greenhouse gases. In addition, disposing of or recycling retired devices and IT equipment in an environmentally friendly manner is a relevant environmental factor, which is why United Internet works with specialized business partners in this area.\n\n[See the \"Digital Responsi](#page-28-0)bility\" chapter on page 29ff.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Responsibility for Human Rights Due Diligence and Environmental Due Diligence\n\n United Internet is aware of its responsibility for people and the environment, and lives up to its social responsibility. This applies both to its own operations and to its supply chain. United Internet shares responsibility for compliance with human rights and environmental due diligence requirements with its business partners and makes this the basis of cooperation, so as to build reliable, long-term relationships and assume responsibility together.\n\n## **Risk Management – Structures and Responsibilities**\n\n United Internet ensures compliance with human rights and environmental due diligence requirements, both in its own operations and in its supply chain, by embedding workflows and responsibilities in its core business processes. Among other things, this includes appointing a central Human Rights Officer to monitor risk management, plus human rights coordinators in relevant functions such as Procurement, Human Resources, and Sustainability. These are responsible for coordinating implementation of the due diligence requirements in the relevant business processes at the level of the individual functions.\n\n## **Risk Analysis**\n\n United Internet has developed policies for analyzing human rights and environmental risks in its own operations and in its supply chain. These risk analysis policies were used by the functions and organizational units affected in the 2023 reporting period as the basis for analyzing potential risks at their own locations and within the supply chain. These risk analyses will be integrated in the organization and, to a certain extent, in the systems used and will be performed annually and ad hoc going forward.\n\n- A questionnaire and a related assessment policy were developed for use in risk analyses of United Internet's own operations, allowing it to determine, weight, and prioritize human rights and environmental risks. The individual risk categories are assessed for each location or location cluster by the contacts in the functions concerned, based on the probability of occurrence determined for them and their expected severity (impact, scope, irreversibility). A variety of assessment categories are taken into account, such as the existence of a certified management system, clear roles and responsibilities, procedural instructions, established processes and practices, and KPIs and reporting structures. The results of the risk analysis are fed into United Internet's corporate decision-making processes on an ongoing basis and serve as the basis for identifying appropriate goals and targets, and preventive and corrective measures.\n- A proven software solution is used to perform risk analyses in the supply chain; this is initially being used to assess the country and sector risks with respect to human rights, environmental, and ethical risks. This abstract (gross) risk analysis is then used to determine and prioritize potential high-risk suppliers. These \"gross risk suppliers\" are then discussed by the human rights coordinators in the Procurement department and the purchasing agents responsible for the suppliers concerned. The dialog covers both the gross risk identified and the existing and future preventive measures taken or to be taken in response to them.\n\nA net risk assessment of the suppliers is then performed, taking established preventive measures into account, after which additional preventive measures are determined. In addition, insights gained in the course of the grievance procedure are included in the risk analysis.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nResponsible\n\n**Supply Chain** \n\n27\n\n## **Preventive and Corrective Measures**\n\n A large number of measures have been systematically incorporated into the workflows in United Internet's own operations. Among other things, this applies to the Human Resources function's processes, procedural instructions, and responsibilities. These cover human rights due diligence requirements such as the prohibition on child labor and forced labor, ensuring appropriate remuneration and working conditions, and nondiscrimination of employees. Measures include appropriate contracts of employment, audits of temporary employment agencies, regular salary reviews and minimum wage audits, internal remuneration guidelines, internal audits, and regular training on diversity and equal opportunities. For example, occupational health and safety issues are addressed using annual safety inspections and regular classroom training and safety courses.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\n**Responsibility** \n\nCorporate Management\n\n#### Internal Code of Conduct\n\n United Internet AG's Code of Conduct sets out rules for how the Group and its employees should behave, and covers human rights and environmental due diligence requirements in its own operations. The Code of Conduct has been implemented at all United Internet AG companies and is binding on all employees. An e-learning course on the Code of Conduct is used to familiarize employees with its content in an interactive, easily understandable way, and is an integral part of the onboarding process.\n\n#### Code of Conduct for Business Partners\n\n The Code of Conduct for United Internet AG's Business Partners (or the \"Code of Conduct for Business Partners\" for short) sets out the minimum requirements that must be observed by United Internet's suppliers. United Internet expects that business partners will also pass on the standards set out in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners to their own suppliers. The Code specifies how the requirements are to be met and draws attention to the established grievance procedure for reporting any potential violations. For example, United Internet provides employees at its business partners who want to notify it of potential violations (especially in the areas of human rights and the environment) with a confidential reporting channel.\n\n#### Supplier management\n\n United Internet is systematically expanding its supplier management. A dedicated software solution is used to assess suppliers for potential sustainability risks, and sustainability impact assessments are then performed on a risk- and event-driven basis. In future, the supplier management process will specifically address human rights and environmental risks in the supply chain. This will cover supplier selection on the basis of defined requirements and qualification criteria, supplier assessment and control, and supplier development.\n\nSee also the \"Compli[ance\" section on page 22.](#page-21-0) \n\nGRI 308-1 GRI 408-1 GRI-409-1 GRI 414-1 GRI 414-2\n\n[See the Code of Conduct](https://www.united-internet.de/fileadmin/company/verantwortung/Supplier_Code_of_Conduct_United_Internet_AG.pdf)  for Business Partners.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Grievance Process**\n\n United Internet has established confidential reporting channels to enable risks and adverse impacts to be identified at an early stage. By appointing compliance managers and designated persons of trust, the Group has created confidential points of contact outside of the immediate working environment. These personal reporting channels are supplemented by an electronic whistleblowing system that enables whistleblowers to remain anonymous if desired.\n\nThe goal of these grievance mechanisms is to become aware of any human rights complaints at an early stage and to get to the bottom of all complaints regarding human rights violations. The Management Board is informed every quarter of human right complaints, incidents, and material adverse impacts as part of compliance reporting.\n\nGroup Compliance received eight reports of possible violations with potentially adverse human rights impacts in fiscal year 2023. All of these underwent a plausibility check.\n\nViolations were found to have occurred in two cases, and corrective actions were launched and implemented in both of these. No violations were found to have occurred in six cases, and no further measures were required with respect to these.\n\n## **Policy Statement**\n\n[See the UN Guiding Prin](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)ciples.\n\n United Internet is committed to observing the United Nations' Universal Declaration on Human Rights and bases its activities on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. United Internet has included principles designed to ensure respect for human rights in its Corporate Values and Code of Conduct. This applies both to its internal Code of Conduct for employees and to its Code of Conduct for Business Partners.\n\n[See United Internet AG's](https://www.united-internet.de/fileadmin/company/verantwortung/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Human_Rights_United_Internet_EN.pdf)  Policy Statement.\n\nUnited Internet AG's senior management published a Policy Statement in the reporting period. This describes the Group's approach to implementing the human rights and environmental due diligence requirements set out in the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG), and covers its human rights strategy and what it expects from employees and business partners.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nN TAXONOMY\n\n29\n\n<span id=\"page-28-0\"></span> DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY Digital Participation Information Security Data Privacy\n\n# DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n The \"Digital Responsibility\" chapter covers the material topics of digital participation, information security, and data privacy.\n\nAs an internet specialist, United Internet is laying the foundations for the digital transformation of the economy and society. The Group aims to enable everyone to participate in the digitalization process, and to that they can do this securely and accessibly. From an information security and data privacy perspective, the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information have top priority. United Internet considers data privacy to be an inalienable basic right. In line with this, enabling customers to decide for themselves just how their data should be handled and protected is part of United Internet's DNA.\n\nUnited Internet's aim is to enable everyone to participate in the digitalization process, and to ensure that they can do this securely.\n\nThe material topics discussed in this chapter are closely linked to the individual segments' business models. For this reason, the management board members for the segments concerned are directly responsible for digital responsibility.\n\n## Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/13 description: The image shows three sustainable development goals. The first goal is \"Quality Education\", which is goal number 4. The description for this goal is \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\" The second goal is \"Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\", which is goal number 9. The description for this goal is \"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.\" The third goal is \"Partnerships for the Goals\", which is goal number 17. The description for this goal is \"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.\"\n\n# Digital Participation\n\n Digitalization is transforming both the economy and society. Numerous initiatives are currently addressing the framework for digital transformation at the political, civil society, and business levels. United Internet is convinced of the need for everyone to be able to participate in the digitalization process. In addition, topics such as freedom of opinion and information, the protection of privacy, and the right to participate in cultural life are now inextricably linked with the digital space. Consequently, the internet and the digital transformation process also play a critical role with respect to human rights.\n\nMaterial topic: Digital participation \n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n As a European internet specialist, United Internet sees its role as building bridges to a digital future. Its goal is to offer consumers and companies broadband internet access and powerful cloud applications, providing full and secure access to the numerous opportunities offered by the internet as a universal infrastructure for information, communication, entertainment, and e-business. United Internet's Consumer Access, Business Access, Consumer Applications and Business Applications segments aim to contribute actively to ensuring that everybody can participate freely in the digital transformation process, and to give them the space and opportunity to roam the internet safely and confidently. The ability to control one's own data is part of this digital sovereignty. Customer security when using its products and services is paramount for United Internet.\n\n## Germany's Fourth Mobile Network\n\n United Internet's subsidiary 1&1 AG successfully participated in Germany's 5G frequency auction in the summer of 2019, laying the foundations for constructing the country's fourth mobile network. As a new network operator, 1&1 has focused right from the start on innovative OpenRAN technology – a fully virtualized mobile network in the private cloud. United Internet had already proven that Open-RAN technology works by launching its network in December 2022. This was when the Company went live with its \"5G at home\" service – a 5G fixed network product implemented using mobile technology – at its first mast locations. The next step in December 2023 was to go live with the mobile services needed for smartphone usage. This means that the technology for German's fourth mobile network is now fully operational.\n\n## OpenRAN Technology\n\n 1&1 is building Europe's most modern 5G network on the basis of innovative OpenRAN technology. In contrast to traditional network architectures, the OpenRAN approach makes a strict distinction between software and hardware. All network functions for 1&1's OpenRAN reside in the private cloud and are managed at the software level. Regional edge data centers are connected to the mast locations, which are a maximum of 10 kilometers away, via fiber-optic cables. Applications running on this infrastructure benefit from extremely short transmission routes. All masts are connected by fiber-optic cables and equipped with gigabit antennas.\n\nAnother key advantage of OpenRAN technology is its large partner ecosystem. Clearly defined, standardized interfaces in 1&1's OpenRAN permit flexible cooperation with different manufacturers on the market. In addition, the aim is to ensure efficient network operation by systematically separating software and hardware. The decentralized network infrastructure allows capacity to be adapted as needed to local use frequency. Among other things, this includes automatically switching off servers, antenna components, or entire cells when loads are low (e.g., in industrial estates at night). Cell loads are calculated continuously and predictive power-off mechanisms are activated automatically.\n\nAs is the case with conventional mobile networks, ensuring the security of OpenRAN networks requires in-depth risk analysis and continuous monitoring of all security-related criteria. 1&1 commissioned its equipment supplier Rakuten, which operates an ISO 27001-certified security management system, to perform detailed risk analyses. The Company welcomes the study by the BSI (Germany's Federal Office for Information Security) on security in OpenRAN mobile networks and the security recommendations that this contains, and is in regular contact with the authority. In addition, 1&1 is a member of the international O-RAN Alliance, whose expert bodies analyze the security of OpenRAN technology in depth, and continuously enhance it.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **A**\n\n44\n\nPrivacy by design: Use of special technological design measures and/or default privacy settings to ensure compliance with data protection requirements (see also Article 25 of the GDPR).\n\n### Embedding data privacy expertise in the product development process\n\n The data privacy departments and data privacy coordinators serve as internal consultants for data privacy questions that arise, for example, during product design or development (\"privacy by design\" or \"privacy by default\") or in relation to contractual agreements.\n\n### Comprehensive, easy-to-understand rules\n\n United Internet's internal policies and processes facilitate compliance with data privacy requirements and best practices. Among other things, they specify the basic data privacy rules to be observed, how to use e-mail and the internet securely, and what to do in the case of external visitors to the Company's locations.\n\n### Regular data privacy training aids prevention\n\n United Internet wants each and every employee to help ensure that personal data is processed lawfully and in particular that sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands. To achieve this, it hold regular employee training courses.\n\n### Contact to the supervisory authorities\n\n The United Internet Group's data privacy departments are in regular contact with the competent data protection supervisory authorities; this applies in particular to dealing with customer concerns that have been passed on by the authorities. Set reporting and review processes have been defined for data privacy incidents. Where an obligation to report them exists, they are reported to the supervisory authorities. A total of 25 reports (2022: 36)(1) were made to the competent data protection supervisory authorities in 2023.\n\n### Complaints procedures aid effective detection\n\n Customer questions and complaints about data privacy are handled by trained staff in special data privacy teams, who work in close cooperation with the specialist data privacy units in the Group companies concerned. In addition, employees can contact the data privacy units or their data protection officer in confidence at any time to discuss data privacy issues arising in the course of their day-to-day work.\n\n### Checks to monitor effectiveness\n\n The United Internet Group's data privacy units are able and authorized to perform internal data privacy checks at any time. In addition, independent audit organizations can be commissioned as needed to perform external, objective data privacy audits in order to identify internal potential for improvement. The data privacy units are also entitled to check service providers and subcontractors in the course of their controls.\n\n### Technical safeguards enhance data privacy\n\n Customers trust United Internet with their personal data. The security standards that have been implemented at Group companies are constantly enhanced and improved to ensure that this data is protected.\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> Including Consumer Access, Business Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications. The data for the Business Applications segments only contains reports by IONOS SE.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nTAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nDiversity and\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span> **Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy** \n\nTraining and Education\n\nRecruiting and Retaining\n\nEqual Opportunities Occupational Health andSafety, and HealthManagement\n\nYoung Talent Social Commitment\n\nl Commitment\n\nUnited Internet aims to be a fair and attractive em-\n\nployer.\n\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY GRI 3-3\n\n The \"Social Responsibility\" chapter comprises the following material topics: working conditions and diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility. The first topic is presented in the \"Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\" section. In addition, this chapter reports on training and education, recruiting and retaining young talent, occupational health and safety and health management, and United Internet's social commitment.\n\nUnited Internet aims to be a fair and attractive employer. In line with this, it regularly improves its employees' working conditions and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion (with a focus on accessibility issues). In addition, United Internet aims to fully live up to its social responsibility in the working environment by offering wide-ranging training and continuous professional development opportunities, and champions compliance with occupational health and safety requirements. United Internet's qualified staff are a key factor in its success. Their specialist knowledge and technological expertise enable them to rise to the challenges posed every day by the rapid pace of change and the short innovation cycles in the internet and telecommunications sector. United Internet also attaches great importance to making a social commitment and supporting social projects above and beyond its own internal activities, including by leveraging its strong brands with their substantial reach.\n\nUnited Internet's ability to meet its short-, medium-, and long-term staffing requirements and to ensure that the Group has the necessary specialist skills is critically important. Should it fail to do this, United Internet might not be able to do business effectively, or to achieve its growth targets, in the future any longer.\n\nThe topics mentioned above are largely managed independently within the segments, and consequently the segment management board members are responsible for them.\n\n# Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nImage /page/44/Figure/19 description: The image shows three sustainable development goals. The first goal is quality education, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The second goal is gender equality, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. The third goal is decent work and economic growth, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\n\n<span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Material topic: Working conditions\n\n> United Internet aims to be a fair and attractive employer. Its goal is to recruit managers and employees with specialist skills and technological know-how, to support their continuing development, and to retain them at the Company.\n\n> One core principle of its human resources work is always to see its staff as individuals first, and not just as employees. It creates a high-performance corporate culture by ensuring that its Corporate Values are reflected in strategically important human resources issues such as compensation, continuing education and training, and occupational safety. Regular dialogs are held with the Management Board on these issues.\n\n> In addition to the Group's general, overarching strategy, the Access and Applications divisions and the individual segments within them pursue specific human resources strategies. United Internet has established centralized, topic-specific centers of competence to regulate overarching HR governance issues and offer Group-wide services, allowing requirements and staffing levels to be coordinated at Group and divisional level. This ensures an overarching approach and equal treatment on the one hand, while also freeing up the segments to focus squarely on their operational business.\n\n> Responsibility for key elements of human resources development, recruitment, and HR marketing has been transferred to the segments concerned, guaranteeing this operational focus and ensuring that the HR strategy in the segments is close to the business. By contrast, the core \"UI Learning and Organizational Development\" center of competence promotes topics such as continuous professional development and learning on a Group-wide basis so as to provide a framework for knowledge sharing, innovation, and productivity. This helps foster new ideas and innovative potential, enhances the Group's competitiveness, and offers opportunities for all.\n\n[See also the \"Focus Goal:](#page-54-0)  Equal Opportunities and Gender Balance\" section on page 55f.\n\nGRI 401-1\n\nUnited Internet aims to offer tailored personal development formats, recruit managers from within the organization, and retain employees for the long term. Metrics used to track effectiveness include the management positions that have been filled internally (2023: 62.6%; 2022: 66.2%)1 and the staff turnover rate (2023: 7.5%; 2022: 9.8%).(2) In addition, the Company has set itself the goal of appointing more women to management positions.\n\nThe following tables give a breakdown of the workforce by location (Germany and abroad) and segment:\n\n| Employees by location (Germany and abroad) (1) | 2021  | ✓ 2022 | ✓ 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Germany                                        | 8,199 | 8,550  | 8,981  |\n| Abroad                                         | 1,776 | 1,924  | 1,981  |\n| Total employees                                | 9,975 | 10,474 | 10,962 |\n\n(1) The figures relate to active employees as of December 31 of the fiscal year concerned.\n\n(2) The figures relate to the number of active core employees, i.e., active employees including apprentices and trainees, but not including student workers, interns, school students, thesis students, and temporary staff, and staff with inactive employment contracts (mainly employees on parental leave).\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> The figures relate to the number of active core employees, i.e., active employees including apprentices and trainees, but not including student workers, interns, school students, thesis students, and temporary staff, and staff with inactive employment contracts (mainly employees on parental leave).\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE         | EU TAXONOMY | CORPORATE<br>RESPONSIBILITY | DIGITAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY | SOCIAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY                           |       | ENVIRONMENTAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY                           |\n|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                         |             |                             |                           |                                                    |       |                                                           |\n|                         |             |                             |                           | Working Conditions and<br>Human Resources Strategy |       | Diversity and<br>Equal Opportunities                      |\n|                         |             |                             |                           | Training and Education                             |       | Occupational Health<br>andSafety, and HealthMa<br>agement |\n|                         |             |                             |                           | Recruiting and Retaining<br>Young Talent           |       | Social Commitment                                         |\n| Employees by segment(1) |             |                             | 2021                      | 2022                                               | 2023  |                                                           |\n| Consumer Access         |             |                             | 3,167                     | 3,163                                              | 3,320 |                                                           |\n| Business Access         |             |                             | 1,238                     | 1,336                                              | 1,522 |                                                           |\n| Consumer Applications   |             |                             | 1,004                     | 1,036                                              | 1,072 |                                                           |\n| Business Applications   |             |                             | 3,998                     | 4,247                                              | 4,364 |                                                           |\n| Corporate HQ            |             |                             | 568                       | 692                                                | 684   |                                                           |\n\n(1) The figures relate to active employees as of December 31 of the fiscal year concerned.\n\n## Values and Corporate Culture\n\n United Internet's Corporate Values and Leadership Principles make up its system of values. The Code of Conduct shows how staff act in line with them. All employees are provided with the system of values and the Code of Conduct when they join. The employee onboarding procedure also refers to both documents.\n\n**Total employees 9,975 10,474 10,962** \n\nManagers are prepared for their responsibility as role models, so to ensure the Group also walks the talk with its values in its day-to-day work. This responsibility is set out in the Leadership Principles, which are currently broken down in greater detail in individual segments, for example in IONOS's Business Principles. Small groups of managers discuss the meaning of leadership in the two-monthly (virtual) manager onboarding meetings, and break this down to establish what this means for their day-to-day work.\n\nManagement Board members from the individual divisions kick off the topic, and actively reach out to new managers on it.\n\nIt is then discussed in more detail and put in an operational context in the obligatory four-part \"Leadership Training – Leadership Foundations\" program, which all new managers are required to take.\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/7 description: The image is a red logo for \"Top Employer Deutschland Germany 2023\". The logo is a red rectangle with rounded corners. On the left side of the rectangle is the word \"top\" in white letters, with the \"o\" in \"top\" having a registered trademark symbol. Below the word \"top\" is the word \"EMPLOYER\" in white letters. On the right side of the rectangle is the word \"DEUTSCHLAND\" above the word \"GERMANY\" above the number \"2023\", all in white letters. Below the rectangle is the phrase \"CERTIFIED EXCELLENCE IN EMPLOYEE CONDITIONS\" in white letters.\n\nUnited Internet uses assessments by external institutions and independent sector rankings in addition to internal surveys so as to obtain as objective a view as possible of its activities in the staff and management area. In 2023, the Top Employers Institute again recognized United Internet as a \"Top Employer\"\n\n– an accolade it has received every year for more than a decade. This certification is awarded to companies that offer their employees attractive working conditions. Criteria used in the evaluation are career opportunities, employer benefits, working conditions, and training and development opportunities.\n\n## **Fair Remuneration**\n\n Paying employees fairly and in line with performance is an important part of United Internet's human resources strategy. The aim is to provide staff with market-driven, fair, and transparent compensation and benefits that are aligned with corporate strategy. The internal compensation policy forms the basis for United Internet's comparable, fair, and legally compliant compensation system. This document defines the rules and procedures to be observed throughout the Group when making salary adjustments.\n\nSome positions and levels of responsibility offer performance-based variable compensation components. In addition, United Internet offers employees in Germany a number of benefits above and beyond the financial compensation it pays; these include a company pension, capital formation benefits, prevention programs forming part of the occupational health system, and discounts on the Company's products.\n\nfile\\_document\n\n[See also the \"Values and](#page-20-0)  Principles\" section on page 21.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-47-0\"></span> The salaries paid, and the way in which these progress over time, are independent of employees' gender or other factors that are not related to the position in question or the skills required. Fair, appropriate compensation is ensured by comparing functions internally at least every six months, taking market developments and analyses into account, and consulting external benchmarks. To do this, the salaries for more than 7,000 staff in six countries are compared with benchmark data on normal market remuneration from a well-known survey provider, which is updated every year. The results of the comparison are made available to the HR business partners and are used as input in the salary formation process for both regular salary reviews and extraordinary salary adjustments.\n\nCivil society organizations and NGOs have noted that companies in the Philippines frequently do not pay the minimum wage. Regular salary reviews are intended to ensure that Group staff in Cebu are paid more than the minimum wage.\n\n## Training and Education\n\n## Development and Prospects\n\nGRI 404-2\n\n[See the \"Locations\" sec](https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html)tion in United Internet AG's Annual Report.\n\n> United Internet's human resources and organizational development motto is \"We empower our staff, managers, and experts to do their best for the Company's success.\" In a dynamic, constantly changing market, this means that managers and employees have to take responsibility both for their work and for their personal development. United Internet is convinced that workforce motivation and determination to succeed depend on employees' ability to see and pursue individual prospects for themselves. Continuous development on the part of individual employees also grows the knowledge available to the organization as a whole. For example, keeping abreast of the state of the art in the areas of information security and software development protects the Company's technology lead, while professional customer care helps enhance customer satisfaction and retention.\n\n> United Internet therefore invests in wide-ranging learning and development measures and ensures its employees grow in line with the functions they perform. Activities here are based on employees' individual \"development journeys.\" These are agreed during annual staff performance reviews and their implementation is then monitored over the course of the year.\n\n> Among other things, staff development plans include the concrete skills needed to perform upcoming tasks, suitable on-the-job or off-the-job measures, and employees' personal development wishes and preferences. This boosts both employees' individual responsibility and their willingness to learn, and also ensures they can learn new things at every stage of their development. The pronounced feedback culture raises their awareness of the necessity for lifelong learning and also enhances their motivation to develop further. Within the Company, employees have the opportunity to use a regular, structured, systematic process for their performance reviews and also to obtain additional feedback themselves. In addition, managers at the independently run companies in particular hold individual development reviews with employees. This option raises awareness of the need for openness and reflection throughout the entire organization. As a result, feedback becomes a natural part of everyday work and can be used for continuous personal development.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Training and Education**\n\n#### SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\n\n Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\n\nDiversity and Equal Opportunities Occupational Health andSafety, and HealthManagement\n\n Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent Social Commitment\n\nSocial Commitment\n\nGRI 404-2\n\n**Personal Development Opportunities** \n\n#### **Campus**\n\nThe UI-Campus, United Internet's learning management platform, pools internal courses, training, and e-learning modules, giving staff quick, easy, and transparent access to development opportunities within the organization. The internal campus provides employees with an intuitive learning experience and makes it easy to search for training courses and further education offerings. In this way, United Internet offers employees and managers from all areas of the organization a wide range of training options in the areas of methodologies, soft skills, and professional knowledge. In 2023, the learning offerings were restructured to introduce learning paths. The move gives all learners maximum transparency about their booking status and allows them to see how far they have come on their learning journey at any time.\n\nAll courses are assessed for participant satisfaction and recommendation rates to ensure continuous improvement of the offering. The average score for both categories on a scale of one to ten was more than eight points in the reporting period, an indication of the high quality of the courses provided.\n\nIn addition to the interdisciplinary courses run by People & Organizational Development for all employees and managers, the courses on offer include training for segment-specific customer care units, courses from a technical training catalog, and other specialist training. The training program also includes training on internal tools, processes, and methodologies. These courses are offered by employees with the relevant in-depth specialist knowledge for other employees. This encourages knowledge sharing and learning from one another.\n\n## **Specific Development Programs for New Recruits and Young Talent**\n\nTalent development programs aim to facilitate proactive personal development. This is why individual development plans are aligned with the target positions concerned.\n\n- \"MyWayTo\" enables junior managers to design their careers as people managers or experts in a way that is both in line with United Internet's Corporate Values and reflects their individual preferences. This is achieved by combining mandatory basic modules with elective add-ons. Its success is due to participants' commitment to the program, the support provided by HR, and the managers' integration in development planning. Thanks to these measures, among other things, it was possible to fill 62.6% of management positions internally in 2023.\n- United Internet's \"Navigate\" program is designed to retain highly motivated high performers for the Company early on. The program supports them in their development over the course of a year, strengthening their entrepreneurial mindset and skills, powers of reflection, and ability to give and take feedback, among other things. The goal is to develop participants' individual personal skills. A wide network of role models drawn from within the Company demonstrates different career development paths and reflects in particular on what it means to take responsibility. This gives participants concrete experience of the personal development opportunities on offer.\n- The \"Women explore\" program focuses on raising women's visibility within the Company, helping them to network and share information more with one another, and supporting them in actively examining their personal strengths and their career and networking strategies.\n- The Discovery & Development Camp helps long-term senior staff to develop within their roles, enabling them to position themselves, their specialist and methodological knowledge, and their expertise within the Company and increasing their visibility.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Outlook**\n\nA two-day internal conference devoted to learning – \"Learning Days\" – was held in the 2023 reporting period. In the previous year, this initiative had been organized by an enterprise-wide project team, \"Initiative Learning Culture,\" and focused on the \"learning organization.\" More than 30 colleagues from the Company helped make the conference a success. Nearly 1,500 staff from across the enterprise took part in the two virtual days, which combined short talks and reports on lessons learned from employees with contributions by external lecturers and speakers. Building on the conference, new learning formats and offerings for all Company employees were developed over the rest of the year. This development will be continued in 2024. Going forward, the goal is to make learning at United Internet more varied and more versatile by increasing the flexibility of training and learning formats and offering a growing number of short talks that can be integrated with listeners' day-to-day work. In addition, 2024 will see the launch of enterprise-wide \"LinkedIn Learning.\" This will serve as a supplement to classic training courses, giving the organization's staff the opportunity to expand their skills and competencies through online video tutorials. Other focus topics for 2024 are establishing and expanding expertise in the area of digitalization and enhancing management skills with respect to people management, product-related, and specialist management.\n\n## Training and Education in Figures\n\nThe following table shows the training and education figures recorded for the last three years:\n\n| Training and education hours                              | 2021    | ✓ 2022(1) | ✓ 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Training and education hours per year (employees)         | 124,799 | 102,470   | 105,301 |\n| Training and education hours per employee (2)             | 12.5    | 9.8       | 9.6     |\n| Training and education hours per year (service providers) | 57,414  | 58,538    | 115,143 |\n\n(1) The calculation methodology was corrected for the 2022 reporting period. A full direct comparison to previous years is not possible since a broader definition was used in previous years. The figures for these previous years cannot be analyzed and recalculated retrospectively since new analysis capabilities only became available as from the 2022 reporting period.\n\n(2) The figure relates to all active United Internet Group employees (2023: 10,962; 2022: 10,474; 2021: 9,975).\n\nIn addition, United Internet's employees attended a total of 906 external training courses, seminars, and conferences of varying lengths during the reporting period (2022: 560). The increase is primarily due to the fact that the subsidiaries in the Business Applications Segment were able to access these offerings for the first time during the reporting period. In addition, new training courses were created, and employees made greater use of the \"Learning Days\" and \"Lunch & Learn\" offerings.\n\nThe sharp rise in the number of education and training hours for service providers is due to the extensive courses given to new service provider staff in the Customer Care and Education Management areas.\n\nGRI 404-1\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nTraining and Education\n\n#### <span id=\"page-50-0\"></span> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\n\nDiversity and Equal Opportunities Occupational Health andSafety, and HealthManagement\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n **Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent** Social Commitment\n\nl Commitment\n\n# Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent\n\n## Initial Training and Education\n\nInitial vocational and professional training has a high priority for United Internet. The Company trains future staff and gives young people a successful start to their careers. At present, it offers apprenticeships for the following commercial and technical career profiles: computer science specialists (application development/systems integration), IT systems management specialists, dialog marketing specialists, marketing communications specialists, and office management specialists. In addition, United Internet and Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) offer degrees in computer science; business information systems; law, tax, and business/accounting & financial control; business administration/marketing management; and business administration/digital business management at the university's locations in Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, and Mannheim.\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/12 description: The image is a logo or emblem with a square shape and a gold and white color scheme. At the top of the logo, there are three stylized figures with their arms raised, resembling people or abstract shapes, colored in gold. Below these figures, the text \"BEST PLACE TO LEARN\" is written in a bold, sans-serif font, with \"BEST PLACE\" stacked above \"TO LEARN\". The text is in a dark gray or black color. Underneath this, there is a horizontal line separating the upper part of the logo from the lower part. Below the line, the text \"TOP-AUSBILDER\" is written in a similar bold, sans-serif font, also in dark gray or black. Underneath \"TOP-AUSBILDER\", there is a date range \"06/2020 - 05/2023\" written in a smaller font size, indicating a period of time. The background of the logo is white, except for the bottom part where the text \"TOP-AUSBILDER\" and the date range are, which is gold.\n\nAll program participants work in a wide range of different departments within the organization during their three-year apprenticeship or DHBW degree. They are fully integrated with the teams and day-to-day workflows during their time there. United Internet's unique vocational training model allows apprentices and dual degree students to actively design how they spend their time in the Company, i.e., they can choose the specialist departments that match their interests from their second year onwards. The apprentice\n\nworkshops at the Karlsruhe, Montabaur, and Munich locations are another major success. These are primarily used by technical apprentices, who spend an early part of their vocational training here to learn the basic skills that they will need later on when they are seconded to different departments within the organization. In addition to teaching specialist skills and methodologies, United Internet focuses during training on behavior that is in line with its system of values. This mix of technical know-how, methodological expertise, and conduct that adheres to the Company's values forms the basis for a successful transition to the world of work once apprentices are qualified. The vocational training time spent in the Company is supplemented by (cross-location) apprentice projects. One example here is apprentices' active contribution to, and design of, career orientation formats. As a result, apprentices completing United Internet's vocational training programs are excellently positioned to take up permanent positions later on. United Internet has held a \"Best Place to Learn\" accolade since June 2020 and was successfully recertified in 2023.\n\n As of December 31, 2023, there were 222 (2022: 211) young people in apprenticeships or studying throughout the Group. In the 2023 reporting period, 46 (2022: 40) freshly-qualified vocational trainees and students who had completed dual studies degrees or apprenticeships with the Company were offered permanent positions.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Attracting Young Talent\n\nUnited Internet works together with schools, universities, and colleges to attract fresh talent at an early stage. A variety of trainee programs were developed that offer an apprenticeship or a dual degree course (in cooperation with the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)) or help fresh graduates find their feet at the United Internet Group.\n\nSince 2021, United Internet has participated in Offenburg University's Mentoring Future program with the aim of supporting young female students, e.g., by offering them networking opportunities with young female employees and junior managers. The program provides for female staff from different United Internet departments to act as mentors for young women students. The feedback from the students confirms that the networking scheme has helped them transition between studying and work by providing insights into the process of starting one's career and professional issues.\n\nIn addition, United Internet launched a talent retention program in 2021 that allows interested applicants and prospective candidates – from school students to managers – to remain in contact with the Company.\n\nUnited Internet also has a special responsibility to its interns. As a signatory to the Fair Company Initiative, United Internet is committed to providing fair conditions such as appropriate compensation and personal support.\n\nSchool students can get to know United Internet and the world of work in general through short internships. United Internet cooperates and holds events with schools, as well as offering careers advice and career discovery opportunities during Germany's Girls'Day and Boys'Day, among other things.\n\nUnited Internet's apprentices also offer extremely popular one-week programming courses for children and young people aged 13 and over during vacations.\n\n[See Girls'Day and](https://www.bafza.de/engagement-und-aktionen/girlsday-und-boysday)  Boys'Day.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nU TAXONOMY\n\nDiversity and Equal Opportunities\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nTraining and Education\n\n#### <span id=\"page-52-0\"></span> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n**TY**\n\n Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\n\n**Diversity and Equal Opportunities**  Occupational Health andSafety, and HealthManagement\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nRecruiting and Retaining\nYoung Talent\n\nSocial Commitment\n\nRecruiting and Retaining\n\nYoung Talent Social Commitment\n\nMaterial topic: Diversity, inclusion, equity, and ac-\n\n[See Charta der Vielfalt.](https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/)\n\n Since 2020, United Internet's diversity measures have been coordinated and enhanced by a Groupwide project team lead by a central Diversity unit. United Internet signed up to Germany's Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter) in 2021, undertaking by doing so to create a nondiscriminatory working environment.\n\nThe project team works closely together with the \"queer.united,\" \"Part-time Initiative,\" \"Intercultural Community,\" and \"Cross-generational Cooperation\" employee diversity networks.\n\nA diversity strategy process was started in 2023. This resulted in a new diversity mission statement and three strategic focus goals for future diversity work. The process included specific survey results, Management Board and Supervisory Board interviews, and the results of the 2022 enterprise-wide employee diversity survey.\n\n#### Diversity Mission Statement\n\nHaving a workforce leveraging this diversity adds value for our success as a company and our corporate culture. We live up to our social responsibility and have a positive impact by promoting diversity.\n\nFor us, diversity affects the following dimensions: age, ethnic origin and nationality, gender and gender identity, physical and mental abilities, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation, and social origin.\n\nOur vision is for a nondiscriminatory diversity mindset to be part of our corporate DNA. This approach can be seen in both our working conditions and our dealings with customers.\n\nThe individual United Internet business segments are committed to maintaining and strengthening this awareness, e.g., by taking their own diversity measures with the goal of starting a discussion about diversity, promoting education on the topic, and building knowledge about it in the organization concerned. The aim is to understand and dismantle barriers to equal opportunities in the diversity dimensions mentioned.\n\nWe aim to learn from each other across segments, leverage synergies, and promote enterprise diversity networks.\n\nBecause creating diversity and living respectfully is everyone's responsibility. The Management Board and executives play their part as role models here.\n\n## Focus Goal: Diversity Mindset\n\n The importance of diversity is discussed during the onboarding events for new recruits and managers, and attention is drawn to the internal platform that provides information on all aspects of diversity. Here, employees and managers can find statements by the Management Board members on the topic, practical tips for ensuring a nondiscriminatory daily working environment, and numerous portraits of colleagues. The platform also contains enterprise-wide guidelines for ensuring nondiscriminatory, gender-sensitive visual imagery and language.\n\n53\n\n![]()\n\ncessibility\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nGRI 406-1\n\n[See \"Training and Educa-](#page-47-0)\n\ntion\", on page 48ff.\n\n United Internet will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying in the workplace. All staff are provided with personal, confidential contacts who/that can be reached online, such as Vertrauenspersonen (persons of trust), compliance managers, and the electronic whistleblower system. Any indications of discrimination are taken seriously and investigated: the Company is committed to swiftly getting to the bottom of all issues that are reported.\n\nIn 2023, United Internet took part for the third time in the \"German Diversity Day\" organized by Charta der Vielfalt e. V. and held its \"Diversity Days\" – a two-day virtual in-house conference – in May with almost 30 sessions on the topic. Among other things, the program featured keynote speeches by Management Board members, interactive workshops, reports by staff on their own experiences, and panel discussions. The feedback from the 700 or so employees who took part was extremely positive and it is planned to continue the format in 2024.\n\nUnited Internet won the \"Impact of Diversity\" award in the \"Best company\" category in 2023 for its Diversity Days format. This diversity prize is awarded every year by Impact of Diversity & Frauen-Karriere-Index for outstanding commitment to diversity. The jury chose to give the Impact of Diversity Awards to United Internet because the Diversity Days create an inclusive offering that enables staff to be heard and gives them the opportunity to highlight diversity issues.\n\nThe Diversity Days were flanked in the reporting period by open, virtual lectures (\"diversity keynotes\") by external diversity experts in German and English. One was on the overarching topic of \"discrimination-aware language\" and one on \"unleashing AI's potential with diversity in tech.\"\n\nSince 2022, managers throughout United Internet have been offered the opportunity to participate in a voluntary two-part diversity training course. In the first part of the course, managers are made aware of unconscious thought processes, while the second offers them help with developing an inclusive team and work culture in their areas of responsibility. A total of 18 managers took part in the training in 2023.\n\nIn addition, two e-learning courses aimed at managers were rolled out in the Business Applications Segment. The first module provides an overview of the topics of diversity and demonstrates its relevance in a corporate context. The second module looks at unconscious bias and its impact in work settings.\n\nHuman resources colleagues throughout the United Internet Group receive special training that aims to reduce the influence of unconscious bias and thought patterns across all HR processes, from recruitment down to talent management. A total of 61 employees were trained in 2023.\n\nLast but not least, cultural awareness and intercultural communication training is offered for the entire United Internet Group. English and German language courses are offered so as to ensure optimum communication on specialist subjects. In addition, all staff have access to an online language learning portal.\n\nDiversity training courses will be developed for all employees by 2025. These will be included in the onboarding process. The goal is to have trained at least 80% of the workforce (both employees and managers) by the end of 2025.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nTAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 55\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\n\nGRI 2-7 GRI 401-1\n\n<span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE | EU TAXONOMY | RESPONSIBILITY | RESPONSIBILITY |                                                    | RESPONSIBILITY                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |             |                |                | SOCIAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY                           |                                                             |\n|                 |             |                |                | Working Conditions and<br>Human Resources Strategy | Diversity and<br>Equal Opportunities                        |\n|                 |             |                |                | Training and Education                             | Occupational Health<br>and Safety, and<br>Health Management |\n|                 |             |                |                | Recruiting and Retaining<br>Young Talent           | Social Commitment                                           |\n\n## Focus Goal: Equal Opportunities and Gender Balance\n\n The United Internet Group defined a voluntary target for gender quotas in management positions in 2022, going above and beyond the requirements placed on United Internet AG by stock corporation law and the German Corporate Governance Code. This target was raised in 2023 in agreement with the Management Board. The aim is to have roughly 25% women in management positions on average by 2030. The current ratio is 21.2%; it includes all segments and applies to all management levels from the Management Board down to the third level below it.\n\nWomen accounted for 34.1% of new hires in the reporting period (2022: 32.7%) and 19.0% of newly recruited managers(1) (2022: 22.5%).\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of staff by gender and employment type.\n\n| Employees by gender(1) in % | 2021 | ✓ 2022 | ✓ 2023 |\n|-----------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Women                       | 32.3 | 32.1   | 32.1   |\n| Men                         | 67.7 | 67.9   | 67.8   |\n| Nonbinary                   | n/a. | n/a.   | 0.1    |\n\n(1) The figures relate to the core employees as of December 31 of the fiscal year concerned.\n\nIn addition, 11.5% (2022: 11.1%) of core employees worked part-time during the reporting period.\n\n| Employees by employment type, by gender(1) | 2021 |  2022 |  2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Women, full-time                           | 74.8 | 75.0   | 74.3   |\n| Men, full-time                             | 95.7 | 95.4   | 95.2   |\n| Nonbinary, full-time                       | n/a. | n/a.   | 100.0  |\n| Women, part-time                           | 25.2 | 25.0   | 25.7   |\n| Men, part-time                             | 4.3  | 4.6    | 4.8    |\n| Nonbinary, part-time                       | n/a. | n/a.   | 0.0    |\n\n(1) The figures relate to the core employees as of December 31 of the fiscal year concerned.\n\nFinally, the following table provides a breakdown of staff by gender and employment type.\n\n| Employees by employment contract and by region(1) | 2021 | ✓ 2022 | ✓ 2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Women, temporary employment contracts             | 5.0  | 3.4    | 3.1    |\n| Men, temporary employment contracts               | 7.3  | 6.5    | 5.7    |\n| Nonbinary, temporary employment contracts         | n/a. | n/a.   | 0.0    |\n| Women, permanent employment contracts             | 27.9 | 29.1   | 29.5   |\n| Men, permanent employment contracts               | 59.7 | 61.1   | 61.7   |\n| Nonbinary, permanent employment contracts         | n/a. | n/a.   | 0.1    |\n| Temporary employment contracts, Germany           | 11.1 | 9.3    | 8.5    |\n| Temporary employment contracts, outside Germany   | 1.2  | 0.6    | 0.3    |\n| Permanent employment contracts, Germany           | 71.1 | 72.3   | 73.5   |\n| Permanent employment contracts, outside Germany   | 16.6 | 17.8   | 17.8   |\n\n(1) The figures relate to all active employees in the United Internet Group as of December 31 of the fiscal year concerned.\n\n(1) The figures for InterNetX were not included when calculating the percentage of newly recruited managers who are women.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n United Internet starts actively promoting gender equality to school-age children, for example by taking part in Germany's national Girls'Day and Boys'Day or by offering school students programming courses. Dedicated measures designed to increase the number of women at United Internet were also taken in the 2023 reporting period as part of the Group's university and professional marketing activities. These included providing mentoring for female students at the University of Mannheim and attending careers and networking events specifically targeting women, such as \"Women in Business\" in Frankfurt and \"Women in Technology\" in Munich. In Germany, United Internet offers a talent and networking offering called \"Women explore,\" which won the 2020 HR Excellence Award in the \"Diversity and Female Empowerment\" category. A total of 49 women from all areas of the Company took part in the third round of the program that was held in 2023. \"Women explore\" aims to make high-potential women visible within the Company, to make it easier for them to network with one another, to allow them to specifically examine their strengths and their career and networking strategies, and to draw conclusions for the Company as whole. In addition, participants work on initiatives designed to promote gender equality, cross-enterprise networks, and diversity. Participation in the initiatives aims, for example, to facilitate formats for enabling explicit cultural dialog between the sexes or to intensify discussions about topics such as part-time working and cross-cultural exchange. \"Women explore\" has also established a pool of female role models who are available to act as discussion partners and mentors within the Company, and who demonstrate potential internal career paths for women at United Internet.\n\nTo mark International Women's Day on March 8, 2023, female managers and experts in Germany were invited to take part in the internal \"Women in Management Network\" event devoted to the relationship between sustainability and gender equality. Another, informal opportunity for female colleagues to get together in 2023 was the virtual \"Ladies Lunch\" format.\n\nEqual opportunities depend on all employees, regardless of their gender, being able to easily combine their family duties with their profession. With the exception of a few occupations, all staff in Germany can work remotely from home on two flexible \"cover days\" per week.(1)\n\nIn Germany, an external, independent employee assistance program offers tailor-made assistance where needed. Services include support with childcare (e.g., free emergency childcare places for children up to 12 years of age); vacation programs (including virtual formats); advice on the German statutory parental allowance, kindergartens, and the like; assistance with finding home helps; and advice on how to finance long-term care and in personal emergencies.\n\nIn addition, two presentations on \"work-life balance\" and a workshop analyzing the needs of fathers were held in 2023 and were very warmly received. As a result, the creation of a fathers' network and an expansion of the concrete benefits available to parents are currently being examined, so as to make it easier for staff to achieve a healthy work-life balance.\n\n(1) The cover day rule does not apply to 1&1 Versatel GmbH, STRATO AG, InternetX GmbH, Sedo Holding GmbH, united-domains AG, World4You Internet Services GmbH, we22 Aktiengesellschaft, home.pl S.A., or their respective subsidiaries.\n\n[See also \"Occupational](#page-56-0)  Health Management\n\n(OHM)\" on page 57ff.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nTAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n#### <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy Diversity and Equal Opportunities\n\n**Occupational Health andSafety, and HealthManagement** \n\n Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent Social Commitment\n\nSocial Commitment\n\n## Focus Goal: Inclusion and Accessibility\n\n United Internet has been addressing the issue of including people with visible and invisible disabilities since the last quarter of 2023. A cross-segment working group was set up for this comprising the HR, Sustainability and Facility functions. Among other things, this is looking at topics relating to physical accessibility, technical support, and awareness-raising within the organization.\n\nTraining and Education\n\nA disability power awareness session was offered to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, with the aim of encouraging openness and self-confidence when dealing with the issue of disability, especially in day-to-day work.\n\nThe launch of the working group and the abovementioned presentation laid the foundations for the topic in the 2023 reporting period. A road map is to be drawn up in 2024 and action areas resolved.\n\nUnited Internet has set itself the goal of signing a Group-wide inclusivity agreement in 2025 so as to create an inclusive working environment for people with disabilities.\n\n# Occupational Health and Safety, and Health Management\n\nEnsuring health and safety in the workplace is part of the Company's duty of care towards employees. United Internet's goal is to minimize accidents, sickness, and risks as far as possible and to promote employees' health. The focus is on two areas here: occupational health management (OHM), and occupational health and safety including data center safety. The policies and measures described in this section apply to all of the United Internet Group's German locations.\n\nAll issues relating to these two focus areas are discussed at the regular meetings of the Health and Safety Committee, both in relation to individual locations and at an overarching level.\n\n## Occupational Health Management (OHM)\n\nOccupational health management includes hazard assessments, occupational medical care, health promotion offerings, and preventive measures, among other things. This last category is broken down into focus topics at United Internet. These are exercise, ergonomics, nutrition, and mental health. The measures taken in these areas aim to create a health-promoting environment, develop skills, raise awareness, and influence concrete behavior. The offerings can differ slightly depending on the segment concerned.\n\nGRI 403-1 GRI 403-8 GRI 403-3\n\n## **Overview of OHM Measures on Focus Topics in 2023**\n\n- \"Exercise\" offerings: These include back health courses, outdoor circuit training, active breaks, and health-related campaigns such as \"Bike to Work.\" In addition, company runs were organized at the Company's major locations in Germany (including with the assistance of service providers B2Run and Berliner Teamstaffel). Discounts are offered for selected fitness studios. In addition, there are internal sports groups.\n- \"Ergonomics\" offerings: Since many employees mainly work sitting down, workplaces are regularly checked and adapted, and seated workstations are replaced by adjustable-height desks where necessary. When fitting out new buildings, care is taken to ensure that meeting areas in particular offer\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nspace for both sitting and standing. In addition, the Company's German locations(1) provide a range of ergonomics-related services such as advice on ergonomic seating options, specialist literature on the intranet, health care videos, and downloadable documents containing recommendations on how to work ergonomically and on compensating exercises.\n\n \"Nutrition\" offerings: The Company's own canteens offer healthy, sustainable meal options. United Internet bases its offering here on employee needs, with staff being able to provide feedback either directly or via dedicated surveys. For example, a vegan and a vegetarian dish is provided every day, as are salads, a wide variety of different bowls, energy bars that are made on the premises, and so on. Employee diversity and preferences are taken into account in the meat dishes. Since mid-2023 a milk alternative (an oat drink) has been offered at most locations in response to employee suggestions. Drinks and fruit are provided free of charge at all locations. The issue of staff meals is being addressed internally by a working group(2) and a food policy is being drawn up; this will be successively expanded as needed and will serve as guidelines or minimum requirements.\n\n \"Mental health\" offerings: Regular relaxation and well-being offerings such as yoga and resilience and mindfulness training are designed to promote resilience and reduce stress. In addition, management training on how to support staff under stress is provided in cooperation with UI Learning.(3) The Business Access Segment has independent offerings such as webinars and training courses in the area of mindfulness and mental health.\n\nThe OHM team, Vertrauenspersonen (designated persons of trust), and the specialist contact staff from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) also provide individual advice for staff and managers.\n\n## **Other OHM Measures in 2023**\n\n- Hazard assessments: Among other things, these comprised updating the documents on hazard assessment for maternity protection and protection against infection (with respect to COVID-19), organizing presentations on long COVID for managers and HR business partners, and first aid training.\n- Occupational medical care: This includes check-ups (e.g., for computer workstations), advisory services (e.g., relating to maternity protection), and offers of influenza vaccinations.\n- Health Week/Health Day: A virtual health week entitled \"Sustainably Healthy\" was held in 2023 in cooperation with German health insurance fund Techniker Krankenkasse.\n- Employee Assistance Program: United Internet helps all employees in Germany achieve a positive work-life balance even in challenging situations through its Employee Assistance Program, which is run in partnership with an external provider. Service provider contacts are available by phone around the clock to provide confidential advice on three core topics/offerings: parental counseling/childcare, care for relatives, and life coaching to cope with personal challenges. The Employee Assistance Program offers prevention and support services designed to promote mental and physical health. Among other things, these include resilience training, mindfulness and relaxation courses, and webinars on healthy eating. In addition, the external service provider supports employees experiencing difficult personal situations such as stress, illness, addiction, or financial crises by providing remote\n\nSee \"Focus Goal: Equal [Opportunities and Gender](#page-54-0)  Balance\" on page 55.\n\nGRI 403-4\n\nGRI 403-6\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> This applies to the Consumer Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments.\n\n<sup>(2)</sup> To date, this only applies to the Consumer Access, Business Access, and Business Applications segments.

Intranet posts are used to inform staff regularly of the service and of other health-related measures.\n\n- Communication on the topic: The intranet and onboarding events for employees and managers are used to inform them of health promotion measures and offerings, and a health mailbox and intranet discussion channels are provided that they can use to submit suggestions, ideas, or their own initiatives (for example, a lunchtime \"wild plant walk\" was organized on the back of an employee initiative).\n- Health strategy: Occupational health management activities and internal communications on this topic are being continuously enhanced and expanded at a strategic level. As part of this, a Health & Care requirements survey(1) was performed in order to understand employees' needs and expectations, to derive new, focused measures from these, and to further optimize current offerings. In addition, health promotion offerings are regularly evaluated and feedback obtained from employees so as to enhance the formats used. In 2022, work started on implementing hybrid health promotion formats that combine face-to-face and online offerings, leveraging the benefits of both formats for employees and also improving the coverage offered to smaller locations.(2)\n- Supplementary health insurance: Since October 2023, the Business Access Segment has offered employees employer-financed supplementary health insurance as a contribution to preventing and treating sickness. Employees are provided with an annual health budget that can be used individually to source offerings from a service catalog. A broad portfolio of advisory and health care services is provided (e.g., check-ups, dental treatment, and natural remedies).\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety, Including Data Center Safety\n\nAnnual safety inspections in line with health and safety agency/statutory rules and regulations are performed at the Company's German locations together with experts from external service providers.(3) In addition, reports are evaluated and implemented, and Health and Safety Committee meetings are held, at these locations. Health and safety activities are continuously enhanced on the basis of the statutory/health and safety agency rules and regulations.\n\nOnly authorized employees have permanent access to the data centers.(4) These employees are obliged to attend (digital) training, including on the following subjects:\n\n- How to behave if there is a fire\n- How to behave in an emergency\n- First aid courses run by the DGUV (Germany's statutory accident insurance scheme) that are specially tailored to data center environments\n- Emergency first aid training in the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)\n- Fire prevention training that is specially tailored to data center environments\n\n(3) Business Access: Annual safety inspections in administrative locations with more than 20 staff; smaller locations are inspected every three years.\n\n(4) This relates to the data centers in the Business Applications Segment.\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> The survey was performed in the Consumer Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments.\n\n<sup>(2)</sup> The offerings apply to the Consumer Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Safety training for electrical equipment\n- Practical training in Category III personal protective equipment (PPE)\n\nIn addition, courses and training are organized for those employees who are responsible for powering up and booting servers in the abovementioned data centers. The Company works together with Verwaltungs-Berufsgenossenschaft (VBG), the German occupational health and safety agency, to train safety officers for each operations team, who then attend regular courses.\n\nIn addition, United Internet is assisted by external occupational safety and fire protection specialists. An internal communications platform is used to provide employees with emergency manuals, work instructions, and the rules and regulations to be followed.\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety in Figures\n\n The objective of the measures described above is to reduce stress-related absences and avoid accidents at work. Work on pinpointing the causes of absences and accidents will continue in future so as to identify any other measures that may be necessary. The following table gives a breakdown of absences due to employee illness in Germany. United Internet is below the national average for its sector.(1)\n\n| Absentee rate(1)              | 2021 | ✓ 2022 | ✓ 2023 |\n|-------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Absence due to illness (in %) | 4.3  | 5.0    | 4.9    |\n| Number of accident reports(2) | 36   | 21     | 35     |\n| on the way to and from work   | 4    | 5      | 6      |\n\n(1) The figures relate to all core employees in Germany.\n\n(2) The number of accident reports in 2023 relates to reportable workplace accidents (absence > 3 days). In previous years, accidents involving absences of ≤ 3 days were also included. Consequently, comparability is limited. The change was made proactively in preparation for the future requirements of the CSRD/ESRSs.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nI TAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nTraining and Education\n\n#### <span id=\"page-60-0\"></span> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n Working Conditions and Human Resources Strategy\n\nDiversity and Equal Opportunities Occupational Health and Safety, and Health Management\n\n Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent **Social Commitment** \n\nSocial Commitment\n\nSocial Commitment\n\nAs an internet provider, United Internet operates in a dynamic and highly competitive market. However, its economic activities aren't the whole story: United Internet is also part of society and can only be successful if this functions properly, too. This explains why the United Internet Group is committed to helping ensure a stable society that can meet future challenges.\n\nUnited Internet aims not to lose sight of how its business activities impact people and the environment, and to help ensure a stable and forward-looking society. Its goal is to contribute to people's prosperity both within and outside the corporate environment. The United Internet Group does this by creating jobs and traineeships, through its products, and through its social commitment. United Internet's activities in this last area include the following:\n\n### United Internet for UNICEF\n\nIn 2006, foundation donor and United Internet AG CEO Ralph Dommermuth, together with Tessa Page, laid the groundwork for a consistently successful initiative that has helped children throughout the world for many years. Through the United Internet for UNICEF foundation, the Company supports projects run by UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) worldwide. By working together with this globally recognized and qualified partner it aims to help improve equal opportunities for, and the wellbeing of, children around the world.\n\nRalph Dommermuth was honored by UNICEF Germany for his many years of work in the 2023 reporting period. He was awarded the special \"Children's Rights\" prize that UNICEF awards for outstanding longterm work in this area in June. Georg Graf Waldersee, Chairman of the UNICEF Committee for Germany, presented him with the prize in Montabaur.\n\n### Supporting Inclusion\n\nUnited Internet supports the inclusion of, and employment opportunities for, people with physical or mental disabilities. One of the ways it does this is by passing on waste equipment to AfB gGmbH. According to the information provided by this recycling specialist, 42% of its workforce are people with disabilities. Another way in which United Internet promotes working together with people with physical and mental disabilities is through its partnership with disabled people's cooperative GDW (Genossenschaft der Werkstätten für behinderte Menschen Mitte eG), which has shredded and recycled the Company's old files and records for many years now.\n\n## United Internet for UNICEF: A Sustained Focus on Helping Children in Need\n\n United Internet's close cooperation with the United Internet for UNICEF foundation has been a core element of its social commitment since 2006.\n\nAmong other things, UNICEF supports projects promoting education, health, and child protection with the goal of improving children's living conditions. In addition, it provides humanitarian aid to mitigate natural disasters and their consequences.\n\nWe are part of society and are committed to helping ensure its stability and ability to meet future challenges.\n\n📄\n\n[See also \"Environmental](#page-62-0)  Responsibility\" on page 63ff.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n The foundation helps raise donations and acquire sustaining sponsors by running appeals for donations on the United Internet Group's online platforms and in the form of mailings. The high levels of traffic on the Company's GMX, WEB.DE, and 1&1 portals increase the reach and awareness of these appeals. This broad reach makes United Internet one of UNICEF's largest German corporate partners.\n\nUnited Internet employs a permanent staff member to coordinate the foundation's activities with the assistance of volunteer colleagues. The Management Board is informed of these activities at least once a month. The colleagues work closely together with the foundation's chair, Tessa Page, with the other members of the foundation board, and with UNICEF.\n\nThe foundation's performance is monitored in the regular reports from the foundation board. One-time and repeat donations are passed on in full to UNICEF because all foundation staff are either volunteers or are not paid from donations.\n\nUnited Internet also pledges additional financial support for selected donation appeals designed to attract sustaining sponsors: The \"Double It\" campaigns match donations by private individuals up to a set overall limit. Thanks to this incentive, among other things, the foundation was able to recruit 472 new sustaining sponsors for UNICEF as a result of its 2023 Christmas mailing alone (2022: 546). The major Christmas campaigns in the reporting period were devoted to child labor in Bangladesh and winter assistance for children in Ukraine.\n\nThe foundation's appeals in the 2023 reporting period led to further donations to UNICEF of €4.6 million (2022: €5.4 million). This brings the total volume of donations raised since the foundation was set up in 2006 to over €69 million.\n\nThe appeals for donations in 2023 largely revolved around three devastating natural disasters and two wars, which posed immense challenges for humanitarian work. This being the case, topics such as the impact of climate change in Madagascar and child labor in the (cobalt) mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo initially took a back seat.\n\nIn February, the foundation sent out its first emergency mailing to raise money for the children affected by the major earthquake in Syria and Turkey. The donations in excess of €500,000 benefited humanitarian work in Syria, since Turkey had not yet asked for assistance at the time of dispatch.\n\nLibya was hit by unbelievable volumes of water in September. Three times the amount of rain that led to the catastrophic flooding in Germany's Ahrtal caused a number of dams to break and washed large parts of the port of Darna out to sea. More than 10,000 people died and thousands are still missing. United Internet for UNICEF supported UNICEF's work with roughly €190,000.\n\nAfghanistan was also hit by another series of major earthquakes that claimed the lives of thousands of people in the west of the country in October. The region concerned is geographically remote, which made aid and rescue measures more difficult. Since this mailing only went to foundation subscribers, only slightly more than €17,000 was raised. Prior to this, the foundation's Easter campaign had already collected roughly €60,000 for children in Afghanistan.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nJ TAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>E N V I RO N M E N TA L\n\n63\n\nRESPONSIBILITY **Energy Consumption and Decarbonization**  Material Efficiency and Circularity\n\n# ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n The \"Environmental Responsibility\" chapter covers two material topics: decarbonization and material efficiency and circularity.\n\nUnited Internet is aware of the impact that its business model has on the climate. It aims to conserve energy and resources, to improve continuously, and to help protect the environment and the climate in everything from green logistics through to the highly efficient operations of its own data centers. Decarbonization is United Internet's largest lever when it comes to helping protect the climate despite the energy consumed by its telecommunications services. The Company is focusing on decarbonizing its network infrastructure and data centers so as to meet its environmental responsibility. United Internet works\n\nUnited Internet aims to contribute to climate protection by using resources efficiently.\n\nceaselessly to design its processes and products to be environmentally friendly and to conserve resources. It uses materials efficiently and makes a contribution to the circular economy by promoting the circularity of the IT hardware that it uses itself and of its customers' end-users devices.\n\n## Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/13 description: The image shows two icons related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first icon, in the top half of the image, is for Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. It features the number \"12\" in the upper left corner, followed by the text \"RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION\" in a sans-serif font. Below the text is a white infinity symbol with an arrow pointing to the left, all set against a golden-brown background. The second icon, in the bottom half of the image, is for Goal 13: Climate Action. It features the number \"13\" in the upper left corner, followed by the text \"CLIMATE ACTION\" in a sans-serif font, all set against a green background.\n\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns.\n\n13 CLIMATE\nACTION\n\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Energy Consumption and Decarbonization\n\n<span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>Material topic: Decarbonization\n\nGRI 302-1 GRI 302-2 GRI 302-3 GRI 302-4 GRI 305-1 GRI 305-2 GRI 305-3\n\n## **A**\n\nScope 1: Direct emissions generated by the company's own production facilities and vehicles.\n\nScope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased energy (primarily electricity and heating).\n\nScope 3: All other emissions caused by the Company's activities but not under its control (e.g., at suppliers, service providers, and customers).\n\n Internet and telecommunications services such as those provided by United Internet inevitably entail substantial use of energy. Consequently, decarbonization is an important topic for United Internet and its stakeholders.\n\nUnited Internet's offering revolves around the use of both its own and third-party data centers and the operation of the Group's own fiber-optic network; taken together, these account for by far the largest proportion (> 80%) of the Group's total energy consumption. In line with this, United Internet's activities to date to save energy, increase efficiency, and reduce emissions have focused on these two areas. Information on the management approach used in the Business Applications Segment (data centers) is provided in the relevant subsection. Additional management policies for the fiber-optic network will also be developed going forward as part of a more detailed examination of the topic of decarbonization.\n\nIn addition, the United Internet Group's business relationships impact the environment. This applies in particular to its use of its business partners' fiber-optic networks and the energy consumption associated with this, which is also disclosed in this report. The electricity used to power third-party mobile networks (such as national roaming) is not included. Other emissions in the upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3) have only been quantified in fragmentary form to date (e.g., emissions from business travel, purchased goods and services, and shipments to customers). United Internet intends to determine and disclose its carbon footprint for all material categories in future reports in line with the CSRD, and to develop a policy for decarbonizing its own value chain.\n\nThe decisive levers for decarbonizing United Internet's economic activities are improving energy efficiency (especially in the Group's own data centers and in the fiber-optic network) and reducing – and ideally completely avoiding – carbon emissions by deploying renewable energy.\n\nAll United Internet segments are accelerating the use of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (\"green electricity\") on the basis of Group-wide rules and recommendations. The migration has now largely been completed for the Group's own data centers, its offices in Germany and Austria, and the infrastructure for which it has its own direct supply contracts. Regular operations at the data centers owned by IONOS and 1&1 are emissions-free, since they source green electricity. The impact of the Group's fiber-optic network operations is also being reduced by using green electricity. Conventional electricity is only sourced in the case of shared technical facilities and infrastructure that belong to business partners (e.g., leased data centers) and some international office locations.\n\nEven though comprehensive, overarching decarbonization targets had not yet been defined in the reporting period, work on individual measures continued and is continuing successfully.\n\nAs in the past, more than half of total energy consumption in 2023 was attributable to the Company's worldwide data center operations, while slightly less than one-third or so was caused by its fiber-optic network operations. Electricity and heating consumption by United Internet's office and logistics buildings, and fuel consumption by company cars, data centers, and technical locations contribute substantially less to total energy consumption. Details on the information given in the following tabular overview can be found in the following sections.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n Other KPIs that will throw light on software efficiency, user numbers, and enhancements to product features are being prepared.\n\nThe software on which GMX, WEB.DE, and mail.com brand products are based builds on a powerful server infrastructure in the IONOS data centers. In recent years, a private cloud infrastructure was developed that takes the form of 16 Kubernetes clusters in three data centers. This allows different applications to be run together on a central platform without having to provide dedicated technical resources designed to cope with maximum loads for each application. The construction and continuous expansion of the infrastructure is based on strategic decisions. The Management Board is regularly informed of the progress made. Migrating United Internet's software assets to this platform reduced the number of servers and virtual machines despite the increase in requirements mentioned above. Today, more than 50% of the software solutions are already running in the cloud. Measures are being derived on the basis of the KPI defined above (energy consumption per CPU hour) to further optimize capacity utilization and energy efficiency going forward.\n\n## Energy Consumption by the Fiber-optic and Mobile Network\n\n A high priority is also given to reducing electricity consumption and associated environmental impacts during fiber-optic network operations. The most important measure being taken here is to use green electricity at the Company's own technical locations. 1&1 Versatel does not itself manage electricity procurement for those fiber-optic networks that it sources from third parties (city carriers, Deutsche Telekom, etc.). In these cases electricity consumption is paid for via usage fees. For those locations in which 1&1 Versatel cannot influence electricity sourcing, it is planning to fully offset emissions using validated certificates in the year following receipt and review of the current consumption invoices; this will be done for the first time for the 2023 reporting period. This means that offsetting for the 2023 reporting period will be performed after the sustainability report has been published.\n\nAir conditioning technology was optimized at a number of German locations in the 2023 reporting period as part of work on expanding the 5G network by installing direct and indirect free cooling systems. This kind of system uses cool outside air for air conditioning, hence cutting energy consumption.\n\nA clear increase in electricity consumption was recorded in the 2023 reporting period, due in particular to the steady expansion of the fiber-optic network. This is largely due to the systematic push to connect industrial estates, the construction of networks for (large) customers, partnerships with other network operators, and the acquisition of existing infrastructure.\n\nAs in previous years, the electricity consumption figures disclosed here show electricity consumption at 1&1 Versatel's own locations and at those locations where 1&1 Versatel is a user. For the first time the figures also include consumption by the Consumer Access Segment's mast locations that were constructed in the reporting period.\n\nIn addition to the consumption of electricity, 1&1 Versatel's technical locations produce residual emissions from standby power systems (emergency power) during normal operations (emergency operations and testing). The continuous expansion of 1&1 Versatel's network means that the number of technical locations is also increasing. The plan is for the central energy service provider to supply the company's own locations with certified green energy. However, in rare exceptions power cannot be supplied via the local network provider in time. In these cases, standby power systems are being used temporarily as a stop-gap measure until regular operations can start as quick as possible and the intended energy service provider can start supplying energy, so as to avoid endangering the rollout schedule. The volume and duration of the standby operations required in these cases will be successively reduced as the network expansion process is optimized.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n| COMPANY PROFILE                                                    | EU TAXONOMY | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY | DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY | SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY | ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY              |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--|\n|                                                                    |             |                          |                        |                       | Energy Consumption and<br>Decarbonization |  |\n|                                                                    |             |                          |                        |                       | Material Efficiency and<br>Circularity    |  |\n| Electricity consumption – fiber-optic<br>and mobile network in MWh |             |                          | 2021                   | ✓ 2022                | ✓ 2023                                    |  |\n| Electricity consumption – technical locations(1)                   |             |                          | 56,589                 | 66,408                | 86,490                                    |  |\n| thereof green electricity                                          |             |                          | 21,148                 | 57,056                | 79,073                                    |  |\n| Fuel consumption – technical locations                             |             |                          | n/a                    | n/a                   | 335                                       |  |\n\n(1) The figures cover electricity consumption for all 1&1 Versatel's own technical locations, plus locations where 1&1 Versatel is a user. Consumption was estimated for a few individual locations for which no readings are currently available. The itemized consumption data shown in previous years was reported in total for the reporting period. Consumption for the 2023 reporting period also includes consumption for the 1&1 mobile network. Electricity consumed to power third-party mobile networks (such as national roaming) is not included.\n\n## Energy Consumption by Office and Logistics Buildings\n\n United Internet's office and logistics buildings account for a comparatively small share of the Group's total energy consumption. These buildings need energy in the form of electricity and heating.\n\nEfforts in the reporting period and in previous years focused on saving energy and reducing emissions in the data centers and the fiber-optic network. An end-to-end management approach for energy consumption in office and logistics buildings had not yet been put in place during the reporting period. The newly captured figures will serve as the basis for expanding policies and setting targets in this area.\n\n## **Electricity Consumption at Office and Logistics Locations**\n\n The electricity sourced for a large part of the Group was switched to certified green electricity in recent years, reducing carbon emissions and the resulting climate impact. This migration process has now largely been completed, with a total of 39 – including all major – office and logistics locations in Germany and Austria now using certified green electricity.\n\nElectricity consumption at office locations in Germany declined slightly year over year. Further analysis is needed to determine whether this decrease is attributable to energy saving measures in 2023.\n\nOnly incomplete information is available for the foreign office locations (roughly 18% of the Group's total workforce); this applies both to consumption figures and to the use of renewable energy. Consumption for the international locations was therefore extrapolated so as to be able to disclose a total figure for electricity consumption throughout the Group.\n\n| Electricity consumption – office and<br>logistics buildings in MWh(1) | 2021   |  2022(2) |  2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Electricity consumption – German locations                            | 12,409 | 11,463    | 10,359 |\n| Electricity consumption – international locations                     | n/a    | 2,028     | 2,430  |\n| Total electricity consumption                                         | 12,409 | 13,491    | 12,789 |\n\n(1) The figures relate to United Internet's offices and related technical infrastructure. The figures for the international locations are based on estimates using the location size (area, number of employees).\n\n(2) Figures adjusted due to better data availability.\n\n## **Heating Consumption at Office and Logistics Locations**\n\n An overall estimate of heating consumption has been published for the current reporting period. Inconsistent and staggered meter reading and billing periods and the fact that, for many locations, heating consumption can only be determined using landlords' service charge invoices make it more difficult in many locations – and in some cases impossible – to capture exact data.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring extrapolation of the heat consumption data for the current reporting period, inconsistencies in the way the prior-year estimates were calculated were discovered; these led to a significant discrepancy in the consumption data. As a result, the prior-year figures were corrected retrospectively using an optimized estimation methodology.\n\nThe figures given now offer a plausible estimate of United Internet's total heating consumption, which – given the fact that heat generation is based on fossil fuels – make a significant contribution to the Group's emissions.\n\n| Heating consumption – office and<br>logistics buildings in MWh(1) | 2021  |  2022(2) |  2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| Measured heating consumption                                      | 3,426 | 9,820     | 6,671  |\n| thereof natural gas                                               | 3,426 | 3,818     | 2,315  |\n| thereof district heating                                          | n/a   | 5,760     | 4,188  |\n| thereof heating oil                                               | n/a   | 242       | 169    |\n| Estimated heating consumption for remaining locations             | n/a   | 3,355     | 9,371  |\n| thereof natural gas                                               | n/a   | 1,391     | 4,321  |\n| thereof district heating                                          | n/a   | 1,964     | 5,050  |\n| thereof heating oil                                               | n/a   | 0         | 0      |\n| Total heating consumption                                         | 3,426 | 13,176    | 16,042 |\n\n(1) The figures for measured gas, district heating, and heating oil consumption relate to German and Austrian locations that account for roughly 40% of the Group's office space. The actual figures for the prior year were used, since in many locations heating consumption can only be determined using landlords' service charge invoices, which had not been submitted for the reporting period by the editorial deadline. Heating consumption was estimated for all locations for which no consumption data was available.\n\n(2) Figures adjusted due to better data availability.\n\n## Energy Consumption by Company Cars\n\n United Internet works together with external partners when using rental and company cars. These partners provide it with regular information on vehicle fleet usage and evaluate fuel cards, enabling United Internet to monitor trends in fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n| Company cars                                                    | 2021    |  2022  |  2023    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|\n| Fuel consumption (gasoline and diesel) in liters                | 834,306 | 953,058 | 1,234,945 |\n| Fuel consumption per company vehicle in liters(1)               | 1,107   | 1,217   | 1,575     |\n| Electricity consumption in MWh(2)                               | -       | -       | 192       |\n| Electricity consumption per company e-vehicle in<br>MWh/vehicle | -       | -       | 3.2       |\n\n(1) The number of vehicles reported as assets as of December 31 of the reporting period in question (2023: 844; 2022: 783; 2021: 754); the number of vehicles in the fleet may vary over the course of the year.\n\n(2) Consumption figures for e-vehicles in the reporting period were projected on the basis of the net costs and an average price per KWh, due to insufficient data being available.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nTAXONOMY\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nE N V I RO N M E N TA L\n\nRESPONSIBILITY **Energy Consumption and Decarbonization**  Material Efficiency and Circularity\n\n## Own Direct and Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n The energy consumption data above permit an assessment of the United Internet Group's direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) own greenhouse gas emissions to be made for the first time.\n\nAlthough electricity consumption accounts for roughly 85–90% of United Internet's total energy consumption, electricity-related emissions only account for roughly one-third of total emissions.\n\n| Carbon emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalents (1)                                      | 2021   | ✓ 2022(2) | ✓ 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|\n| CO2 equivalents from heating energy consumption<br>(gas and oil)                       | 452    | 1,108     | 1,390  |\n| CO2 equivalents from fuel consumption in data centers                                  | 208    | 267       | 257    |\n| CO2 equivalents from fuel consumption in technical locations                           | -      | -         | 87     |\n| CO2 equivalents from fuel consumption for company cars (3)                             | 3,074  | 3,025     | 3,204  |\n| Total direct carbon emissions (Scope 1)                                                | 3,734  | 4,400     | 4,938  |\n| CO2 equivalents from electricity consumption in data<br>centers(4)                     | n/a    | 13,857    | 0      |\n| CO2 equivalents from electricity consumption in the fiber-<br>optic and mobile network | 14,885 | 5,777     | 3      |\n| CO2 equivalents from electricity consumption in offices and<br>logistics buildings     | 1,549  | 1,572     | 1,718  |\n| CO2 equivalents from electricity consumption – company cars                            | -      | -         | 131    |\n| CO2 equivalents from district heating for offices and logistics<br>buildings           | n/a    | 2,163     | 2,587  |\n| Total indirect own carbon emissions (Scope 2)                                          | 16,434 | 23,369    | 4,440  |\n| Total own carbon emissions (Scope 1+2)                                                 | 20,168 | 27,769    | 9,378  |\n\n(1) Energy and fuel consumption figures were converted into carbon emissions using official conversion factors provided by e.g., the Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control), the European Energy Agency, and the Association of Issuing Bodies.\n\n(2) Figures adjusted due to better data availability.\n\n(3) The emissions from fuel consumption for company cars include extrapolations.\n\n(4) In contrast to the previous year, emissions from leased data centers were assigned to Scope 3 instead of Scope 2 in the reporting period. These are estimated to be approximately 18,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents for 2023.\n\n(5) In contrast to the previous year, emissions from leased data centers were assigned to Scope 3 instead of Scope 2 in the reporting period. These are estimated to be approximately 18,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents for 2023.\n\n A large proportion of the electricity consumed does not produce any carbon emissions since green electricity is used (market-based method). Calculating the emissions theoretically on the basis of the regional electricity mix (location-based method) produces a figure of 68,542 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. In other words, using electricity from renewable energy sources allows United Internet to significantly reduce the Group's total emissions.\n\n## Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Value Chain\n\nWhereas more or less complete estimates of United Internet's direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) own greenhouse gas emissions can be produced, it has not been possible so far to adequately analyze and quantify a large majority of the indirect emissions in its value chain (Scope 3). Existing data and comparisons with other companies suggest with a high degree of probability that Scope 3 emissions significantly exceed Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. United Internet is attempting to successively determine reliable information and estimates about all 15 Scope 3 categories (as set out in the GHG Protocol).\n\nThe following sections contain fragmentary information about two Scope 3 areas for which data and estimates have been available for some time.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/20 description: The image shows a gray icon of a document with the letter \"A\" in a circle on top of it. The document is a rectangle with rounded corners.\n\nGHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol): An international greenhouse gas emissions accounting standard.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Employee Mobility**\n\nThe Group is distributed across roughly 40 locations in nine countries, a fact that makes high demands on employee mobility. Employee travel generates carbon emissions.\n\nUnited Internet aims to reduce travel-related emissions, both by avoiding business trips and by using climate-neutral options such as rail travel. The Commercial Services department works closely together with HR to manage employee mobility. Responsibility for this topic ranges from business trip management through vehicle fleet monitoring down to defining the terms on which company cars are provided and can be used.\n\nUnited Internet has taken the following measures to promote environmentally friendly mobility:\n\n### Avoiding business trips\n\nEquipping meeting rooms with conference call and videoconferencing technology means that many business trips can be avoided. In addition, instant messaging services improve internal communications and can help reduce trips between locations even further.\n\n#### Climate-friendly travel\n\nThe approvals process is designed to encourage employees to use the train as their preferred means of transportation. This allows climate-neutral travel for long-distance trips. What is more, employees can use the car pool service on the Company's intranet to arrange to travel together. Local rules that are similar to the general Group rules exist in some segments.\n\n#### Vehicle fleet\n\nUnited Internet's company car rules limit the impact the vehicle fleet has on the environment, e.g., by restricting the available engine options. In addition, the Group works continuously to ensure its fleet represents the state of the art at all times from both an environmental and an economic perspective. United Internet also examines the use of alternative technologies, with the goal in all cases being to take economically and environmentally acceptable decisions. Vehicle fleet management is largely performed by United Internet Corporate Services. Additional local rules now only exist in a few cases.\n\n### Leasing of company bicycles\n\nThe United Internet Group has offered a company bicycle leasing scheme since June 2020. Employees can use the scheme to lease bicycles at a subsidized monthly rate and can actively contribute to protecting the environment and to improving the traffic situation by cycling to work, among other things. Employees have reacted positively to the offering.\n\n### Paperless travel expense claims\n\nStating in 2019, the United Internet Group introduced a workflow for submitting paperless travel expense claims that also offers improved transparency as to alternative means of transportation and travel expenses.\n\nGRI 302-1 GRI 302-2 GRI 305-1 GRI 305-2 GRI 305-3 \n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Reporting Period, Reporting Cycle, and Scope of Application\n\nUnited Internet's sustainability report is published annually. This report covers the fiscal year from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, like the financial reporting. Where appropriate, prior-period figures for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 are presented or outlooks are given, as required under the GRI Standards. Such places are specifically indicated.\n\nSince this is the sustainability report for the United Internet Group, the statements it contains apply in principle to all divisions and locations, and to all subsidiaries in which United Internet holds a majority interest. Where individual disclosures do not yet apply to all companies, locations, and areas covered by this report, this is indicated. The goal is to continuously expand the data pool on which the reporting is based. The previous report was published in April 2023.\n\n## Preparation, Publication, and Examination of the Sustainability Report\n\nThe consolidated nonfinancial report in the form of this sustainability report is prepared and published by United Internet AG's Chief Financial Officer on behalf of the Company's Management Board. Information required by the CSR-RUG underwent a limited assurance review in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised). In the course of its subsequent independent examination, the Supervisory Board addressed the nonfinancial report as a whole in depth and examined it to establish whether it complies with the law, and is due and proper and appropriate. The Supervisory Board critically evaluated the contents of the consolidated nonfinancial report and discussed them with the Management Board, which was available to answer supplementary questions and provide additional information. Following its own examination, the Supervisory Board came to the conclusion that there were no grounds for any objections to the consolidated nonfinancial report.\n\nThis report will be made publicly available in German and English as a PDF download on United Internet AG's website as from early April 2024.\n\nGRI 2-5\n\nGRI 2-2 GRI 2-3\n\nSee Reports on the [United Internet website.](https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html) \n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>Key Figures According to EU Taxonomy\n\n#### Key Figures According to EU Taxonomy – Turnover 2023\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                                                                  |          | Year         | Substantial Contribution Criteria  |                               |                               |            |               |                      | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') |                                |                                |            |                |                       |                   |                         |                                                                                   |                                 |                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Economic Activities (1)                                                                                              | Code (2) | Turnover (3) | Proportion of Turnover, year N (4) | Climate Change Mitigation (5) | Climate Change Adaptation (6) | Water (7)  | Pollution (8) | Circular Economy (9) | Biodiversity (10)                             | Climate Change Mitigation (11) | Climate Change Adaptation (12) | Water (13) | Pollution (14) | Circular Economy (15) | Biodiversity (16) | Minimum Safeguards (17) | Proportion of Taxonomy aligned (A.1.) or eligible (A.2.) turnover, year 2022 (18) | Category enabling activity (19) | Category transition activity (20) |\n|                                                                                                                      |          | € million    | %                                  | Y; N; N/EL                    | Y; N; N/EL                    | Y; N; N/EL | Y; N; N/EL    | Y; N; N/EL           | Y; N; N/EL                                    | Y/N                            | Y/N                            | Y/N        | Y/N            | Y/N                   | Y/N               | Y/N                     | %                                                                                 | E                               | T                                 |\n| A.

id=\"page-89-0\"></span>Independent Practitioner's Report\n\n## Independent Practitioner's Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Non-financial Reporting\n\nTo United Internet AG, Montabaur\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the separate non-financial group report of United Internet AG, Montabaur, (hereinafter the \"Company\") for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 which in total comprises the disclosures denoted with a \"\" in the sustainability report of the Company for the financial year 2023 (hereinafter the \"Separate Non-financial Group Report\").\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Separate Non-financial Group Report.\n\n## **Responsibility of the Executive Directors**\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Separate Non-financial Group Report in accordance with §§ (Articles) 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": \"German Commercial Code\") and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted there-under, as well as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in section \"EU-Taxonomy\" of the Separate Non-financial Group Report.\n\nThis responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a Separate Non-financial Group Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section \"EU-Taxonomy\" of the Separate Non-financial Group Report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Audit Firm's Independence and Quality Management**\n\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (\"Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer\": \"BS WP/vBP\") as well as the Standard on Quality Management 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality management for audit firms (IDW Qualitätsmanagementstandard 1: Anforderungen an das Qualitätsmanagement in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)), which requires the audit firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management that complies with the applicable legal requirements and professional standards.\n\n## **Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the Separate Non-financial Group Report based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's Separate Non-financial Group Report, other than the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Separate Non-financial Group Report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Dele-gated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section \"EU-Taxonomy\" of the Separate Non-financial Group Report.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reason-able assurance engagement, and accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgement of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gain an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved in the preparation of the Separate Non-financial Group Report about the preparation process, about the internal control system relating to this process and about disclosures in the Separate Non-financial Group Re-port\n- Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the Separate Non-financial Group Report\n- Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Separate Non-financial Group Report\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and group management report\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Evaluation of CO2 compensation certificates exclusively with regard to their existence, but not with regard to their impact\n- Evaluation of the presentation of the Separate Non-financial Group Report\n- Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Separate Non-financial Group Report\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n## **Assurance Opinion**\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Separate Non-financial Group Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section \"EU-Taxonomy\" of the Separate Non-financial Group Report. We do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Separate Non-financial Group Report.\n\n## **Restriction of Use**\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the Company. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.\n\nDüsseldorf, 19 March 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nMatthias Mühlenfeld ppa.

Moreover, certain information may not be verifiable by the auditor: such \"non-auditable information\" cannot be assessed by the auditor due to the nature of the disclosures or the absence of suitable criteria.\n\nIn the Combined Management Report of United Internet AG for the Company and the Group as of December 31, 2023, the following chapters or disclosures were identified as \"non-audited management report disclosures\":\n\n- The disclosures made in the subsection \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" are \"nonaudited management report disclosures\", as the content of \"non-management report-related disclosures\" is not audited.\n- The \"quarterly development\" tables contained in the subsections \"2.2 Business development\" and \"2.3 Position of the Group\" with key financial figures on a quarterly basis for the segments and the Group are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as United Internet does not subject its Interim Financial Statements to a review or audit. The quarterly figures are marked accordingly as \"unaudited\".\n- The German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") recommends disclosures on the internal control and risk management system. These go beyond the statutory requirements for the management report and are not included in the auditor's review of the content of the management report (\"non-management report-related disclosures\"). In chapter 5 \"Internal control and risk management system\", they are thematically assigned to the main elements of the internal control and risk management system and are separated from the disclosures to be audited by separate paragraphs and marked accordingly as \"unaudited\".\n- The disclosures made in chapter \"7. Declaration on Company Management\" are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as an audit of the disclosures contained in the Declaration on Company Management in accordance with section 317 (2) sentence 6 German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB) is limited to the fact that the information has been provided and the Corporate Governance Report in chapter 7 constitutes a \"non-management report-related disclosure\" which is not subject to a substantive audit.\n\n# General notes\n\n- Due to calculation processes, tables and references may produce rounding differences from the mathematically exact values (monetary units, percentage statements, etc.).\n- For reasons of better readability, the additional use of the female form is omitted in this report. United Internet would like to stress that the use of the masculine form is to be understood purely as the gender-neutral form.\n- These Annual Financial Statements are available in German and English. Both versions can also be downloaded at www.united-internet.de. In all cases of doubt, the German version shall prevail.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.

In the case of business with ADSL connections (currently being phased out), further advance service providers are used.\n\nUnited Internet is also one of the leading providers of mobile internet products in Germany.\n\nSince the launch of mobile services on December 8, 2023, 1&1's mobile communications network has been fully operational. Wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient mobile coverage during its years of network expansion, it uses national roaming. This is currently provided by Telefónica and as of summer 2024 national roaming services are to be procured from Vodafone. National roaming is a standard procedure used in the rollout of new mobile networks that enables customers to surf and make calls without interruption in areas not yet covered. This is achieved by automatically using the roaming partner's antennas in these areas.\n\nUntil 1&1 has migrated its more than 12 million existing customers to its own 1&1 mobile network, it will also use the Telefónica mobile network as a so-called Mobile Bitstream Access Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MBA MVNO), as well as MVNO capacities of Vodafone. As of the beginning of 2024, existing MVNO customers are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network.\n\nMobile internet products are marketed via the premium brand 1&1 as well as via discount brands, such as winSIM and sim.de.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Access segment**\n\nIn its Business Access segment, United Internet offers a wide range of telecommunication products and services for business customers via 1&1 Versatel.\n\nThe core of this business model is the operation of a modern fiber-optic network with a length of over 61,000 km, which is one of the largest networks in Germany and is constantly being expanded.\n\n1&1 Versatel uses this network to offer telecommunication products – from standardized fiber-optic direct connections to tailored ICT solutions (voice, data and network solutions) – to companies and local authorities. In addition, the 1&1 fiber-optic network is offered for infrastructure services (wholesale) to national and international carriers.\n\n## **Consumer Applications segment**\n\nApplications for home users are pooled in the Consumer Applications segment. In particular, these applications include Personal Information Management applications (e-mail, to-do lists, appointments, addresses), and online storage (cloud), as well as domains, website solutions tailored to consumer needs, and office software.\n\nIn the course of portfolio development over the past few years, the GMX and WEB.DE brands have been expanded from pure e-mail service providers to complete command centers for the communication, information, and identity management needs of users.\n\nApplications for home users are nearly all developed in-house and operated at the Group's own data centers. Products are offered as fee-based subscriptions (pay accounts) or - for free - in the form of ad-financed accounts (free accounts). Online advertising is marketed by United Internet Media.\n\nWith its GMX and WEB.DE brands, United Internet operates primarily in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where it is among the leading players.\n\nSince the acquisition of the US provider mail.com, United Internet has also been driving its international expansion in this segment. In addition to the USA, mail.com targets other countries, such as the UK, France, and Spain.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the Business Applications segment, United Internet opens up online business opportunities for freelancers and SMEs, helping them digitize their processes. This involves offering a broad range of products, such as domains, websites, web hosting, servers and e-shops, group work, online storage (cloud), and office software, which customers use via subscription agreements. In addition, cloud solutions and cloud infrastructure are offered.\n\nThe applications are developed at in-house development centers or in cooperation with partner firms and operated on over 100,000 servers at 11 own data centers and 21 co-locations.\n\nIn its Business Applications segment, United Internet is also a leading global player with activities in Europe (Germany, France, the UK, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Sweden) as well as in North America (the USA, Canada, Mexico).\n\nBusiness applications are marketed to specific target groups via differently positioned brands, such as IONOS, Strato, Fasthosts, Arsys, home.pl, InterNetX, united-domains, and World4You. In its after-market business, United Internet also offers customers professional services in the field of active domain management. Moreover, other hosting suppliers are offered a white-label website builder for the creation of high-quality websites via the we22 brand.\n\nImage /page/7/Figure/5 description: The image shows a table with two main categories: \"Access\" and \"Applications\", each divided into \"Consumer\" and \"Business\" subcategories. Under \"Access\", the \"Consumer\" subcategory lists brands such as smartmobil.de, yourfone, 1&1, simplytel DeutschlandSIM, winSIM Premium SIM, and maxXxım. The \"Business\" subcategory under \"Access\" includes 1&1 versatel. Under \"Applications\", the \"Consumer\" subcategory lists brands like GMX, WEB.DE, mail.com, and united internet media. The \"Business\" subcategory under \"Applications\" includes home.pl, arsys, STRATO, IONOS, fasthosts, world4you Im Web daheim, sedo.com Buy, Park, Sell, Domains, united domains, and we22.\n\n#### **Divisions, segments and brands (as of: December 31, 2023)**\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Management\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Management Board members as at December 31, 2023**\n\n- Ralph Dommermuth, founder and Chief Executive Officer (with the Company since 1988)\n- Ralf Hartings, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (with the United Internet Group since 2021)\n- Markus Huhn, Management Board member responsible for Shared Services (with the United Internet Group since 1994)\n\n#### **Departed in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n Martin Mildner, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (with the Company from October 1, 2020 to March 31, 2023)\n\nThe Supervisory Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Supervisory Board members as at December 31, 2023**\n\n- Philipp von Bismarck, Chairman (member since July 2020; Chairman since May 2021; member of the Audit and Risk Committee since May 2021)\n- Dr. Manuel Cubero del Castillo-Olivares, Deputy Chairman (member since May 2020; Deputy Chairman since May 2021)\n- Stefan Rasch (member since May 2021; member of the Audit and Risk Committee since May 2021)\n- Prof. Dr. Franca Ruhwedel (member since May 2023; member of the Audit and Risk Committee since May 2023)\n- Prof. Dr. Andreas Söffing (member since May 2021; Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee since May 2021)\n- Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei-Yee Weiß (member since July 2020)\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Main markets and competitive standing\n\nGermany is the most important sales market of the United Internet Group by far and accounted for around 89% of total global sales in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nBesides Germany, the Group's most important sales markets are\n\n- the USA,\n- the UK,\n- Spain,\n- France,\n- Poland, and\n- Austria.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Consumer Access segment**\n\nFollowing the merger with Drillisch AG (now 1&1 AG) in 2017, United Internet is the fourth force in Germany's telecommunications market with landline and mobile products in its purely domestic Consumer Access segment – based on customer contracts and sales revenues – after Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefónica Germany.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Business Access segment**\n\nUnited Internet is also a leading company in its Business Access segment, whose operations are also limited to Germany. With the fiber-optic network of 1&1 Versatel spanning over 61,000 km, United Internet operates one of Germany's largest fiber-optic networks.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Consumer Applications segment**\n\nIn its Consumer Applications segment, United Internet operates in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria via the GMX and WEB.DE brands, as well as in countries such as the USA, UK, France, and Spain via the international brand mail.com. United Internet is the leading provider of e-mail services and one of the leaders in cloud services in its domestic German market – based on the number of users.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the globally aligned Business Applications segment, United Internet is active in a total of 18 countries with its hosting and cloud applications. The Company has long been the market leader in the German hosting business – based on the number of managed country domains – and strengthened its position in 2017 with the takeover of its competitor STRATO. In other European countries, United Internet's hosting applications are now available in all major markets – either locally or from Germany. In addition to the domestic German market, these mainly include the major European economies of France, the UK, Italy, Poland, and Spain. With the exception of Italy, the Company is among the market leaders –\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeasured by the number of managed country domains – in the aforementioned countries. All in all, therefore, United Internet is also one of the leading European suppliers of hosting applications – based on the number of managed country domains. Further target markets outside Europe are the North American countries Canada, USA, and Mexico. In the most important of these markets, the USA, United Internet is also one of the leading players in this segment – based on the number of managed country domains.\n\nFrom a global perspective, United Internet is thus also one of the leading companies in the hosting business.\n\n# Main locations\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the United Internet Group employed a total of 10,962 people worldwide at around 40 domestic and foreign facilities.\n\n| Location                                        | Segment               | Main Company                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Montabaur (HQ)                                  | Corporate functions   | United Internet               |\n|                                                 | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n| Karlsruhe                                       | Corporate functions   | United Internet               |\n|                                                 | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Consumer Applications | 1&1 Mail & Media Applications |\n|                                                 | Business Applications | IONOS                         |\n| Berlin                                          | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Business Access       | 1&1 Versatel                  |\n|                                                 | Business Applications | IONOS, Strato, we22           |\n| Dusseldorf                                      | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Business Access       | 1&1 Versatel                  |\n| Cebu City (Philippines)                         | Business Applications | IONOS                         |\n| Madrid / Logroño / Barcelona / Lugo ...

Such a business model ensures generally stable and plannable revenue and cash flows, protects against macroeconomic effects, and provides the financial scope to grasp opportunities in new or extended business fields and new or extended markets – organically, or via acquisitions and investments.\n\nThe large number of customer relationships helps the Company to utilize so-called economies of scale: the more customers using the products created by its development teams and operated at its own data centers, and/or transport data via its own networks, the greater the profit will be. These profits can then be invested in new customers, new developments, and new or extended business fields.\n\nFrom the current perspective, Cloud Applications and Mobile Internet will be the growth markets over the coming years. With its clear positioning in the Access and Applications segments, United Internet is well placed to exploit the expected market potential.\n\nIn view of the dynamic market development of Cloud Applications and Mobile Internet, the Company's growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. These internet-based programs for private users and companies will also be United Internet's growth drivers in the years ahead – both as stand-alone products in the Applications division, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in the Access division.\n\nWith its many years of experience as an access and application provider, its expertise in software development and data center operation, marketing, sales and customer support, as well as its strong and well-known brands (such as 1&1, GMX and WEB.DE), and customer relationships with millions of private users, freelancers, and small companies in Germany and abroad (currently over 68 million user accounts worldwide), the Company is excellently positioned.\n\nIn order to leverage this positioning for further sustainable growth, United Internet will continue to invest heavily in new customers, new products, and new or extended business fields, as well as in its further internationalization.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, United Internet also continuously seeks possibilities for company acquisitions, investments, and partnerships in order to extend its market positions, vertical integration levels, and expertise.\n\nThanks to its high and plannable level of free cash flow, United Internet has a strong source of internal funding as well as good access to debt financing markets. Further information on the Company's equity strength and external financing is presented in the chapters 2.2 \"Business development\" and 2.3 \"Position of the Group\".\n\nFurther information on strategy, opportunities and targets is included in the \"Risk, Opportunity and Forecast Report\" in chapter 4.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.3 Management systems\n\nThe internal management systems help the management team steer and monitor the Group and its segments. The systems consist of planning, actual situation, and forecast calculations based on the Group's annually revised strategic planning. Particular attention is paid to market developments, technological developments, and trends, as well as their impact on the Group's own products and services, and the Group's financial possibilities. The corporate management system's aim is the continuous and sustainable development of United Internet and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's reporting system comprises the monthly profit calculations and quarterly IFRS-compliant reports for all consolidated subsidiaries. It presents the financial position and performance of the Group and all divisions. Financial reporting also includes other detailed information which is required for the assessment and control of the operating business.\n\nQuarterly reports on significant risks for the Company represent a further component of the management systems.\n\nThe above mentioned reports are discussed at meetings of the Management Board and Supervisory Board and provide the fundamental basis for assessments and decisions.\n\nIn order to steer the Group's performance, United Internet AG uses in particular the key figures of the income statement (sales, EBITDA, EBIT, EPS), of the statement of cash flows (free cash flow), and of the statement of financial position (asset items, financial liabilities).\n\nInformation on the use and definition of the relevant key financial figures is presented in chapter 2.2 \"Business development\".\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG steers the segments mainly on the basis of key performance figures. It measures the success of each segment primarily according to sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).\n\nThe main non-financial key figures used are the number and growth of fee-based customer contracts, as well as ad-financed free accounts.\n\nThe performance indicators of the United Internet Group for top management are also presented in \"Segment reporting\" under note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) used by top management at Group level are sales and operating (i.e., adjusted for special items) EBITDA according to IFRS. These figures are also used in forecast reporting.\n\nDue to its role as the holding company, United Internet AG (parent company) is mainly influenced by its investment result (profit transfers and dividends) and interest result and therefore focuses on its investment result and net income.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of customer contracts, the gross and net sales figures, and the related customer acquisition costs in particular - compared to the Company's plans and forecast calculations - serve as an early warning system.\n\nThe KPIs used in the fiscal year 2023 were unchanged from the previous year.\n\nA comparison of the KPIs stated in the forecast and the actual figures is provided in this Management Report in chapter 2.2 \"Business Development\" in the section \"Actual and Forecast Development\".\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\n\nThe disclosures made in the subsection \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" are \"nonaudited management report disclosures\", as the content of \"non-management report-related disclosures\" is not audited. \n\nAs an internet service provider, the United Internet Group does not engage in research and development (R&D) on a scale comparable with manufacturing companies. Also within the context of its own sector, research and development expenditures play a fairly subordinate role. Against this backdrop, United Internet does not disclose key figures for R&D.\n\nAt the same time, the United Internet brands stand for high-performance internet access, solutions, and innovative web-based products and applications which are mostly developed in-house. The success of United Internet is rooted in an ability to develop, combine, or adapt innovative products and services, and launch them on major markets.\n\nThanks to its high-performance development centers (especially in Karlsruhe, Berlin, and Bucharest) with around 3,800 programmers, product managers, and technical administrators (corresponding to around 35% of all employees), United Internet is able to react swiftly and flexibly to new ideas and trends, and to continuously enhance its established products by adapting them to changing market needs – a key success factor in the fast-moving internet market. The Company's expertise in product development, enhancement, and rollout minimizes its reliance on third party development work and supplies in many areas, and thus ensures decisive competitive and time-to-market advantages.\n\nDue to the steady growth in customer figures, the demands placed on reliability and availability are constantly rising. In addition to the further development of existing products and continuous optimization of back-end operations, the Company also focuses on continuously enhancing existing processes in order to raise system reliability, and thus also customer satisfaction.\n\n# Focus areas 2023\n\n## **Consumer Access**\n\n- With the launch of mobile services in 1&1's mobile network in December 2023, 1&1 established the key prerequisites for extending its vertical integration in this market segment – as in the landline segment; 1&1 has since been producing advance services for new customers in its own network; wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient network coverage during the network rollout, it uses the national roaming advance services of Telefónica and, from summer 2024, of Vodafone; as of the beginning of 2024, existing 1&1 customers on third-party networks are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network.\n- Extension of \"1&1 5G at home\" with addition of conventional telephony, making it a complete replacement for DSL, cable or fiber-optic home connections\n- Simplification of process for multiple orders of mobile products from business customers\n- Implementation and start-up of a new omnichannel platform (Customer Operations)\n- Process enhancements and implementations in connection with the German Telecommunications Modernization Act (TKMoG)\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Extensive enhancements and improvements to fiber-optic customer communication and optimization of customer processes\n- Implementation and launch of 1&1 Cinema as a video-on-demand service; usage via TV app or together with IPTV\n- Expansion of products, ordering options and services for business customers\n- Standardization of order communication: platform for text-based order communication was revamped and standardized; to improve comprehensibility, customers now receive all order documents in a standardized form and based on the shopping cart display\n- Creation of a new platform for landline products at Drillisch Online\n\n## **Business Access**\n\n- Launch of Cloud PBX product \"1&1 Business Phone\" in cooperation with NFON\n- Introduction of \"1&1 Fiber Connect Basic\" product for smart clusters in business parks\n- \"1&1 Connected Calls for MS Teams\" as a simple telephone system and access to the public telephone network with Microsoft Teams\n- Expansion of the \"1&1 Business Phone\" product to include hospitality as a cloud PBX industry solution for the hospitality and trade sectors\n- Launch of an internet product for customer locations abroad\n- Implementation of a multichannel order management system for fully digitalized order entry across all sales segments\n- Extensive expansion and optimization of customer processes\n- Integration of further advance service products to increase the fiber-optic footprint in Germany\n\n## **Consumer Applications**\n\n- Launch of \"United Internet Media Ad Manager\" to improve internal and external control and creation of online campaigns\n- Implementation of a modern Customer Care Suite for the GMX and WEB.DE brands that raises degree of automation in processing and can be flexibly adapted\n- Expansion of upselling order lines in mobile applications to effectively support sales campaigns\n- Launch of a new e-mail web client (read use case) for GMX and WEB.DE\n- Extension of the AI-based categorized mail inbox (One Inbox)\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Launch of \"Account Recovery Assistant\" that provides customers with highly automated support in the event of access problems\n- Implementation of \"Effective Settings\", a centralized high-load platform for applying business rules to products and advertising across the company, based on consent, contract data, and legal frameworks\n- Conversion of the cashback platform from WebCents to EUR cents and addition of a credit card that users can also use offline to collect cents\n- Optimization of advertising by using AI to calculate prospecting scores\n- Launch of a lead generation system to enable customers to sign up for new newsletters from their inbox\n\n## **Business Applications**\n\n- Extension of \"Database-as-a-Service\" with MongoDB as document-based NoSQL database\n- Replacement of HDD storage with SSD products for higher storage performance, efficiency and packing density\n- Extension of Virtual Network Services with Managed NAT Gateway, Managed Network Load Balancer, Managed Application Load Balancer and Cloud DNS\n- Launch of IPv6 in native network stack\n- Launch of open source solution \"Managed Stackable\" (by IONOS and Stackable) as first Managed Big Data product\n- Launch of STRATO Virtual Dedicated Server based on IONOS Cloud Compute\n- Launch of STRATO V-Server based on IONOS Cloud (CoreVPS/Cubes)\n- Launch of HiDrive4You as new STRATO cloud storage tariff\n- Introduction of AI solutions in website builder and domain search\n- Launch of virtual CPUs as new compute type\n- Introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as first commercial Linux operating system\n- Launch of new platform services: Private Node Pools for Managed Kubernetes, Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning, and Logging-as-a-Service\n- Launch of a new managed server generation based on Alma Linux at STRATO\n- Introduction of ServerGuard24 for STRATO server products\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2. ECONOMIC REPORT\n\n# 2.1 General economic and sector conditions\n\n# General economic development\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for 2023 slightly during the course of the year. In its latest economic outlook (World Economic Outlook, Update January 2024), the IMF reported growth of 3.1% for the global economy in 2023, based on preliminary calculations. Growth was thus below the prior-year level (3.5%) but at the same time 0.2 percentage points above the IMF's original outlook of January 2023 (2.9%).\n\nIn the United Internet Group's target markets in North America, growth rates varied somewhat. The IMF anticipates growth of 2.5% for the USA (prior year: 1.9%), and thus 1.1 percentage points more than in its January outlook for 2023 (1.4%). However, the calculated growth of 1.1% for Canada (prior year: 3.8%) is 0.4 percentage points less than originally expected (1.5%). And for Mexico, the IMF forecasts an increase in economic output of 3.4% (prior year: 3.9%), and thus 1.7 percentage points more than anticipated at the beginning of the year (1.7%).\n\nThe picture is much gloomier in the eurozone region, where all countries of importance for United Internet displayed much weaker growth than in 2022. The IMF now expects overall growth of 0.5% (prior year: 3.4%) for the eurozone and thus a further 0.2 percentage points less than it forecast in January (0.7%). Growth of 0.8% was calculated for France (prior year: 2.5%), 0.7% for Italy (prior year: 3.7%), and 2.4% for Spain (prior year: 5.8%). This corresponds to an improvement of 0.1 percentage points each for France and Italy, and 1.3 percentage points for Spain, compared to the January outlook (France: 0.7%; Italy: 0.6%; Spain: 1.1%). And for Poland, the IMF expects growth of 0.6% (prior year: 5.3%).\n\nFor the UK, a non-EU country, the IMF expects growth of 0.5% (prior year: 4.3%), and thus 1.1 percentage point more than at the beginning of the year (-0.6%).\n\nThe economic development in Germany – United Internet's most important market by far (sales share 2023: around 89%) – was much slower than in the previous year and also below the IMF's original expectations. The IMF has calculated that economic output in Germany decreased by -0.3% (prior year: 1.8%) and was thus a further -0.4 percentage points below expectations at the beginning of the year (0.1%).\n\nThe IMF's calculations for Germany are therefore in line with the preliminary figures of the country's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), which – at its \"GDP 2023\" press conference on January 15, 2024 – also announced a decline in (price-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) of -0.3% for 2023. This is 2.1 percentage points less than in 2022 (1.8%). According to the Federal Statistical Office, this was due to further inflation-related high prices throughout the economy, unfavorable borrowing conditions caused by rising interest rates and an overall decline in both domestic and foreign demand.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n|          | January<br>forecast<br>2023 | April<br>forecast<br>2023 | July<br>forecast<br>2023 | October<br>forecast<br>2023 | Actual<br>2023 | Change on<br>January forecast |\n|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| World    | 2.9%                        | 2.8%                      | 3.0%                     | 3.0%                        | 3.1%           | +0.2%-points                  |\n| USA      | 1.4%                        | 1.6%                      | 1.8%                     | 2.1%                        | 2.5%           | +1.1%-points                  |\n| Canada   | 1.5%                        | 1.5%                      | 1.7%                     | 1.3%                        | 1.1%           | -0.4%-points                  |\n| Mexico   | 1.7%                        | 1.8%                      | 2.6%                     | 3.2%                        | 3.4%           | +1.7%-points                  |\n| Eurozone | 0.7%                        | 0.8%                      | 0.9%                     | 0.7%                        | 0.5%           | -0.2%-points                  |\n| France   | 0.7%                        | 0.7%                      | 0.8%                     | 1.0%                        | 0.8%           | +0.1%-points                  |\n| Spain    | 1.1%                        | 1.5%                      | 2.5%                     | 2.5%                        | 2.4%           | +1.3%-points                  |\n| Italy    | 0.6%                        | 0.7%                      | 1.1%                     | 0.7%                        | 0.7%           | +0.1%-points                  |\n| UK       | -0.6%                       | -0.3%                     | 0.4%                     | 0.5%                        | 0.5%           | +1.1%-points                  |\n| Germany  | 0.1%                        | -0.1%                     | -0.3%                    | -0.5%                       | -0.3%          | -0.4%-points                  |\n\n#### **Changes in growth forecasts made during 2023 for United Internet's key target countries and regions**\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2023, April 2023, July 2023, October 2023 and January 2024\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: GDP trend in United Internet's key target countries and regions**\n\n|          | 2019  | 2020   | 2021 | 2022 | 2023  | YoY change   |\n|----------|-------|--------|------|------|-------|--------------|\n| World    | 2.8%  | -3.1%  | 6.2% | 3.5% | 3.1%  | -0.4%-points |\n| USA      | 2.2%  | -3.4%  | 5.9% | 1.9% | 2.5%  | +0.6%-points |\n| Canada   | 1.9%  | -5.2%  | 5.0% | 3.8% | 1.1%  | -2.7%-points |\n| Mexico   | -0.1% | -8.2%  | 4.7% | 3.9% | 3.4%  | -0.5%-points |\n| Eurozone | 1.3%  | -6.4%  | 5.3% | 3.4% | 0.5%  | -2.9%-points |\n| France   | 1.5%  | -8.0%  | 6.8% | 2.5% | 0.8%  | -1.7%-points |\n| Spain    | 2.0%  | -10.8% | 5.5% | 5.8% | 2.4%  | -3.4%-points |\n| Italy    | 0.3%  | -8.9%  | 6.7% | 3.7% | 0.7%  | -3.0%-points |\n| Poland   | 4.4%  | -2.0%  | 6.9% | 5.3% | 0.6%  | -4.7%-points |\n| UK       | 1.4%  | -9.4%  | 7.6% | 4.3% | 0.5%  | -3.8%-points |\n| Germany  | 0.6%  | -4.6%  | 2.6% | 1.8% | -0.3% | -2.1%-points |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of price-adjusted GDP in Germany**\n\n|     | 2019 | 2020  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023  | YoY change   |\n|-----|------|-------|------|------|-------|--------------|\n| GDP | 1.1% | -3.8% | 3.2% | 1.8% | -0.3% | -2.1%-points |\n\nSource: Destatis, January 2024\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Development of sector / core markets\n\nAt its annual press conference on January 10, 2024, the industry association Bitkom assumed growth of 2.0% (prior year: 6.8%) to € 215.0 billion for the German ICT market in 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the association was still anticipating revenue growth of 3.8% for 2023. Nevertheless, the digital sector is proving highly robust once again – despite the adverse macroeconomic environment dominated by geopolitical crises, disrupted supply chains, and skilled labor shortages.\n\nThe increase in the overall ICT market resulted in particular from growth in sales of information technology. According to Bitkom's 2023 forecast, sales in this largest submarket – and of particular importance for United Internet – rose by 2.2% (prior year: 8.7%) to € 142.9 billion, compared to a growth forecast of 6.3% at the beginning of 2023. The various segments of this sub-market made varied progress: software grew by 9.6% (prior year: 15.0%) and IT services by 5.1% (prior year: 8.5%), while IT hardware fell by -5.4% (prior year: 4.8%) following the disproportionately high level of investment during the pandemic.\n\nThere was also good progress in the telecommunications submarket. For this second core market of United Internet, the industry association expects growth in 2023 of 1.7% (prior year: 3.4%) to € 72.1 billion – compared to its forecast at the beginning of 2022 of 0.9%. Growth in the individual segments of the telecommunications market was also quite varied: whereas the infrastructure business (driven by the 5G network rollout) grew by 4.4% (prior year: 14.2%) and telecommunication services by 1.9% (prior year: 2.1%), sales of user devices fell by -0.7% (prior year: 2.4%).\n\nThe smallest sub-market, consumer electronics (of no significance for United Internet), continued its decline and decreased by -2.1% (prior year: -7.2%) to € 8.1 billion.\n\nThe most important ICT markets for United Internet's business model are the German telecommunications market (broadband connections and mobile internet) in its mostly subscriptionfinanced Access division, as well as the global cloud computing market, and the German online advertising market for its subscription- and ad-financed Applications division.\n\n## **(Stationary) broadband market in Germany**\n\nIn view of the high level of household coverage already achieved and the strong trend toward mobile internet usage, demand for new landline-based broadband connections in Germany has slowed in recent years. With expected growth of 0.2 million, or 0.5%, to 37.0 million in 2023, the number of new connections was again at a moderate level. These figures were calculated by the Association of Telecommunications and Value-Added Service Providers (Verband der Anbieter von Telekommunikations- und Mehrwertdiensten – VATM) and Dialog Consult in their joint \"25th TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023\" (November 2023). The connections currently of relevance for United Internet in the two technology fields of DSL and FTTB/FTTH (fiber-optic) performed very differently: whereas DSL connections in Germany fell by 0.4 million to 24.3 million, fiber-optic connections grew by 0.8 million to 4.2 million. The number of cable connections also fell by 0.2 million to 8.5 million.\n\nAccording to estimates of Dialog Consult/VATM, revenues generated in the landline business in 2023 were unchanged from the previous year at € 32.6 billion. In addition to retail sales, these revenue figures also include wholesale, interconnection, and terminal device revenues.\n\nAt the same time, however, calculations of Dialog Consult/VATM indicate that the average volume of data used is rising much more strongly than the number of newly activated connections and landline \n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nrevenues – as an indicator of continued growth in usage of e.g., IPTV and cloud applications – with growth of 16.1% to 320.9 GB (per connection and month).\n\nAs a result, demand for more powerful broadband connections also developed strongly. For example, the proportion of switched broadband connections with (downstream) speeds of at least 50 Mbit/s increased by 3.2 percentage points, from 58.7% in the previous year to 61.9% (of all broadband connections) in 2023. There was even stronger growth in fixed-line connections with speeds of at least 250 Mbit/s, which raised their share by 5.1 percentage points to 23.0% (of all broadband connections).\n\n#### **Key market figures: fixed-line in Germany**\n\n|                                    | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Fixed-line revenues (in € billion) | 32.6 | 32.6 | 0.0%   |\n\nSource: Dialog Consult / VATM, TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023, November 2023\n\n## **Mobile internet market in Germany**\n\nAccording to estimates of Dialog Consult / VATM, the number of active SIM cards in the German mobile communications market increased by 12.9 million, or 7.6%, to 181.9 million in 2023. This growth is attributable to so-called M2M SIM cards (machine-to-machine SIM cards), which are used, for example, for the automated exchange of information between machines, vending machines, vehicles, etc. and/or with a central control station, which increased by 12.0 million to 70.3 million. The number of active personal SIMs (active = used in the last three months) rose only slightly by 0.5 million to 104.9 million – thus indicating a largely saturated market, as the figures for the past few years have shown.\n\nDialog Consult / VATM calculates that total revenues in the German mobile communications market increased by 0.4% from € 27.5 billion to € 27.6 billion in 2023 (including interconnection, wholesale, and user device revenues). Service revenues rose by 1.0% to € 21.1 billion, while other revenues (which include interconnection, wholesale, and user device revenues) decreased by 3.0% to € 6.4 billion.\n\nAccording to forecasts of Dialog Consult/VATM, the average volume of data used (per connection and month) - as an indicator of the growing use of mobile data services - grew much faster than the number of active personal SIM cards and mobile revenues by 22.1% to 6.57 GB.\n\n#### **Key market figures: mobile communications in Germany**\n\n|                                | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Mobile revenues (in € billion) | 27.6 | 27.5 | + 0.4% |\n| thereof service sales          | 21.1 | 20.9 | + 1.0% |\n| thereof other sales            | 6.4  | 6.6  | - 3.0% |\n\nSource: Dialog Consult / VATM, TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023, November 2023\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Global cloud computing market**\n\nThere was further dynamic growth in the cloud computing market in 2023. In its \"Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update\" (November 2023), Gartner Inc. forecasts global growth for public cloud services of 17.8% in 2023, from USD 478.32 billion to USD 563.59 billion.\n\nOver the past years, cloud technology has evolved from a useful and competitive business tool to a key enterprise enabler.\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic conditions and high inflationary pressure, the coronavirus pandemic in particular has accelerated the digitalization process across numerous sectors since 2020. Most companies now regard new technologies as essential tools for coping with the crises. Within just a short period of time, for example, thousands of employees working from home were connected, new digital channels for sales and support were opened, and a large number of systems and data were moved to the cloud.\n\nAs a result, the migration of data, applications, and infrastructure to the cloud has become an integral part of most digital transformation strategies, with the aim of creating more agile and adaptable operations.\n\nGrowth is particularly strong at present in the field of IaaS, as companies accelerate their IT modernization initiatives in order to minimize risks and optimize costs. Moving operations to the cloud reduces current capital expenditures by spreading them over the life of a cloud subscription - a key advantage in an environment where liquidity can be critical to maintaining operations.\n\n| in \\$ billion                                      | 2023   | 2022   | Change  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Global sales of public cloud services              | 563.59 | 478.32 | + 17.8% |\n| thereof Application Infrastructure Services (PaaS) | 145.32 | 119.58 | + 21.5% |\n| thereof Application Services (SaaS)                | 205.22 | 174.42 | + 17.7% |\n| thereof Business Process Services (BPaaS)          | 66.34  | 61.56  | + 7.8%  |\n| thereof Desktop as a Service (DaaS)                | 2.78   | 2.43   | + 14.6% |\n| thereof System Infrastructure Services (IaaS)      | 143.93 | 120.33 | + 19.6% |\n\n#### **Key market figures: cloud computing worldwide**\n\nSource: Gartner, Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update, November 2023\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **German online advertising market**\n\nIn its study \"German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 - 2027\" (September 2023), the auditing and consultancy company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecasts an increase in total revenues (paid search, display, video, affiliate / classifieds) of the German online advertising market (mobile advertising and desktop advertising) of 7.0% from € 12.58 billion to € 13.47 billion for 2023 – following growth of 6.0% in 2022.\n\n| Key market figures: total online advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to PWC |       |       |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| in € billion                                                                                                            | 2023  | 2022  | Change |\n| Online advertising revenues                                                                                             | 13.47 | 12.58 | + 7.0% |\n\nSource: PricewaterhouseCoopers, German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 – 2027, September 2023\n\nThe Online Marketing Group (OVK) of the German Association for the Digital Economy (BVDW) is somewhat more cautious than PwC in its assessment of the situation in the German online advertising market. The OVK only takes net revenues into account in its market figures and focuses on the most important sub-market for United Internet, the display advertising market (mobile and desktop). The definition of the display advertising market comprises in-page advertising, including out-stream advertising and in-stream video advertising. Keyword-based paid search, affiliate or newsletter marketing, advertising for apps in the app store, and in-game advertising, by contrast, are not included in the OVK model.\n\nBased on its updated forecast in September 2023, the OVK anticipates - in its OVK Report 2023/02 an increase in net revenues of the display advertising market from € 5.18 billion in the previous year to € 5.47 billion. This represents an increase of 5.6%, compared to growth of 1.1% in the previous year. In spring 2023, the Online Marketing Group (OVK) had forecast an increase in net revenues of 4.6%.\n\n#### **Key market figures: display advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to OVK**\n\n| in € billion                 | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Display advertising revenues | 5.47 | 5.18 | + 5.6% |\n\nSource: Online-Vermarkterkreis (OVK), OVK-Report 2023/02, September 2023\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Legal conditions / significant events\n\nThe legal parameters for United Internet's business activities remained largely unchanged from the previous year in 2023 and had no significant influence on the development of the United Internet Group.\n\n## **Legal conditions**\n\nOne of the factors determining the future success of United Internet subsidiary 1&1 as a mobile network operator is the future allocation of mobile communication frequencies (spectrum). As part of the German Federal Network Agency's spectrum auction in 2019, 1&1 acquired 5G spectrum in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands. The frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band are already available and are being used for mobile network operations, while the frequencies in the 2 GHz band will be available from 2026. In order to bridge this period, 1&1 has leased further spectrum in the 2.6 GHz band from Telefónica.\n\nIn order to be able to operate its mobile network competitively and efficiently, 1&1 – as well as all other mobile network operators – not only requires high-frequency spectrum but also so-called low-band frequencies, which are essential for indoor coverage. Around 80% of data traffic is handled in this band.\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Network Agency once again addressed the topic of awarding low-band frequencies in the 800 MHz spectrum, which are due to expire in 2025. In a so-called consultation paper, it advocated a prolongation of the frequencies to the three incumbent network operators. In the past, spectrum was awarded exclusively via non-discriminatory auctions in Germany, and such a prolongation would be a novelty. In the event of such an award, 1&1 would not receive access to the low-band frequencies.\n\nThe German Federal Cartel Office also commented on the spectrum award situation in November 2023. In a position paper, the Federal Cartel Office stated that an extension of the frequencies without taking 1&1 into account would expose 1&1, as a market newcomer, to serious competitive disadvantages compared to the established mobile network operators. In its position paper, the Federal Cartel Office also points out, with reference to other European countries, that the available spectrum is sufficient for four mobile network operators.\n\nVarious studies published by 1&1 on the spectrum situation in Germany came to the same conclusion. They argue that the low-band frequencies are not always being used efficiently by the three other mobile network operators and that there is no discernible correlation between a high level of spectrum held by individual mobile network operators and the performance of their mobile networks, meaning that low-band frequencies could be allocated to all four mobile network operators without any loss of quality.\n\nIn an expert opinion commissioned by 1&1, the former Federal Constitutional Court judge and renowned legal expert, Prof. Udo Di Fabio, also clearly stated that the auctioning of the first 5G spectrum to a market newcomer in 2019 resulted in additional regulatory responsibility. Prolonging the spectrum usage rights of established network operators without taking 1&1 into account as a newcomer would violate the protection of legitimate expectations principle and the equality principle and would even be unconstitutional from several points of view.\n\nThe Federal Network Agency is expected to provide further information on the exact award modalities in 2024.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Significant events**\n\n## **IPO of IONOS**\n\nOn January 17, 2023, IONOS Group SE announced concrete plans for the IPO of IONOS as part of an \"intention to float\" (ITF) and completed its IPO on February 8, 2023. The shares of IONOS Group SE have since been listed on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) under ISIN: DE000A3E00M1, WKN: A3E00M, ticker symbol: IOS. United Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292 million from the sale of shares, while the entire placement volume amounted to around € 389 million. Following the IPO of IONOS Group SE, United Internet holds 63.8% and Warburg Pincus 21.2% of IONOS shares. 15.0% of shares are in free float.\n\n## **Acquisition of fiber-optic city networks from BT**\n\nIn early July 2023, 1&1 Versatel acquired four fiber-optic city networks from BT. The acquisition of the BT city networks in Munich, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Stuttgart with a total length of 1,590 km is in line with 1&1 Versatel's strategy of steadily expanding its own fiber-optic network. The purchase price amounted to around € 42 million.\n\n## **Conclusion of binding heads of terms for a long-term exclusive national roaming partnership with Vodafone**\n\nIn August 2023, 1&1 concluded binding heads of terms with Vodafone for a long-term exclusive national roaming partnership.\n\nThe national roaming cooperation includes the non- discriminatory provision of national roaming services in areas not yet covered by the new 1&1 mobile network and comprises in particular access to Vodafone's 5G network including the mobile standards 2G and 4G, as well as future mobile standards and technologies.\n\nThe starting date for the Vodafone national roaming services will be one year after concluding the final national roaming cooperation, however no later than October 1, 2024. The basic term of the national roaming cooperation will be 5 years from that point on. 1&1 Mobilfunk will have the right to prolong the term of the national roaming cooperation up to twice by five further years each time – i.e., by up to an additional 10 years. The end of the contract term will be followed by a transition period of three years.\n\nThe calculation basis is a so-called capacity model, under which 1&1 will pay a fixed price per percentage point for the percentage share of the Vodafone network used by its customers. This fixed price changes from time to time in line with the percentage cost development of the Vodafone network. The conditions are thus geared to future market developments and enable 1&1 to make competitive offers over the long term.\n\n## **Addition of 5G to national roaming agreement with Telefónica**\n\nIn November 2023, 1&1 expanded the national roaming agreement it concluded with Telefónica Germany in May 2021 with the addition of 5G.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nWherever the 5G network currently under construction does not yet have its own coverage, 1&1 customers will automatically have access to Telefónica Germany's 2G/4G/5G network as part of the national roaming agreement expanded to include 5G. From October 2024 at the latest, 1&1 will use national roaming from Vodafone as planned and gradually reduce its advance services from Telefónica Germany.\n\n## **1&1 O-RAN: launch of mobile services in Europe's most modern 5G network**\n\nFollowing the launch of \"1&1 5G at home\" in December 2022, 1&1 activated its mobile services on December 8, 2023. Germany's fourth mobile network is thus now fully functional and can also be used with smartphones on the move.\n\nA condition for the activation of mobile services was the previously completed provision of 5G national roaming by Telefónica Germany. This means that 1&1 customers can now access Telefónica's 5G network wherever the 1&1 network, which is currently being set up, does not yet have its own coverage – automatically and without interruption. Vodafone is scheduled to provide 5G national roaming from summer 2024.\n\n1&1 is the first network operator in Europe to rely entirely on the new Open RAN technology. At the heart of the 1&1 network (\"1&1 O-RAN\") is a private cloud operated in hundreds of cities through decentralized edge data centers. All network functions are controlled by software running on conventional servers. 1&1 plans to use Gigabit antennas at all antenna locations, which are connected via fiber-optic cable to the 1&1 edge data centers. This network architecture enables minimal latency, which is essential for future real-time applications.\n\nUnlike traditional networks based on proprietary technology from specialized network suppliers, such as Huawei, the 1&1 O-RAN has a large number of standardized interfaces. This means that software and hardware components from the most innovative and secure providers can be flexibly combined. At the same time, it also eliminates 1&1's dependence on individual suppliers.\n\n## **Partial repayment of the shareholder loan by IONOS Group SE**\n\nIn December 2023, IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity. Following the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million and is subordinated. The shareholder loan continues to have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.75%, a term until December 15, 2026, and is to be gradually repaid before this date.\n\nThere were no other significant events in fiscal 2023 which had a material effect on the development of business.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.2 Business development\n\n# Segment reporting changed from \"controlling view\" to \"accounting view\"\n\nIn the course of preparing the Interim Financial Statements as at March 31, 2023, the Management Board decided to make a significant adjustment to its internal reporting system. As a consequence, this change also led to a revision of segment reporting with a shift in focus from the previous \"controlling view\" to the \"accounting view\". This decision was intended to strengthen the harmonization of the Company's internal controlling and external reporting. The change resulted in reconciliation effects/shifts in key sales and earnings figures among the segments.\n\n- Reconciliation effects on sales: certain intercompany sales are no longer consolidated at segment level (as previously in the controlling view), but only at Group level (accounting view).\n- Reconciliation effects on EBITDA and EBIT: depreciation allocations and profit margins for intercompany services are no longer \"netted\" between segments (as was previously the case for internal service charging in the controlling view) but are disclosed (accounting view) – as if \"booked\" at segment level.\n\nOverall, the change has no effect on the Group's sales and earnings figures, as reporting at Group level was already based on the \"accounting view\".\n\nBy making this change at segment level, United Internet is also taking account of the increasing independence of its segments (subgroups) and aligning segment reporting with the reporting of its listed and thus also reportable subgroups 1&1 AG (Consumer Access segment) and IONOS Group SE (Business Applications segment).\n\nA reconciliation of sales, as well as operating EBITDA and EBIT, for the preceding quarters Q1 2022 - Q4 2022 and the fiscal years 2019 - 2022 is presented in the Notes on the Interim Statement Q1 2023 (page 28 et seq.).\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Use and definition of relevant financial performance measures\n\nIn order to ensure the clear and transparent presentation of United Internet's business trend, the Group's Annual Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements include key financial performance measures - in addition to the disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) – such as EBITDA, the EBITDA margin, EBIT, the EBIT margin, and free cash flow.\n\nUnited Internet defines these measures as follows:\n\n- **EBIT:** Earnings before interest and taxes represents the operating result disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.\n- **EBIT margin:** Presents the ratio of EBIT to sales.\n- **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are calculated as EBIT/operating result plus the depreciation and amortization (disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements) of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as well as assets capitalized in the course of company acquisitions.\n- **EBITDA margin:** Presents the ratio of EBITDA to sales.\n- **Free cash flow:** Calculated as cash flow from operating activities (disclosed in the consolidated financial statement), less capital expenditure for intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, plus payments from the disposal of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\n\nInsofar as necessary for a clear and transparent presentation, these indicators are adjusted for special items and disclosed as \"key operating figures\" (e.g., operating EBITDA, operating EBIT, and operating EPS). A reconciliation of EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS (according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income) with figures adjusted for special items can be found in chapter 2.3 \"Position of the Group\".\n\nSuch special items usually refer solely to those effects capable of restricting the validity of the key financial performance measures with regard to the Group's financial and earnings performance – due to their nature, frequency, and/or magnitude. All special items are presented and explained for the purpose of reconciliation from the unadjusted key financial figures to the key operating figures in the relevant section of the financial statements.\n\nBy contrast, expenses for the 1&1 network rollout or start-up costs for new business fields of 1&1 Versatel are not adjusted but disclosed – should there be any – in the respective sections.\n\nCurrency-adjusted sales and earnings figures are calculated by converting sales and earnings figures with the average exchange rates of the comparative period, instead of the current period.\n\nThe most important key financial figures for managing the Group are sales and operating EBITDA according to IFRS.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Actual and forecast development 2023\n\nUnited Internet AG maintained its growth trajectory in the fiscal year 2023 and reached its guidance for the fiscal year 2023, as issued in March 2023 and updated in November 2023.\n\n## **Forecast development**\n\nIn an ad-hoc announcement on March 29, 2023, United Internet published its guidance for the fiscal year 2023 and updated it during the year as follows:\n\n|        | Forecast 2023<br>(March 2023)                              | Specification<br>(November 2023)                 |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Sales  | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion)           | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion) |\n| EBITDA | at the previous year's level(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion) | slight increase(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion)    |\n\n(1) This includes around € -120 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network\n\n## **Actual development**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, consolidated sales rose by 5.0%, from € 5.915 billion in the previous year to € 6.213 billion and were thus slightly above the sales forecast (March 2023: approx. € 6.2 billion).\n\nWithout consideration of non-cash valuation effects from derivatives (€ -0.5 million in the previous year; € -6.3 million in 2023) and additionally adjusted for IPO costs in connection with the IPO of Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE (€ -8.8 million in the previous year; € -1.7 million in 2023), operating EBITDA for the Group in the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 1.300 billion and was thus 2.2% above the comparable prior-year figure (€ 1.272 billion). As a result, EBITDA was above the original EBITDA forecast (\"on a par with the previous year\") and within the range of the EBITDA update (\"slight increase\") – despite higher expenses (€ -132.4 million) for the rollout of 1&1's mobile network than originally anticipated (approx. € -120 million).\n\n#### **Summary: actual and forecast development of business in 2023**\n\n|        | Forecast 2023<br>(March 2023)                              | Specification<br>(November 2023)                 | Actual<br>2023     |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Sales  | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion)           | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion) | € 6.213 billion    |\n| EBITDA | at the previous year's level(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion) | slight increase(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion)    | € 1.300 billion(2) |\n\n(1) This includes around € -120 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network (2) This includes € -132.4 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network\n\nNet income of United Internet AG (parent company) for the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 274.0 million (including a special item of € 219.1 million from income from the disposal of financial assets as a result of the sale of shares in Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE as part of the IONOS IPO). Without this special item, the parent company's net income for the year was \"in the mid-double-digit million range\" as forecast.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Development of divisions and segments\n\nThe Group's operating activities are divided into the business divisions Access and Applications, which in turn are divided into the segments Consumer Access and Business Access, as well as Consumer Applications and Business Applications.\n\nDetails on the business models of the individual segments are presented in chapter 1.1 \"Business model\".\n\n## **Consumer Access segment**\n\nIn addition to preparations for the launch of mobile services in the 1&1 mobile network, the Consumer Access segment once again focused on adding further valuable broadband and mobile internet contracts in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe total number of fee-based contracts in the Consumer Access segment rose by 480,000 contracts to 16.26 million in 2023. As expected, the number of broadband connections decreased by -90,000 to 4.01 million, but stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the reporting period, mobile internet contracts increased by 570,000 to 12.25 million.\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Access contracts in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n| in million                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Consumer Access, total contracts | 16.26         | 15.78         | + 0.48 |\n| thereof Mobile Internet          | 12.25         | 11.68         | + 0.57 |\n| thereof broadband connections    | 4.01          | 4.10          | - 0.09 |\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Access contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023**\n\n| in million                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2023 | Change |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|\n| Consumer Access, total contracts | 16.26         | 16.11          | + 0.15 |\n| thereof Mobile Internet          | 12.25         | 12.10          | + 0.15 |\n| thereof broadband connections    | 4.01          | 4.01           | 0.00   |\n\nSales of the Consumer Access segment rose by 3.4% in the fiscal year 2023, from € 3,963.7 million in the previous year to € 4,096.7 million.\n\nDue to good contract growth on the whole, high-margin service revenues – which represent the core business of the segment – rose by 2.1% from € 3,175.4 million in the previous year to € 3,243.2 million in 2023. Low-margin hardware sales rose by 8.3%, or € 65.2 million, from € 788.3 million to € 853.5 million. Hardware sales are subject to seasonal effects and also depend strongly on the appeal of new devices and the model cycles of hardware manufacturers. Consequently, this effect may be reversed in the coming quarters. If this is the case, however, it would have no significant impact on the segment's EBITDA trend.\n\nMainly as a result of the planned increase in costs for the rollout of 1&1's mobile communications network, segment EBITDA of € 653.8 million was 5.7% or € 39.5 million down on the previous year (€ 693.3 million). The expenses for network rollout included in this calculation amounted to € -132.4 million, compared to € -52.4 million in the previous year – corresponding to a year-on-year increase of € -80.0 million.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, segment EBIT was impacted by increased depreciation due to investments in the rollout of the 1&1 mobile network (€ -46.2 million). On the whole, segment EBIT of € 455.8 million was 14.8%, or € 79.1 million, below the prior-year figure (€ 534.9 million). Since the beginning of 2024, the increase in depreciation on investments – mainly due to the operational launch of 1&1's mobile network – is being offset by steadily increasing cost savings on advance services.\n\nThere was a corresponding decline in the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin from 17.5% in the previous year to 16.0% and from 13.5% in the previous year to 11.1%, respectively.\n\nThe number of employees increased by 5.0% in 2023 to 3,320 (prior year: 3,163).\n\n#### **Key sales and earnings figures in the Consumer Access segment (in € million)**\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/4 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing sales, service sales, other sales, EBITDA, and EBIT for 2023 and 2022.

Among other things, the network was connected with all national and international networks and the functionality of mobile services was checked with external customer groups.\n\nIn August 2023, 1&1 also agreed a long-term national roaming partnership with Vodafone. On the basis of this agreement, the national roaming services currently provided by Telefónica are to be gradually replaced from summer 2024. National roaming is required to provide coverage for over twelve million 1&1 mobile customers during the construction phase of the network in those areas where 1&1 does not yet have its own network coverage.\n\nThe 1&1 network is based on innovative OpenRAN technology. Hardware, software and services from a variety of partner companies are used in the 1&1 O-RAN. This makes 1&1 independent of dominant manufacturers such as Huawei. And unlike conventional networks, the 1&1 network is operated in a private cloud that is spread across hundreds of far edge data centers throughout Germany. 112 regional far edge data centers are already in operation, as are 23 decentralized edge data centers and two core data centers. All network functions are controlled by software running on market-standard servers. Gigabit antennas are used at all locations and connected to the regional far edge data centers via fiberoptic cable. This architecture enables minimal latency, which is essential for future real-time applications.\n\n1&1 is also making good progress with the construction of its antenna locations: the initial backlog caused by delivery shortfalls of its main supplier is now being gradually made up in cooperation with additionally commissioned expansion partners. At the end of 2023, 1&1 had 1,062 antenna locations (passive architecture). By the end of 2024, this figure is set to rise to approx. 3,000 locations for the installation of 5G high-performance antennas and connection to fiber-optic cable.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Access segment**\n\nSales in the Business Access segment rose by 3.8% from € 534.4 million in the previous year to € 564.0 million in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nDespite start-up costs for new business fields, segment EBITDA improved by 5.7% from € 154.1 million in the previous year to € 162.9 million in 2023. As a result, the EBITDA margin rose from 28.4% to 28.9%.\n\nIn the new \"5G\" business field, 1&1 Versatel is responsible for setting up data centers and fiber-optic connections for the antenna locations of 1&1's mobile network and providing them to 1&1 on a rental basis as part of an intercompany agreement. In its second new business field \"Expansion of business parks\", 1&1 Versatel uses newly constructed regional expansion clusters to provide fiber-optic connections for companies in business parks. In the fiscal year 2023, total start-up costs for the new business fields amounted to € -21.5 million (prior year: € -10.8 million) for EBITDA and € -65.2 million (prior year: € -20.6 million) for EBIT.\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned start-up costs for new business fields, as well as increased depreciation for the associated investments in network infrastructure, segment EBIT decreased from € -39.5 million in the previous year to € -51.5 million. Without consideration of the new business fields, segment EBIT improved from € -18.9 million in the previous year to € 13.7 million in 2023.\n\nThe number of employees increased by 13.9% in 2023 to 1,522 (prior year: 1,336).\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/6 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing sales, EBITDA, and EBIT for 2023 and 2022. Sales were 564.0 in 2023 and 543.4 in 2022, representing a +3.8% change. EBITDA was 162.9 in 2023 and 154.1 in 2022, representing a +5.7% change.

The acquisition of these city networks is in line with 1&1 Versatel's strategy of steadily expanding its own fiber-optic network. The purchase price amounted to around € 42 million.\n\n## **Consumer Applications segment**\n\nThe number of fee-based pay accounts (contracts) rose by 200,000 to 2.84 million in the fiscal year 2023. Ad-financed free accounts were 0.9% or 380,000 accounts down on December 31, 2022, due in particular to the successful conversion to fee-based customer relationships (200,000). As a result, the total number of Consumer Applications accounts decreased slightly by 0.4% or 180,000 accounts to 42.77 million in 2023.\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Applications accounts in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n| in million                                         | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Consumer Applications, total accounts              | 42.77         | 42.95         | - 0.18 |\n| thereof with Premium Mail subscription (contracts) | 2.05          | 1.89          | + 0.16 |\n| thereof with Value-Added subscription (contracts)  | 0.79          | 0.75          | + 0.04 |\n| thereof free accounts                              | 39.93         | 40.31         | - 0.38 |\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Applications accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023**\n\n| in million                                         | Dec. 31, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2023 | Change |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|\n| Consumer Applications, total accounts              | 42.77         | 42.55          | + 0.22 |\n| thereof with Premium Mail subscription (contracts) | 2.05          | 2.00           | + 0.05 |\n| thereof with Value-Added subscription (contracts)  | 0.79          | 0.78           | + 0.01 |\n| thereof free accounts                              | 39.93         | 39.77          | + 0.16 |\n\nRising advertising revenue and the growth in pay contracts led to a year-on-year increase in sales of the Consumer Applications segment of 5.4% to € 304.3 million (prior year: € 288.6 million).\n\nThere was also growth in the segment's key earnings figures: adjusted for non-cash valuation effects from derivatives of € -0.5 million in the previous year and € -6.3 million in 2023, **operating segment** EBITDA rose by 5.2% from € 104.4 million in the previous year to € 109.8 million in 2023 and operating segment EBIT by 5.8% from € 94.6 million to € 100.1 million.\n\nThe operating EBITDA margin and operating EBIT margin remained largely unchanged at 36.1% (prior year: 36.2%) and 32.9% (prior year: 32.8%), respectively.\n\nThe number of employees increased by 3.5% in 2023 to 1,072 (prior year: 1,036).\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Key sales and earnings figures in the Consumer Applications segment (in € million)**\n\nImage /page/34/Figure/1 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing Sales, EBITDA, and EBIT for 2023 and 2022.

After the successful completion of the takeover bid, United Internet contributed its Tele Columbus shares to Kublai in April 2021 and raised its stake in Kublai to 40%. The remaining 60% of shares are held by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners.\n\nKublai currently holds 95.39% of Tele Columbus shares.\n\nIn addition to Kublai GmbH and its other (fully consolidated) core operating companies, United Internet held the following other minority shareholdings as of December 31, 2023, which are included in its result from associated companies.\n\n## **Minority holdings in partner companies**\n\nIn July 2013, United Internet acquired a stake in Open-Xchange AG (main activity: e-mail and collaboration solutions). United Internet has already been working successfully with the company for many years in its Applications business. As of December 31, 2023, United Internet's share of voting rights amounted to 25.39%.

The share thus outperformed its comparative indices, which also rose year on year (DAX 20.3%; MDAX 8.0%).\n\nImage /page/38/Figure/3 description: This line graph titled \"Share performance 2023, indexed\" compares the share performance of United Internet, DAX, and MDAX from January to December. The y-axis represents the indexed share performance ranging from 60% to 130%, while the x-axis represents the months of the year. United Internet's share performance (red line) starts at 100% in January, rises to 115% in February, then declines sharply to around 70% by June and July, before rising again to approximately 122% in December. DAX's share performance (light gray line) starts at around 108% in January, fluctuates between 108% and 118% throughout the year, and ends at approximately 108% in December. MDAX's share performance (dark gray line) starts at 100% in January, rises to 114% in February, fluctuates between 106% and 116% until November, and then rises to 121% in December.\n\nThere was a corresponding increase in the market capitalization of United Internet AG from around € 3.66 billion in the previous year to around € 4.42 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, average daily trading via the XETRA electronic computer trading system amounted to around 410,000 shares (prior year: around 220,000) with an average value of € 7.1 million (prior year: € 5.8 million).\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: share performance**\n\n#### **(as of: December 31, 2023; in €; all stock exchange figures based on Xetra trading)**\n\n|                                | 2019         | 2020         | 2021         | 2022         | 2023         |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Closing price                  | 29.28        | 34.43        | 34.94        | 18.89        | 23.04        |\n| Performance                    | -23.4%       | + 17.6%      | + 1.5%       | -45.9%       | + 22.0%      |\n| Year-high                      | 40.42        | 43.88        | 39.34        | 35.45        | 23.06        |\n| Year-low                       | 24.21        | 20.76        | 31.63        | 18.14        | 12.54        |\n| Average daily turnover         | 16,415,087   | 13,355,218   | 8,149,290    | 5,777,474    | 7,078,087    |\n| Average daily turnover (units) | 522,809      | 414,786      | 233,717      | 221,596      | 413,556      |\n| Number of shares (units)       | 205 million  | 194 million  | 194 million  | 194 million  | 192 million  |\n| Market value                   | 6.00 billion | 6.68 billion | 6.78 billion | 3.66 billion | 4.42 billion |\n| EPS(1)                         | 2.13         | 1.55         | 2.23         | 1.97         | 1.35         |\n| Adjusted EPS(2)                | 1.88         | 1.87         | 2.11         | 2.00         | 1.41         |\n\n(1) EPS from continued operations\n\n(2) EPS from continued operations and without special items\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Share data                                            |                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Share type                                            | Registered common<br>stock |\n| Notional share of capital stock                       | € 1.00                     |\n| German Securities Identification Number (WKN)         | 508903                     |\n| International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) | DE0005089031               |\n| Ticker symbol Xetra                                   | UTDI                       |\n| Reuters ticker symbol                                 | UTDI.DE                    |\n| Bloomberg ticker symbol                               | UTDI.GR                    |\n| Segment                                               | Prime Standard             |\n| Index                                                 | MDAX, TecDAX               |\n| Sector                                                | Software                   |\n\n#### **Shareholder structure**\n\n| (as of: December 31, 2023)                                                                                                                                      |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Shareholder                                                                                                                                                     | Shareholding |\n| Ralph Dommermuth<br>- Ralph Dommermuth GmbH & Co.

Accordingly, only voting rights notifications that have reached at least the first notification threshold of 3% are taken into account. In addition, any directors' dealings announcements available to the Company have been taken into account accordingly.\n\nThe treasury shares held by United Internet do not carry voting or dividend rights. Due to the nonvoting nature of treasury shares, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by companies controlled by Mr. Dommermuth in relation to the total number of voting rights of United Internet AG amounts to 54.37%, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by Bank of America to 5.48%, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by Wellington to 3.35%, and the proportion of shares with voting rights in free float to 36.80%.\n\n## **Dividend**\n\nUnited Internet's dividend policy aims to pay a dividend to shareholders of approx. 20-40% of adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests (adjusted consolidated net income attributable to the \"shareholders of United Internet AG\" – according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income), provided that funds are not needed for further Company development.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG held on May 17, 2023, the proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board to pay a dividend of € 0.50 per share (prior year: € 0.50) for the fiscal year 2022, was approved with a majority of 99.93% of votes cast. As a consequence, a total of € 86.4 million (prior year: € 93.4 million) was distributed on May 23, 2023. The payout ratio was thus 23.5% of the adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests for 2022 (€ 374.1 million) and – in view of the investments already made and still due to be made in the Company's own mobile communications network and in the expansion of its own fiber-optic network – therefore within the range targeted by the dividend policy.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG will propose to the Supervisory Board a dividend of € 0.50 per share (prior year: € 0.50). The Management Board and Supervisory Board will discuss this dividend proposal at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 20, 2024 (and thus after the preparation deadline for this Management Report). The Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG on May 17, 2024 will then vote on whether to adopt the joint proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nOn the basis of around 172.8 million shares with dividend entitlement (as of December 31, 2023), the total dividend payment for fiscal year 2023 would amount to € 86.4 million. The dividend payout ratio would therefore be 35.6% of adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests for 2023 (€ 243.0 million) and thus lie – despite the investments already made and still due to be made in the Company's own mobile communications network and in the expansion of its own fiber-optic network – within the upper range of the dividend policy. Based on the closing price of the United Internet share on December 31, 2023, the dividend yield would be 2.2%.\n\n|                                 | For 2019 | For 2020 | For 2021 | For 2022 | For 2023(1) |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Dividend per share (in €)       | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50        |\n| Dividend payment (in € million) | 93.9     | 93.6     | 93.4     | 86.4     | 86.4        |\n| Payout ratio                    | 22.2%    | 32.2%    | 22.4%    | 23.5%    | 37.1%       |\n| Adjusted payout ratio(2)        | 23.6%    | 26.7%    | 23.7%    | 23.1%    | 35.6%       |\n| Dividend yield(3)               | 1.7%     | 1.5%     | 1.4%     | 2.6%     | 2.2%        |\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: dividend development**\n\n(1) Subject to approval of Supervisory Board and Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2024\n\n(2) Without special items\n\n(3) As of: December 31\n\n## **Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2023**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG was held in Frankfurt am Main on May 17, 2023.\n\nOf the Company's registered capital stock of € 192,000,000.00, divided into192,000,000 no-par value shares, of which 19,183,705 treasury shares without voting rights, a total of 135,921,273 no-par value shares with the same number of voting rights were represented. Including the postal votes received for 956,726 no-par value shares, this corresponded to a total of 136,877,999 no-par value shares or 71.29% of the registered capital stock, or 79.20% of the registered capital stock less treasury shares.\n\nThe shareholders adopted all resolutions on the agenda requiring voting with large majorities.\n\n## **Capital stock and treasury shares**\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2022, United Internet AG held 7,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 3.75% of the capital stock at the time of 194,000,000 shares.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and on the basis of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 regarding the acquisition and use of treasury shares, to initially cancel two million treasury shares and to reduce the capital stock of United Internet AG by € 2 million from € 194 million to € 192 million. The number of shares issued decreased accordingly by two million shares, from 194 million shares to 192 million shares. The pro-rata amount of capital stock per issued share remained unchanged at € 1 per share. The cancellation of the treasury shares serves to increase the proportionate participation of United Internet shareholders. Following the cancellation of the aforementioned two\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion shares, United Internet AG initially held 5,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 2.75% of the Company's current capital stock.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG also decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9 million shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9 million. With the public share buyback offer, United Internet AG made use of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company on May 20, 2020, under which up to 10% of the Company's capital stock could be bought back by August 31, 2023. The shares bought back may be used for all of the purposes permitted under the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020. The shares may also be canceled.\n\nIn the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period. The offer was based on the buyback of up to 13.9 million shares in total. As the total number of shares for which the offer was accepted exceeded this maximum amount, the declarations of acceptance were considered on a pro rata basis, i.e., corresponding to the ratio of the maximum number of United Internet shares to be purchased pursuant to this offer, i.e., 13.9 million United Internet shares, to the aggregate number of United Internet shares tendered by United Internet shareholders for buyback.\n\nUpon completion of the above mentioned capital reduction by cancellation of 2 million treasury shares and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet holds 19,183,705 treasury shares as of December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares. In view of the offer price of € 21.00 per United Internet share, the purchase price for the buyback of 13,899,596 shares in total amounted to € 291.9 million. For further details, please refer to note 39 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Investor Relations**\n\nContinuous and transparent corporate communication with all capital market participants is important for United Internet. The Company aims to provide all target groups with timely information without discrimination. To this end, the Management Board and the Investor Relations department continued their regular discussions with institutional and private investors in the fiscal year 2023. The capital market was informed via the quarterly statements, half-year financial report and annual report, press and analyst conferences, as well as via various webcasts. The Company's management and Investor Relations department explained the Company's strategy and financial results in numerous one-on-one discussions at the Company's offices in Montabaur, as well as at roadshows and conferences in Europe and North America. In addition, over 15 national and international investment banks are in contact with the Company's Investor Relations department and regularly publish studies and comments on the Company's progress and share performance.\n\nApart from one-on-one meetings, shareholders and potential future investors can also receive the latest news around the clock via the Company's extensive and bilingual website (www.unitedinternet.de). In addition to the publication dates of financial reports, the dates and venues of investor conferences and roadshows are made publicly available at https://www.united-internet.de/investorrelations/finanzkalender.html. Online versions of the Annual Report and Sustainability Report are also provided on the corporate website.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Personnel report\n\nAs a telecommunications and internet company, United Internet is subject to the defining characteristics of the industry: rapid change, short innovation cycles, and fierce competition. United Internet AG has risen to these challenges with great success over many years now. One of the key factors for the success and growth of the United Internet Group are its dedicated and highly competent employees and executives with their entrepreneurial and autonomous approach to work. The Company therefore attaches great importance to a sustainable and balanced strategy across all aspects of its HR activities: from employee recruitment, to targeted entry-level and vocational training formats, tailored skills training programs, support with individual career paths, through to sustainable management development programs, and the long-term retention of executives, high potentials, and top performers.\n\nUnited Internet AG was once again recognized as a top employer in 2023. Based on an independent study of the \"Top Employers Institute\", United Internet received the \"TOP Employers Germany\" award – as in the preceding years. Certification is only awarded to organizations which offer staff attractive working conditions. Assessment is based on career opportunities, employer benefits, and working conditions, as well as training and development opportunities.\n\n## **Headcount and personnel expenses**\n\nIn the highly competitive market for skilled workers in the ICT sector, United Internet once again succeeded in recruiting top staff for its key positions and thus meeting the needs of its growing business. In addition to targeted employer branding, partnerships with education and training providers, and the positive impact of the Company's product brands, our successful recruitment efforts center around a candidate-friendly, highly competitive acquisition and selection process.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the number of employees increased year on year by 4.7%, or 488 employees, to 10,962 (prior year: 10,474). This increase was in line with the development of business and resulted mainly from the Consumer Access and Business Access segments due to the strong increase in headcount for the rollout of 1&1's mobile network and the expansion of 1&1 Versatel's fiber-optic network.\n\nHeadcount in Germany rose by 5.0% or 431 employees, to 8,981 as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: 8,550). The number of employees at the Group's non-German subsidiaries grew by 3.0%, or 57 employees, to 1,981 (prior year: 1,924).\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: headcount development by location(1); year-on-year change**\n\n|                    | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022   | 2023   | Change |\n|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees, total   | 9,374 | 9,638 | 9,975 | 10,474 | 10,962 | + 4.7% |\n| thereof in Germany | 7,761 | 7,929 | 8,199 | 8,550  | 8,981  | + 5.0% |\n| thereof abroad     | 1,613 | 1,709 | 1,776 | 1,924  | 1,981  | + 3.0% |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nFrom the segment perspective, there were 3,320 employees in the Consumer Access segment (prior year: 3,163), 1,522 in the Business Access segment (prior year: 1,336), 1,072 in the Consumer Applications segment (prior year: 1,036), and 4,364 in the Business Applications segment (prior year: 4,247).

As a result, the personnel expense ratio increased to 12.2%.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of personnel expenses; year-on-year change**\n\n|                         |  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | Change  |\n|-------------------------|--|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| in € million            |  |       |       |       |       |       |         |\n| Personnel expenses      |  | 552.8 | 592.3 | 645.4 | 675.5 | 760.0 | + 12.5% |\n| Personnel expense ratio |  | 10.6% | 11.0% | 11.4% | 11.4% | 12.2% |         |\n\nSales per employee, based on annual average headcount, amounted to approx. € 580k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: approx. € 579k).\n\n## **Diversity**\n\nRespect for diversity is a core aspect of United Internet's corporate culture. The reason for this is simple: only a workforce that mirrors the many different facets of society offers the best possible conditions for creativity and productivity, and makes employees – and the organization itself – unique. This unique diversity creates an incomparable wealth of potential ideas and innovations, increasing the Company's competitiveness and providing opportunities for all.\n\nAll United Internet employees are to be treated with respect and should receive the same opportunities, regardless of their nationality, ethnic origin, religion, ideological beliefs, gender and gender identity, age, disability, or sexual orientation and identity. Each employee should be able to find the area of activity and function in which they can make the most of their individual potential and talents.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employees by gender(1)**\n\n|       | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Women | 32%  | 32%  | 33%  | 32%  | 33%  |\n| Men   | 68%  | 68%  | 67%  | 68%  | 67%  |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nThe average age of the United Internet Group's employees at the end of fiscal year 2023 was around 40 (prior year: 39).\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employee age profile(1)**\n\n|         | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| < 30    | 23%  | 23%  | 22%  | 23%  | 20%  |\n| 30 – 39 | 34%  | 33%  | 33%  | 31%  | 32%  |\n| 40 – 49 | 27%  | 27%  | 27%  | 27%  | 28%  |\n| ≥ 50    | 16%  | 17%  | 18%  | 19%  | 20%  |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nEmployees of United Internet AG work in an international environment at around 40 sites around the world.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employees by country(1)**\n\n|                     | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Employees, total    | 9,374 | 9,638 | 9,975 | 10,474 | 10,962 |\n| thereof Germany     | 7,761 | 7,929 | 8,199 | 8,550  | 8,981  |\n| thereof France      | 3     | 3     | 4     | 7      | 8      |\n| thereof UK          | 233   | 251   | 251   | 246    | 273    |\n| thereof Austria     | 43    | 44    | 65    | 67     | 72     |\n| thereof Philippines | 360   | 395   | 392   | 468    | 464    |\n| thereof Poland      | 309   | 299   | 333   | 352    | 339    |\n| thereof Romania     | 195   | 217   | 229   | 242    | 261    |\n| thereof Spain       | 330   | 340   | 381   | 422    | 445    |\n| thereof USA         | 140   | 160   | 121   | 120    | 119    |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"Working Conditions and HR Strategy\", \"Training and Education\", \"Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", and \"Occupational Health and Safety, and Health Management\", please refer to the chapter \"Social Responsibility\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html).\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Liquidity and finance\n\nThe Group's financial strategy is primarily geared to the strategic business plans of its operating business units. In order to provide sufficient flexibility for further growth, United Internet therefore constantly monitors trends in funding opportunities arising on the financial markets. Various options for funding and potential for optimizing existing financial instruments are regularly reviewed. The main focus is on ensuring sufficient liquidity and the financial independence of the Group at all times. In addition to its own financial strength, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity reserves with core banks. The flexible use of these liquidity reserves enables efficient management of Group liquidity, as well as optimal debt management to reduce interest costs.\n\nA euro cash pooling agreement (zero balancing) has been in place between United Internet AG and certain subsidiaries since July 2012. Under the agreement, credit and debit balances of the participating Group subsidiaries are pooled and netted via several cascades in a central bank account of United Internet AG and available each banking day.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, the Group's bank liabilities amounted to € 2,464.3 million (prior year: € 2,155.5 million) and mainly comprise promissory note loans, syndicated loans, and bilateral credit agreements / credit facilities.\n\n## **Promissory note loans**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, United Internet AG successfully placed a promissory note loan (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") – as in the years 2017 and 2021 – with an amount of € 300 million. The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. There are no covenants attached to the new promissory note loan.\n\nMoreover, two promissory note loan tranches totaling € 238.0 million were redeemed on schedule in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, total liabilities from the promissory note loans 2017, 2021, and 2023 with maximum terms until May 2030 therefore amounted to € 1,162.0 million (prior year: € 1,100.0 million).\n\n## **Partial repayment of the shareholder loan by IONOS Group SE**\n\nIn December 2023, IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity.\n\nFollowing the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million and is subordinated. The shareholder loan continues to have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.75%, a term until December 15, 2026, and is to be gradually repaid before this date.\n\n## **Syndicated loan facilities & syndicated loans**\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a banking syndicate granted United Internet AG a revolving syndicated loan facility totaling € 810 million until January 2025. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made use of a \n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontractually agreed prolongation option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated loan facility for the period from January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690 million was agreed for this prolongation period.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, € 150 million of the revolving syndicated loan facility had been drawn (prior year: € 550 million). As a result, funds of € 660 million (prior year: € 260 million) were still available to be drawn from the credit facility as at the balance sheet date.\n\n## **Bilateral credit agreements / bilateral credit facilities**\n\nThe Company also has bilateral credit agreements with several banks totaling € 50 million (prior year: € 200 million). The term expires at the latest on August 12, 2024. As of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, these bilateral credit agreements were used in full (as in the previous year).\n\nIn addition, various bilateral credit facilities amounting to € 475 million (prior year: € 400 million) are available to the Company. These have been granted in part until further notice and in part have terms until March 31, 2025. Drawings of € 295 million (prior year: € 300 million) had been made from these credit facilities as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nUnited Internet therefore had free credit lines from syndicated loan facilities and bilateral credit agreements totaling € 840 million (prior year: € 360 million) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned credit lines, the Group has guaranty credit facilities of € 105.0 million (prior year: € 105.0 million) as at the end of the reporting period, which in some cases can also be used by other Group companies. The guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees.\n\nFurther disclosures on the various financial instruments, drawings, interest rates, and maturities are provided under note 31 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there are purchase obligations for property, plant and equipment (especially for network infrastructure) totaling € 591.4 million (prior year: € 370.8 million). In addition, there are purchase commitments for intangible assets (especially software) totaling € 68.0 million (prior year: € 143.9 million).\n\nFor further details on significant investment obligations, please refer to notes 26 and 27 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.3 Position of the Group\n\nThere were no significant acquisition or divestment effects on consolidated and segment sales and EBITDA in the fiscal year 2023. There were also only minor negative currency effects at Group and segment level (mainly Business Applications segment) amounting to € 9.6 million for sales and € 2.5 million for EBITDA. The same applies to the Group's asset position, for which there were no significant effects from currency fluctuations.\n\n# Group's earnings position\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the total number of fee-based customer contracts in the United Internet Group was raised by a total of 1.03 million contracts, from 27.46 million to 28.49 million contracts.\n\nConsolidated sales increased by 5.0% in the fiscal year 2023, from € 5,915.1 million in the previous year to € 6,213.2 million. Sales outside Germany improved by 5.0% from € 625.5 million to € 656.9 million (despite negative currency effects of € 9.6 million).\n\nThe cost of sales increased from € 3,906.3 million to € 4,145.1 million in the reporting period. Consequently, the cost of sales ratio rose from 66.0% (of sales) in the previous year to 66.7% (of sales) in 2023. This was due in part to a strong year-on-year increase in low-margin hardware sales in the Consumer Access segment. As a result, the gross margin fell from 34.0% to 33.3% and consequently the growth in gross profit of 3.0% from € 2,008.7 million to € 2,068.1 million fell short of sales growth (5.0%).\n\nThe rise in sales and marketing expenses was slightly below that of sales, from € 907.2 million (15.3% of sales) in the previous year to € 943.2 million (15.2% of sales), while the increase in administrative expenses from € 248.5 million (4.2% of sales) to € 275.9 million (4.4% of sales) was slightly in excess of sales growth.\n\nThis disproportionately strong rise in some of the above mentioned cost items results in part from increased expenditure for the rollout of 1&1's mobile communications network, higher depreciation and amortization due to investments in the expansion of the fiber-optic network and mobile network, and strong increases in personnel expenses following an expansion of headcount as well as significant salary adjustments to keep pace with high inflation.\n\n| in € million                  | 2019    | 2020    | 2021       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of sales                 | 3,427.0 | 3,769.3 | 3,684.9(1) | 3,906.3 | 4,145.1 |\n| Cost of sales ratio           | 66.0%   | 70.2%   | 65.3%      | 66.0%   | 66.7%   |\n| Gross margin                  | 34.0%   | 29.8%   | 34.7%      | 34.0%   | 33.3%   |\n| Selling expenses              | 741.8   | 767.9   | 835.7      | 907.2   | 943.2   |\n| Selling expenses ratio        | 14.3%   | 14.3%   | 14.8%      | 15.3%   | 15.2%   |\n| Administrative expenses       | 205.9   | 206.0   | 243.0      | 248.5   | 275.9   |\n| Administrative expenses ratio | 4.0%    | 3.8%    | 4.3%       | 4.2%    | 4.4%    |\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: Development of key cost items**\n\n(1) Including the non-period positive effect on earnings attributable to the second half of 2020 (EBITDA and EBIT effect: € +39.4 million)\n\nOther operating expenses decreased from € 46.5 million in the previous year to € 33.3 million in 2023 and other operating income from € 92.3 million to € 60.6 million. Due to an increase in payment defaults, impairment losses on receivables and contract assets rose from € 117.4 million in the previous year to € 122.3 million in 2023.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nKey earnings figures were influenced by two special items in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022:\n\n- The special item \"IPO costs IONOS\" results from one-off costs in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE, as well as – with an opposing effect in 2023 – the partial assumption of costs by IONOS co-owner Warburg Pincus, and had an overall negative impact on EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n- The special item \"non-cash valuation effect from derivatives\" results from quarterly revaluations of derivatives and had a negative impact on EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n\n**Reconciliation of EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS with figures adjusted for special items (operating)** \n\n|                                                                                  | Fiscal year | Fiscal year |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| in € million; EPS in €                                                           | 2023        | 2022        |\n| EBITDA                                                                           | 1,292.1     | 1,262.5     |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBITDA adjusted for special items (operating)                                    | 1,300.1     | 1,271.8     |\n| EBIT                                                                             | 754.0       | 781.4       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBIT adjusted for special items (operating)                                      | 762.0       | 790.7       |\n| EBT                                                                              | 597.6       | 711.5       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBT adjusted for special items (operating)                                       | 605.6       | 720.8       |\n| Net income                                                                       | 362.2       | 464.7       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.7         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 4.4         | 0.4         |\n| Net income adjusted for special items (operating)                                | 368.3       | 473.8       |\n| Net income \"Shareholders United Internet\"                                        | 232.7       | 367.2       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 5.9         | 6.5         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 4.4         | 0.4         |\n| Net income \"Shareholders United Internet\" adjusted for special items (operating) | 243.0       | 374.1       |\n| EPS                                                                              | 1.35        | 1.97        |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 0.03        | 0.03        |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 0.03        | 0.00        |\n| EPS adjusted for special items (operating)                                       | 1.41        | 2.00        |\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdjusted for the above mentioned special items, the key performance measures EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS for the fiscal year 2023 developed as follows:\n\nConsolidated operating EBITDA rose by € 28.2 million (2.2%), from € 1,271.8 million in the previous year to € 1,300.1 million. This at first glance only moderate EBITDA growth was due in particular to planned increased costs for the construction of 1&1's mobile communications network. In 2023, these rose to € -132.4 million, after € -52.4 million in the previous year.\n\nConsolidated operating EBIT was additionally burdened by increased depreciation, especially for investments in the fiber-optic network and the mobile network (€ -71.3 million). As a result, it fell by € -28.7 million (-3.6%) from € 790.7 million to € 762.0 million. Since the beginning of 2024, the increase in depreciation on investments – mainly due to the operational launch of 1&1's mobile network – is being offset by steadily increasing cost savings on advance mobile services.\n\nThere was a corresponding fall in the operating EBITDA margin and the operating EBIT margin from 21.5% to 20.9% and from 13.4% to 12.3%, respectively.\n\nThe number of Group employees rose by 4.7% to 10,962 in 2023 (prior year: 10,474).\n\nImage /page/49/Figure/15 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing Sales, EBITDA, and EBIT.

Likewise, operating consolidated net income and operating consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of United Internet AG fell from € 473.8 million to € 368.3 million and from € 374.1 million to € 243.0 million, respectively. In addition to the lower EBIT result (€ -28.7 million), this decline in the key operating figures was mainly due to a year-on-year decrease in the result from associated companies (€ -26.4 million) and the financial result (€ -60.0 million). The latter was impacted by the increase in interest rates.\n\nWithout consideration of the valuation effects from derivatives and the IONOS IPO costs (total EPS effect: € -0.06; prior year: € -0.03), operating EPS in the fiscal year 2023 declined from € 2.00 in the prior-year period to € 1.41. In addition to the decrease in EBIT (EPS effect: € -0.13), this was also due to a lower result from associated companies (EPS effect: € -0.16), and the lower financial result (EPS effect: € -0.30).\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group's financial position\n\nDespite the decline in net income, operative cash flow rose slightly from € 1,010.7 million(1) in the previous year to € 1,018.0 million in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nCash flow from operating activities increased to € 828.5 million (prior year: € 616.4 million(1) – incl. phasing effects of € -97.2 million from Q4 2021). The increase mainly results from the change in trade accounts payable.\n\nCash flow from investing activities in the reporting period led to a net outflow of € -798.2 million (prior year: € -701.6 million(1)). This resulted mainly from capital expenditures of € -797.9 million (prior year: € -681.4 million).\n\nUnited Internet's free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus payments from disposals of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Free cash flow in the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 36.4 million (prior year: € -60.5 million(1) – incl. phasing effects). After deducting the cash flow item \"Redemption of lease liabilities\" – disclosed in cash flow from financing activities since the initial application of the accounting standard IFRS 16 – free cash flow (after leasing) amounted to € -85.0 million (prior year: € -173.2 million(1)).\n\nCash flow from financing activities in the fiscal year 2023 was dominated by the purchase of treasury shares (€ -291.9 million; prior year: € 0), the net assumption of loans (€ +305.2 million; prior year: € +328.6 million(1)), payments for interest (€ -91.0 million; prior year: € -30,2 million(1)), the redemption of lease liabilities (€ -121.3 million; prior year: € -112.6 million), dividend payments (€ -86.4 million; prior year: € -93.4 million), and payments received from minority shareholders (€ 305.0 million; prior year: € -15.2 million disbursement) in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE as well as from purchase price payments made by Warburg Pincus.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 27.7 million – compared to € 40.5 million on the same date last year.\n\n| in € million                             | 2023     | 2022(1)   | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|---------|\n| Operative cash flow                      | 1,018.0  | 1,010.7   | + 7.3   |\n| Cash flow from operating activities      | 828.5    | 616.4     | + 212.1 |\n| Cash flow from investing activities      | -798.2   | -701.6    | - 96.6  |\n| Free cash flow(2)                        | -85.0(3) | -173.2(4) | + 88.2  |\n| Cash flow from financing activities      | -43.6    | 14.2      | - 57.8  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents on December 31 | 27.7     | 40.5      | - 12.8  |\n\n#### **Development of key cash flow figures**\n\n(1) With regard to the changes in the presentation of the cash flow statement, reference is made to the explanations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 46\n\n(2) Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus payments from disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\n(2) 2023 including the repayment portion of lease liabilities (€121.3 million), which have been reported under cash flow from financing activities since the fiscal year 2019 (IFRS 16)\n\n(4) 2022 including the repayment portion of lease liabilities (€112.6 million), which have been reported under cash flow from financing activities since the fiscal year 2019 (IFRS 16)\n\nFor further details on guarantees, leases, and other financial obligations, please refer to chapter 2.2 \"Business development\", \"Liquidity and finance\", as well as note 45 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group's asset position\n\nThe balance sheet total increased from € 10.358 billion as of December 31, 2022 to € 11.246 billion on December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Development of current assets**\n\n| in € million               | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change  |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents  | 27.7          | 40.5          | - 12.8  |\n| Trade accounts receivable  | 508.9         | 418.8         | + 90.1  |\n| Contract assets            | 676.1         | 648.4         | + 27.7  |\n| Inventories                | 178.1         | 120.6         | + 57.5  |\n| Prepaid expenses           | 303.8         | 282.1         | + 21.7  |\n| Other financial assets     | 96.9          | 106.6         | - 9.7   |\n| Income tax claims          | 34.8          | 34.7          | + 0.0   |\n| Other non-financial assets | 13.8          | 19.7          | - 5.9   |\n| Total current assets       | 1,840.1       | 1,671.4       | + 168.7 |\n\nCurrent assets rose from € 1,671.4 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 1,840.1 million on December 31, 2023. However, cash and cash equivalents disclosed under current assets decreased from € 40.5 million to € 27.7 million due to closing-date effects. Likewise, trade accounts receivable fell from € 418.8 million to € 508.9 million due to closing-date effects. As a result of customer growth, the item current contract assets rose from € 648.4 million to € 676.1 million and includes current claims against customers due to accelerated revenue recognition from the application of IFRS 15. In order to avoid supply bottlenecks, inventories were raised from € 120.6 million to € 178.1 million. Due to prepayments made to advance service providers and closing-date effects, current prepaid expenses increased from € 282.1 million to € 303.8 million and mainly comprise the short-term portion of expenses relating to contract acquisition and contract fulfillment according to IFRS 15.

Due in particular to the deterioration in the pro rata result of investments (mainly Kublai / Tele Columbus), shares in associated companies fell from € 429.3 million to € 373.2 million. Capital expenditures in the reporting period (especially for the 5G network rollout and expansion of the fiber-optic network in the Consumer Access and Business Access segments) led to a strong increase in property, plant and equipment from € 1,851.0 million to € 2,405.3 million, while intangible assets declined from € 2,029.3 million to € 2,001.6 million mainly as a result of amortization. Due to\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nprepayments made to advance service providers and closing-date effects, non-current prepaid expenses rose strongly from € 429.0 million to € 679.8 million.

Due to closing-date effects, current trade accounts payable increased from € 561.5 million to € 699.2 million. There was a decrease in current liabilities due to banks from € 656.7 million to € 582.4 million as a result of the reduction of short-term liabilities. Current other nonfinancial liabilities increased from € 69.0 million to € 129.6 million and mainly include liabilities due to tax authorities as of the respective balance sheet date. The items income tax liabilities and current contract liabilities (which mainly include payments received from customer contracts for which the performance has not yet been completely rendered), as well as current other accrued liabilities, and current other financial liabilities were all virtually unchanged.\n\n#### **Development of non-current liabilities**\n\n| in € million                  | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change  |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n| Liabilities due to banks      | 1,881.9       | 1,498.8       | + 383.0 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities      | 293.0         | 309.7         | - 16.7  |\n| Trade accounts payable        | 3.4           | 4.3           | - 0.9   |\n| Contract liabilities          | 32.7          | 31.3          | + 1.4   |\n| Other accrued liabilities     | 68.7          | 67.1          | + 1.6   |\n| Other financial liabilities   | 1,388.3       | 1,313.3       | + 75.0  |\n| Total non-current liabilities | 3,667.9       | 3,224.5       | + 443.4 |\n\nNon-current liabilities increased from € 3,224.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 3,667.9 million on December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to non-current liabilities due to banks, which rose from € 1,498.8 million to € 1,881.9 million, largely as a result of the assumption of a promissory note loan totaling € 300 million. As a result of higher leasing additions (IFRS 16), other financial liabilities rose from € 1,313.3 million to € 1,388.3 million.

The Group's accumulated profit – comprising the past profits of the consolidated companies, insofar as they were not distributed – rose from € 2,835.8 million to € 2,980.5 million in the fiscal year 2023. At the same time, capital reserves rose from € 1,966.2 million to € 2,197.7 million due to the sale of shares during the IONOS IPO with an opposing effect from the cancellation of treasury shares. As a result of the share buyback explained below, there was an increase in the value of treasury shares from € -231.5 million to € -459.8 million. Treasury shares are deducted from equity capital. The consolidated equity ratio fell slightly from 51.2% to 49.4%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, United Internet AG held a total of 7,284,109 treasury shares, corresponding to approx. 3.75% of the capital stock at the time of 194,000,000 shares. On February 14, 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and on the basis of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 regarding the acquisition and use of treasury shares, to initially cancel two million treasury shares and to reduce the capital stock of United Internet AG from € 194 million to € 192 million. The number of shares issued decreased accordingly from 194 million shares to 192 million shares. The pro-rata amount of capital stock per issued share remained unchanged at € 1. The cancellation of the treasury shares serves to increase the proportionate participation of United Internet shareholders. Following the cancellation of the aforementioned two million shares, United Internet AG initially held 5,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 2.75% of the Company's current capital stock.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG also decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9 million shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9 million. With the public share buyback offer, United Internet AG made use of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company on May 20, 2020, under which up to 10% of the Company's capital stock could be bought back by August 31, 2023. The shares bought back may be used for all of the purposes permitted under the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020. The shares may also be canceled.\n\nIn the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period. The offer was based on the buyback of up to 13.9 million shares in total. As the total number of shares for which the offer was accepted exceeded this maximum amount, the declarations of acceptance were considered on a pro rata basis, i.e., corresponding to the ratio of the maximum number of United Internet shares to be purchased pursuant to this offer, i.e., 13.9 \n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion United Internet shares, to the aggregate number of United Internet shares tendered by United Internet shareholders for buyback.\n\nUpon completion of the above mentioned capital reduction by means of canceling two million treasury shares, and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet holds 19,183,705 treasury shares as of December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares. In view of the offer price of € 21.00 per United Internet share, the purchase price for the buyback of 13,899,596 shares in total amounted to € 291.9 million and thus corresponded approximately to the sales proceeds of United Internet from the IONOS IPO.\n\nDue mainly to investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (€ -797.9 million, of which € -41.9 million for the acquisition of the BT city networks), as well as the contingent payment for advance services to Deutsche Telekom (€ -276.5 million), and the dividend payment (€ -86.4 million), net bank liabilities (i.e., the balance of bank liabilities and cash and cash equivalents) increased from € 2,115.0 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 2,436.6 million on December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, United Internet AG successfully placed a promissory note loan totaling € 300 million. The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. Moreover, in December 2023, the subsidiary IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. Following the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of relative indebtedness**\n\n|                                     | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|                                     | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     | 2022     | 2023     |\n| Net bank liabilities(1) /<br>EBITDA | 1.28     | 1.27     | 1.31     | 1.68     | 1.89     |\n\n(1) Net bank liabilities = balance of bank liabilities and cash and cash equivalents\n\nFurther details on the objectives and methods of the Group's financial risk management are provided under note 43 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of key balance sheet items**\n\n| in € million                   | Dec. 31,<br>2019 | Dec. 31,<br>2020 | Dec. 31,<br>2021 | Dec. 31,<br>2022 | Dec. 31,<br>2023 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Total assets                   | 9,128.8          | 9,230.8          | 9,669.1          | 10,358.5         | 11,245.6         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents      | 117.6            | 131.3            | 110.1            | 40.5             | 27.7             |\n| Shares in associated companies | 196.0            | 89.6(1)          | 431.6(1)         | 429.3            | 373.2            |\n| Other financial assets         | 90.4             | 9.9(2)           | 11.6             | 10.7             | 8.3              |\n| Property, plant and equipment  | 1,160.6          | 1,271.6          | 1,379.6          | 1,851.0          | 2,405.3          |\n| Intangible assets              | 2,167.4          | 2,197.8          | 2,059.4          | 2,029.3          | 2,001.6          |\n| Goodwill                       | 3,616.5          | 3,609.4          | 3,627.8          | 3,623.4          | 3,628.8          |\n| Liabilities due to banks       | 1,738.4          | 1,466.1          | 1,822.7          | 2,155.5          | 2,464.3          |\n| Capital stock                  | 205.0            | 194.0(3)         | 194.0            | 194.0            | 192.0(3)         |\n| Equity                         | 4,614.7          | 4,911.2          | 4,923.2          | 5,298.4          | 5,555.1          |\n| Equity ratio                   | 50.6%            | 53.2%            | 50.9%            | 51.2%            | 49.4%            |\n\n(1) Decrease due to reclassification Tele Columbus (2020); increase due to stake in Kublai (2021)\n\n(2) Decrease due to sale of Afilias shares (2020)\n\n(3) Decrease due to withdrawal of treasury shares (2020 and 2023)\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's business situation\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for 2023 slightly during the course of the year. In its latest economic outlook, the IMF reported growth of 3.1% for the global economy in 2023, based on preliminary calculations. Growth was thus below the prior-year level (3.5%) but at the same time 0.2 percentage points above the IMF's original outlook in January 2023 (2.9%).\n\nThe IMF's calculations for Germany are in line with the preliminary figures of the country's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), which – at its \"GDP 2023\" press conference on January 15, 2024 – announced a decline in (price-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) of -0.3% for 2023. This is 2.1 percentage points less than in 2022 (1.8%). According to the Federal Statistical Office, this was due to further inflation-related high prices throughout the economy, unfavorable borrowing conditions caused by rising interest rates and an overall decline in both domestic and foreign demand.\n\nThanks to its stable and largely non-cyclical business model, United Internet made good progress again in the fiscal year 2023 – despite the aforementioned adverse macroeconomic conditions. The Company was able to achieve the sales and earnings targets it set itself, continuing its successful development with an increase in fee-based customer contracts of over 1 million to 28.49 million and sales growth of 5.0% to € 6.213 billion. At the same time, there was a further improvement in operating EBITDA – despite heavy investment in future topics – with an increase of 2.2% to around € 1.300 billion. This at first glance only moderate EBITDA growth was due in particular to planned increased costs for the construction of 1&1's mobile communications network. These rose to € -132.4 million, compared to € - 52.4 million in the previous year – a year-on-year increase of € -80.0 million.\n\nThe positive performance once again highlights the benefits of United Internet's business model based predominantly on electronic subscriptions with fixed monthly payments. This ensures stable and predictable revenues and cash flows, offers protection against cyclical influences and provides the financial scope to win new customers, expand existing customer relationships, and grasp opportunities in new business fields and new markets – organically or via investments and acquisitions.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company once again invested heavily in gaining and expanding customer relationships, as well as in developing new products – thus laying the basis for future growth.\n\nAs of the reporting date for the Annual Financial Statements 2023, and at the time of preparing this Management Report, the Management Board believes that the United Internet Group as a whole is well placed for its further development. It regards the financial position and performance – subject to possible special items – as positive and is optimistic about the Group's future prospects.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.4 Position of the Company\n\n# Earnings of United Internet AG\n\nAs a pure holding company, the earnings position of United Internet AG is usually dominated by its investment and financial result. In the fiscal year 2023, sales of the parent company amounted to € 1.1 million (prior year: € 0.7 million) and result mainly from services rendered to the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nOther operating income amounted to € 221.4 million (prior year: € 4.2 million). In addition to minimal income from internal charges to Group companies and the release of accruals, this mainly resulted from the disposal of financial investments of € 219.1 million from the sale of shares in Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE in the course of the IONOS IPO.\n\nOther operating expenses amounted to € 31.3 million (prior year: € 20.2 million) and mainly include expenses relating to internal charges for services rendered to Group companies, legal, auditing, and consulting fees, as well as non-period expenses.\n\nIncome from profit transfer agreements of € 101.9 million (prior year: € 90.6 million) resulted from profit transfers of 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE amounting to € 98.9 million (prior year: € 87.1 million), United Internet Corporate Services GmbH amounting to € 2.8 million (prior year: € 3.4 million), and United Internet Service SE amounting to € 0.1 million (prior year: € 0.1 million).\n\nIncome from investments amounted to € 0 (prior year: € 13.8 million). In the previous year, this item mainly comprised the dividends of 1&1 AG for 2021 and – due to the requirement at the time for sameperiod profit recognition – for 2022.\n\nExpenses for loss assumptions of € 19.2 million (prior year: € 6.2 million) related to the compensation expense of United Internet Investments Holding SE, United Internet Management Holding SE, and United Internet Corporate Holding SE.\n\nIncluding the special items from the above mentioned sale of IONOS shares, the parent company's result before taxes amounted to € 318.1 million (prior year: € 170.4 million).\n\nIncome taxes amounted to € 44.1 million (prior year: € 49.7 million).\n\nNet income in the separate financial statements of United Internet AG for the fiscal year 2023 – including special items (IONOS IPO) – amounted to € 274.0 million (prior year: € 120.7 million).\n\n# Assets and financial position of United Internet AG\n\nThe parent company's balance sheet total decreased from € 6,563.9 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 5,865.6 million on December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-current assets of the parent company amounting to € 4,832.2 million (prior year: € 5,816.9 million) were dominated by financial assets. Due to the sale of IONOS shares, shares in affiliated companies fell to € 4,132.2 million (prior year: € 4,221.9 million). Loans to affiliated companies declined to € 700.0 million (prior year: € 1,595.0 million), due in particular to the partial refinancing of the existing shareholder loan between United Internet AG and IONOS by means of a syndicated loan amounting to € 800 million. After consideration of further repayments during the fiscal year 2023 totaling € 95 million, the outstanding loan as at December 31, 2023 amounted to € 350 million.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent assets of the parent company amounting to € 1,033.4 million (prior year: € 746.9 million) comprise receivables due from affiliated companies and other assets. The receivables due from affiliated companies increased to € 1,010.6 million (prior year: € 724.8 million). Contrary to the previous year (comparable amount: € 618.0 million), these receivables are disclosed net in the balance sheet as of the fiscal year 2023. They mainly comprise receivables from sales tax grouping as part of the cash management system, as well as from profit transfer agreements. The rise in receivables due from affiliated companies is mainly the result of receivables due from the subsidiary 1&1 Versatel GmbH from cash management and reflects the company's increased investments in the fiber-optic network. Other assets amounting to € 22.7 million (prior year: € 19.3 million) consist mainly of receivables due from the tax office relating to audits of previous years.\n\nShareholders' equity of the parent company amounted to € 3,517.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 3,621.7 million). The decrease in equity during the reporting period is mainly due to the dividend payout of € 86.4 million and the purchase of treasury shares amounting to € 291.9 million, which are deducted from equity. There was an opposing effect from net income of € 274.0 million. The equity ratio rose from 55.2% in the previous year to 60.0% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe parent company's accruals of € 7.7 million (prior year: € 8.1 million) mainly comprise accrued taxes amounting to € 5.0 million (prior year: € 3.8 million), as well as other accrued liabilities for employee stock ownership plans, legal, auditing and consulting fees, bonuses, and other items totaling € 2.6 million (prior year: € 4.3 million).\n\nThe liabilities of the parent company are shaped in particular by liabilities due to banks and to affiliated companies. In the fiscal year 2023, liabilities to banks decreased to € 1,668.3 million (prior year: € 2,157.2 million). Bank liabilities mainly comprise three promissory note loans totaling € 1,162 million, syndicated loans totaling € 150 million, drawings from bilateral credit agreements of € 50 million, drawings from bilateral credit facilities of € 295 million, and interest of € 11.4 million. Liabilities to affiliated companies fell to € 564.0 million (prior year: € 757.6 million). As of the fiscal year 2023, these liabilities are disclosed net in the balance sheet. They mainly comprise liabilities from balances within the United Internet Group's cash pooling system, from sales tax grouping, and from profit and loss transfer agreements. Other liabilities of € 89.8 million (prior year: € 3.4 million) are mainly sales tax liabilities.\n\nCash flow of the parent company's financial statements is dominated by cash flows from the profit transfer agreements, as well as the dividends of investments.\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the current business situation of the parent company\n\nDue to its role as the Group's holding company, the economic position of United Internet AG at parent company level is mainly influenced by its investment and financial result. The above statements on the Group's economic position therefore also apply qualitatively for United Internet AG itself.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.5 Corporate Responsibility\n\nUnited Internet AG's Management Board and Supervisory Board consider it their responsibility to ensure the Company's continued existence and create sustainable value through responsible corporate management that takes a long-term perspective. For United Internet, running a business involves more than pursuing economic goals – it also has an obligation to society, the environment, employees, and other stakeholders.\n\nUnited Internet AG fulfills its disclosure obligations pursuant to the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – CSR-RUG) (sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with section 289c of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB)) and publishes a separate non-financial Group report as part of a separate sustainability report. In this Sustainability Report, the Company also complies with its reporting obligation under the EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and discloses its proportion of environmentally sustainable business activities accordingly.\n\nThe Company's Sustainability Report 2023 will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.unitedinternet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html) and thus fulfills the disclosure requirements of the CSR-RUG and the transparency requirements of stakeholders.\n\nThe separate non-financial Group report contains the statutory disclosures for the aspects \"environmental matters\" (chapter: Environmental Responsibility), \"employee-related matters\" and \"social matters\" (chapter: Social Responsibility), and \"respect for human rights\" and \"anti-corruption and bribery matters\" (chapter: Corporate Responsibility). This list of the minimum aspects required by the CSR-RUG has been supplemented by the chapter \"Digital Responsibility\", which is a material aspect for United Internet and also particularly relevant for the sector.\n\nIn addition to the CSR-RUG, reporting is based on the internationally recognized Sustainability Reporting Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) with the option: \"With reference to the GRI Standards\". Both the CSR-RUG and the GRI Standards expect information to be presented on how the material topics and their impacts are managed, and in particular the associated goals and measures, and the procedures used for risk identification and mitigation. In addition, the European Commission's Guidelines on non-financial reporting are applied, which build on Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups – the European Directive underlying the CSR-RUG.\n\nWhen defining the content, the materiality principle was applied. In 2022, a double materiality analysis was carried out to determine the material topics. Both the business relevance for United Internet and the potential and specific impact of the Company's activities on the environment and society were taken into account.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, the main focus was on preparing for the first CSRD reporting for the fiscal year 2024. A Group-wide project was driven forward in order to meet the reporting requirements of the new EU reporting obligation. The materiality matrix from the fiscal year 2023 formed the basis for the development of the future reporting strategy. A reconciliation to the CSRD requirements and a comprehensive gap analysis of the future quantitative and qualitative reporting obligations were conducted. The necessary transformation of the reporting system was initiated. As part of an evaluation project, the necessary processes, IT concepts and software solutions were reviewed in order to facilitate future data collection for all parties involved.\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board is responsible for examining the content of sustainability reporting. The Supervisory Board is supported in this by a \"limited assurance\" review of the separate non-financial Group report by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 3. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nThere were no significant events subsequent to the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023 which had a material effect on the financial position and performance or the accounting and reporting of the parent company or the Group.\n\nInformation on the economic position of the Group and Company at the time of preparing this Management Report are provided in chapter 4.3 \"Forecast report\".\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4. RISK, OPPORTUNITY AND FORECAST REPORT\n\nThe risk and opportunity policy of the United Internet Group is based on the objective of maintaining and sustainably enhancing the Company's values by utilizing opportunities while at the same time recognizing and managing risks from an early stage in their development. A risk and opportunity management system which is \"lived\" ensures that the United Internet Group (\"United Internet\") can exercise its business activities in a controlled company environment. The risk and opportunity management system regulates the responsible handling of those uncertainties which are always involved with economic activity.\n\n# 4.1 Risk report\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe concept, organization, and task of United Internet's risk management system are defined by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG, and documented in a risk management strategy and risk management manual which is valid for and available to all members of the Group. These requirements are regularly adapted to changing legal conditions and continuously developed. Corporate Risk Management coordinates the implementation and ongoing development of the risk management system and is responsible for the centrally managed risk management process on behalf of the Management Board. The risk management system covers only the Group's risks, while responsibility for the early and ongoing identification, evaluation, and management of opportunities lies directly with the Group Management Board and the operating management levels of the respective segments.\n\nCorporate Risk Management is supported by the risk management teams of the respective segments (Company Risk Management). In order to support Company Risk Management, additional local risk managers have been installed in business fields of particular importance for the Company's business success (such as the areas \"Technology & Development\"). In order to facilitate the Group-wide exchange and comparison of risk information, regular Risk Manager Meetings are held between the various risk managers and also with the Company-wide, cross-functional managers.\n\nThe Corporate Audit department regularly examines the functioning and efficiency of the risk management system. As part of his statutory auditing obligations for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, the external auditor also examines whether the risk early recognition system is generally suitable for the early identification of risks and developments which might endanger the Company so that suitable countermeasures can be swiftly introduced. The system complies with statutory requirements regarding risk early recognition systems, as well as with the version of the German Corporate Governance Code valid at the time of the last Declaration of Conformity of United Internet AG. Its design is based on the specifications of the ISO standard 31000:2018. In accordance with the regulations of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board also examines the efficacy of the risk management system.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Methods and objectives of risk management\n\nThe risk management system comprises those measures which enable United Internet to identify, classify in terms of money and scenario, steer, and monitor from an early stage all possible risks for the attainment of its corporate objectives with the aid of assessments and early warning systems. The aim of the Group-wide and IT-supported risk management system is to provide maximum transparency for management regarding the actual risk situation, its changes, and the available options for action so that a conscious decision can be taken to accept or avoid such risks. Risks endangering the Company must be avoided as a matter of principle. There is always an established indirect connection to central Group-wide risk management via the regular reporting channels throughout the Group and a direct connection for all major divisions. This ensures the completeness of registered risks in the risk management system.\n\nThe current status of the main risks is communicated to the Management Board and Supervisory Board four times per year.\n\nIdentified significant risks with an immediate impact and changes in the risk situation trigger an ad-hoc reporting obligation. The respective risk is then communicated immediately to the CFO of United Internet AG, who in turn reports it to the Supervisory Board where necessary. In this way, significant risks can be addressed as quickly as possible.\n\nRisks are assessed with their net impact, i.e., effects from mitigating measures are only considered in the risk assessment after their implementation.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Risks for the United Internet Group\n\nThe assessment of the overall risk situation is the result of a consolidated examination of all known material risks. Of the total risks identified for the Group, the following sections describe the main risk categories from the Company's point of view.\n\nThe starting point for assessing the materiality of risks is provided by the characteristics \"probability of occurrence\" and \"potential damage\". The potential damage comprises all negative influences on earnings. Based on the combination of probability of occurrence and potential damage, the risks are assigned as follows to one of three risk categories: \"Significant\", \"Moderate\", and \"Low\" risks.\n\n|                                         |                                                   | Very low<br>(0% - 5%) | Low<br>(> 5% - 20%) | High<br>(> 20% - 50%) | Very high<br>(> 50% - 100%) |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                         | Extremely high<br>(> € 200 million)               |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | Very high<br>(> € 100 million -<br>€ 200 million) |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | High<br>(> € 20 million -<br>€ 100 million)       |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| Potential damage                        | Low<br>(> € 5 million - € 20 million)             |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | Very low<br>(€ 0 - € 5 million)                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| Probability of occurrence               |                                                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| significant risk moderate risk low risk |                                                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n\nSpecific assessments of the Company's Management Board regarding the Group's risk situation, as well as the probability of occurrence, potential damage, and resulting categorization of the risks described below are provided at the end of this Risk Report.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Strategy**\n\n#### **Shareholdings & investments**\n\nThe acquisition and holding of shares in other companies and the making of strategic investments represent a key success factor for United Internet AG. In addition to improved access to existing and new growth markets, as well as to new technologies and know-how, investments also serve to exploit synergy and growth potential. However, these opportunities involve risks. For example, there is a risk that the targeted potential cannot be exploited as forecast or that acquired shareholdings will not develop as expected (non-scheduled write-downs/impairments, disposal losses, absence of dividend, or reduction of hidden reserves).\n\nAll investments are therefore subject to a continuous monitoring process by the Investment Management and are supported promptly if required. This risk is largely without relevance for EBITDA as, in the event of an incident, predominantly non-cash-effective impairments are incurred. The value of investments is continuously monitored by management and the Controlling division.\n\n#### **Business development & innovations**\n\nA further important success factor for United Internet is the development of new and constantly improved products and services in order to enhance sales and earnings, attract new customers, and expand existing customer relationships. There is always a risk, however, that new developments might be launched too late on the market or not be accepted by the target group as expected.\n\nUnited Internet counters such risks by constantly and closely observing market, product, and competition trends, as well as by undertaking product development which constantly responds to customer feedback.\n\nAs part of its efforts to diversify the business model or expand its value chain, United Internet occasionally enters new markets, or upstream and downstream markets. For example, the management board of 1&1 AG, a subsidiary of United Internet AG, decided with the approval of its supervisory board to establish and operate a high-performance 5G mobile network on the basis of the spectrum in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands it acquired in 2019. By establishing and operating its own network, the Company plans to further expand its value added in mobile communications, to tap new business fields, and to reduce its dependence on procuring wholesale services from other network operators.\n\n1&1 has enlisted in particular the services of the Japanese technology group and acclaimed OpenRAN expert Rakuten as general contractor for the rollout of its mobile communications network. Together with Rakuten, 1&1 is building a fully virtualized mobile network based on the innovative OpenRAN technology. The use of OpenRAN technology will reduce 1&1's dependence on network equipment suppliers. There are risks that the network rollout will not progress at the expected speed. Supply problems for the necessary hardware or delays in the search for sites are potential risks.\n\nIn selecting partners for the rollout of its network, 1&1 placed great importance on minimizing such risks. The general contractor and partner for active network technology Rakuten, for example, was the world's first and only network equipment supplier to establish a mobile communications network on the basis of the new OpenRAN technology in Japan. As a result, 1&1 can benefit from the experience and learning curve Rakuten gained during this time. The partners for passive technology are established and leading companies in Europe for radio tower infrastructure, enabling 1&1 to benefit from their existing infrastructure.\n\nNevertheless, initial delays in the construction of antenna locations already occurred in 2022 and 2023. These delays were due to supply problems of advance service providers. Delays in network rollout may\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nmean that more advance services have to be procured externally than planned in the period up to completion of the mobile network rollout, which would have a negative impact on value added.\n\nIn order to counter this risk appropriately, 1&1 entered into further partnerships for the acquisition of antenna locations and for its own construction of antenna locations, thus reducing the risk position.\n\n#### **Cooperation & outsourcing**\n\nSome operating divisions of United Internet work together with specialized cooperation and outsourcing partners in certain areas of the Company. The focus here is on objectives such as focusing on the actual core business, reducing costs, or leveraging the expertise of partners. These opportunities also involve risks in the form of dependencies on external service providers, as well as contractual and default risks.\n\nIn order to reduce these risks, detailed market analyses and due diligence reviews are carried out before major contracts are concluded with external service providers, and close and cooperative relationships are maintained with the cooperation and outsourcing partners after the contracts have been concluded.\n\n#### **Organizational structure & decision-making**\n\nThe choice of the appropriate organizational structure is essential for the efficiency and success of the Company. In addition to the organizational structure, business success depends to a large extent on making the right decisions. The basis for such decisions can be negatively influenced by various factors, such as limited flexibility offered by existing business processes and structures, or misunderstandings caused by ambiguities in the definition of key figures. If efficiency is jeopardized by one or several factors, this represents a strategic risk for United Internet which should be avoided wherever it makes economic sense.\n\nDue to the high degree of agility within the organization, United Internet considers itself to be generally well positioned in this respect and undertakes a number of measures to standardize and optimize processes, structures, and key figures.\n\nUnited Internet is not aware of any significant risks in this field at present.\n\n#### **Personnel development & retention**\n\nHighly skilled and well trained employees form the basis for the economic success of United Internet. In addition to the successful recruitment of qualified personnel (see also the \"personnel recruitment\" risk), personnel development and the long-term retention of top performers within the Company are strategically important. If the Company fails to develop and retain executives and employees with specialist or technological knowledge, there is the danger that United Internet may not be able to effectively conduct its business and achieve its growth targets. The concentrated accumulation of strategic knowledge and skills (so-called head monopoly) can have a considerable impact on the performance of the Company if the corresponding employee is no longer available.\n\nUnited Internet counteracts this risk by continuously nurturing employee and management skills. For example, it offers targeted measures for professional development, mentoring and coaching programs, as well as special offers for high potentials geared to talent development and retention and leadership skills.\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"HR Strategy and HR Organization\", \"Training and Education\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", as well as \"Occupational Health and Safety\", please refer to the chapter \"United Internet as an Employer\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which \n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nwill be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investorrelations/publications/reports.html).\n\n## **Market**\n\n#### **Sales market and competition**\n\nThe markets in which United Internet operates are characterized by strong and sustained competition. Depending on the strategy of the parties involved in the market, different effects may occur which may lead also involve adjustments to the Company's own business models or pricing policy. The entry of new competitors might also jeopardize market shares, growth targets, or margins. In addition, United Internet itself occasionally enters new, additional markets with large competitors. Such an entrepreneurial decision is always associated with new risks.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to minimize these risks by means of detailed planning based on internal experience and external market studies, as well as by constantly monitoring the market and the competition.\n\n#### **Procurement market**\n\nA gap in the procurement or delivery of resources required for business operations may also lead to bottlenecks or outages at United Internet. This applies both to the purchase of hardware and the purchase of wholesale services. Increases in the price of purchased products and services represent a risk for the targeted margins. Planned positive effects from contractually fixed price adjustment rounds can become a risk for the achievement of the Company's periodic targets due to time delays.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks by cooperating with several long-term service providers and suppliers, contractual obligations, and – where it makes economic sense – by expanding its own value chain. Although significant and unforeseeable developments on the procurement market as a result of events such as the Ukraine war cannot be fully offset, they can be countered by taking preventive measures such as rapidly restocking inventories.\n\n#### **Financial market**\n\nUnited Internet's activities are fundamentally exposed to risks on the financial market. In particular, these include risks from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.\n\n#### **Interest**\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest risks as the major share of its borrowing bears variable interest rates with varying terms. As part of its liquidity planning, the Company constantly monitors the various investment possibilities and debt conditions. Any borrowing requirements are met by using suitable instruments to manage liquidity. Surplus cash is invested on the money market to achieve the best possible return. Due to developments on the global finance markets, i.e., adjustments to central bank interest rates around the world, there was a slight increase in the interest rate risk, but at the same time opportunities from more attractive investment options. Market interest rate changes might have an adverse effect on the interest result and are included in our calculation of sensitive factors affecting earnings. In order to present market risks, United Internet has developed a sensitivity analysis which shows the impact of hypothetical changes to relevant risk variables on pretax earnings. The reporting period effects are illustrated by applying these hypothetical changes in risk variables to the stock of financial instruments as of the balance sheet date. The Company regularly reviews the possibility of interest rate hedging in order to mitigate the negative effects of rising interest rates.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Currency**\n\nThe currency risk predominantly results from operations (if revenue and/or expenses are in a currency other than the Group's functional currency) and its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Personnel recruitment market**\n\nIt is essential for United Internet that human resources are effectively controlled so that the Company can ensure its short- and long-term needs for staff and the requisite expertise. If it is unable to attract managers and employees with specialist and technological knowledge, United Internet would not be able to effectively conduct its business and achieve its growth targets.\n\nIn recent years, the shortage of skilled workers has become an increasingly important issue. As an attractive employer, however, United Internet believes it is well placed to hire highly skilled specialists and managers with the potential to drive its business success in the future. This was confirmed in the past years by the Top Employers Institute, which awarded United Internet the accolade \"Top Employer 2023\".\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"HR Strategy and HR Organization\", \"Training and Education\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", as well as \"Occupational Health and Safety\", please refer to the chapter \"United Internet as an Employer\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investorrelations/publications/reports.html).\n\n## **Provision of services**\n\n#### **Work processes**\n\nIn view of the ever-increasing complexity and interoperability of the products offered, there are steadily growing demands placed on the development of internal work processes. This also involves an ever-higher degree of coordination The particular challenge is to ensure quality standards especially in view of fast-changing market events – and on numerous differing domestic and foreign markets.\n\nThe Company counters these risks by continuously developing and enhancing its internal processes, pooling and retaining its experts and key personnel, and continuously optimizing its organizational structures.\n\n#### **Information security**\n\nUnited Internet generates its commercial success largely in the telecommunications market and within the environment of the internet. In order to provide products and services, the Company uses information and telecommunication technologies (data centers, transmission systems, connection nodes, etc.) in its business processes which are closely networked with the internet and whose availability may be endangered by threats from the internet.\n\nIn order to continue to deal with such risks quickly, the existing monitoring, building access, and alarm system, together with the necessary processes and documentation, is continuously optimized.\n\nThere is also the risk of hacker attacks with the aim of stealing or deleting customer data, or using services fraudulently. In the fiscal year 2023, an increasing professionalization of the attackers and their attack methods was observed once again. According to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the number of new malicious program variants detected daily reached an average of 250,000 in the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. In connection with the war in Ukraine, pro-Russian hacktivist attacks were seen as a threat, although they did not cause any lasting damage and were regarded more as a propaganda tool.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnited Internet counters this risk with the aid of virus scanners, firewalling concepts, self-initiated tests, and various technical monitoring mechanisms.\n\nThe threat potential of the internet is one of the largest threat groups for United Internet with regard to its effects, which are all monitored and reduced by numerous technical and organizational measures. Of particular relevance in this respect are the operation and continuous improvement of the security management system and the steady enhancement of system resilience.\n\n#### **Capacity bottlenecks**\n\nDue to temporary or permanent shortages of technical resources, e.g., due to the temporary overloading of systems or a lack of resources to operate data centers, existing capacities might be exceeded and consequently the planned provision of services could be jeopardized, threatening a corresponding loss of sales. Risks from the procurement of resources, such as products or services on the market, are not taken into account here.\n\nIn order to counter these marginally increased risks, several internal stores are maintained which are continuously adapted to delivery times on the global market. In addition, the Company is in close contact with energy suppliers, for example, in order to coordinate emergency concepts regarding the data centers. In the case of outages, these can be compensated for at short notice by implementing the aforementioned measures.\n\n#### **Projects**\n\nThe classic project objectives of quality, time, and budget are defined before or at the start of a project and are thus the subject of entrepreneurial planning. If potential risks already become apparent in the course of planning or project design or if negative deviations from these plans become apparent in the course of a project's implementation, these are recorded as risks. Moreover, projects may also involve risks that do not affect the project itself but arise after the project has been completed (e.g., security vulnerabilities in new software code).\n\n1&1 faces a variety of technical project risks as part of the construction and operation of its mobile network. The challenge is to migrate all customers to the company's own network within the next two years. If this does not succeed as planned, it could lead to dissatisfaction among the customers affected and ultimately to customer losses. 1&1 launched its customer migration projects at an early stage and developed concepts together with its partners to ensure the success of the customer migration.\n\nActive project management ensures that risk-reducing measures are already implemented during the project. In addition to maintaining the current professional project management, the Company reduces the aforementioned risks by holding regular specialist project management training courses, in order to improve such aspects as security or data privacy requirements. Project objectives are also closely monitored by management and the Controlling division.\n\n#### **Technical plant operation**\n\nUnited Internet's products and related business processes are based on a complex technical infrastructure and a number of success-critical software systems (servers, customer relationship databases, and statistics systems, etc.). Constantly adapting this infrastructure to changing customer needs leads to greater complexity and regular changes. In addition to major events, like the migration of databases, this may lead to various disruptions or defects. Should this affect our business systems or their databases, for example, daily account debiting may be delayed or no longer possible. Should this affect our performance systems, for example, United Internet may not be able to provide its customers with the promised service, on a temporary or longer-term basis.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company meets these risks by making targeted adjustments to the architecture, introducing quality assurance measures, and establishing spatially separated (geo-redundant) core functionalities.\n\nFor the operation of systems, there is a risk of targeted attacks from inside and outside the Company, e.g., from hackers or manipulation by staff with access rights, which may result in non-availability or a deterioration of services.\n\nIn order to counter this risk, the Company takes a wide variety of software- and hardware-based safety precautions to protect the infrastructure and its availability. By dividing responsibilities, the Company has made sure that activities or business transactions involving risks are not carried out by single employees but on the basis of the \"double-check principle\". Manual and technical access restrictions also ensure that employees may only operate within their particular area of responsibility. As an additional precautionary measure against data loss, all data are regularly backed up and stored in separate, i.e., geo-redundant, data centers.\n\n## **Compliance**\n\n#### **Data privacy**\n\nIt can never be fully ruled out that data privacy regulations may be contravened, e.g., by human error or technical weaknesses. In such cases, United Internet faces fines and the loss of customer confidence.\n\nUnited Internet stores the data of its customers on servers according to international security standards at its own and at rented data centers. The handling of these data is subject to extensive legal regulations.\n\nThe Company is aware of this great responsibility and attaches a high degree of importance and care to data privacy. By using state-of-the-art technologies, continuously monitoring all data-privacy and other legal regulations, providing extensive staff training, and involving data protection aspects and requirements as early as possible in product development, United Internet continuously invests in improving the standard of its data privacy.\n\n#### **Misconduct & irregularities**\n\nNon-compliance with legal regulations may result in legal consequences and fines. In order to ensure compliance with legal regulations and internal guidelines, the Management Board of United Internet AG has set up a Group-wide risk-oriented Compliance Management System (CMS).\n\nIn the reporting period, the CMS was further developed, particularly in terms of its organizational structure, and Corporate Compliance at the level of the Group's parent company was more closely integrated with the segment compliance units at the level of the four segments Consumer Access, Business Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications. This led to a reduction in risk.\n\n#### **Legislation & regulation**\n\nChanges in existing legislation, the enactment of new laws, and changes in government regulation issues may have unexpected negative effects on the business models pursued by United Internet and their further development. The decisions of the Federal Network Agency and the Federal Cartel Office have an influence on network access and the pricing of internet access tariffs. As United Internet purchases advance services for its own customers, regulatory changes may have a negative impact on the profitability of its own tariffs. In the same way, there is also the possibility that a lack of regulation may lead to a deterioration of market circumstances for United Internet.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n1&1's frequency acquisition in 2019 was tied to the fulfillment of certain regulatory requirements. Among other things, 1&1 was obliged to put 1,000 5G base stations into operation by the end of 2022, distributed proportionately across Germany's federal states. Due to delivery difficulties of the upstream providers commissioned by 1&1 to provide the antenna locations, 1&1 had fallen well short of this target by the end of 2022. Compliance with the frequency requirements is closely monitored by the Federal Network Agency. Non-compliance may result in a fine and, in the worst case, the revocation of frequency usage rights. As a result of the failure to meet the rollout target by the end of 2022, the Federal Network Agency is currently considering a corresponding sanction in the form of a fine. Moreover, there are requirements that the mobile communications network must cover 25 percent of households by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030. Failure to meet these targets could also result in fines or, in the worst case, the withdrawal of frequencies.\n\nIn connection with the construction of a high-performance 5G mobile network, 1&1 is dependent on the allocation of relevant frequencies by the Federal Network Agency. Low-band frequencies are expected to be reallocated in 2026. There is a risk that 1&1 will not be included in the allocation of these frequencies and that instead the frequency allocation to the established network operators will be prolonged. In this case, 1&1 would be forced to purchase a higher volume of advance services, which would have a negative impact on its value creation. Due to their physical properties, low-band frequencies have a greater range and better penetration capacity than high-band frequencies and thus enable cost-effective coverage in rural areas with mobile phone masts located far apart from each other while also ensuring good reception inside buildings. Without access to these low-band frequencies with a greater range, the risk of failing to meet the Federal Network Agency's expansion obligations by the end of 2025 would also increase considerably.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to counter this tendency toward an increasing regulation risk by cooperating with various pre-service providers and by actively participating in the activities of industry associations.\n\n#### **Litigation**\n\nUnited Internet is currently involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings arising from its normal business activities. The outcome is by definition uncertain and thus represents a risk. Insofar as the prospects of success are negative in specific cases and the size of the obligation can be reliably estimated, accruals are formed for such risks from litigation.\n\nIn 2019, an advance service provider filed claims against 1&1 in the low three-digit million range (for the purposes of internal classification, amounts of up to € 333 million are defined as being in the low threedigit million range, and the claims filed do not exceed this amount in total). 1&1 considers the claims of the respective counterparty to be unfounded and regards an outflow of resources as unlikely.\n\n#### **Tax risks**\n\nAs an internationally operating company, United Internet is subject to the tax laws applicable in the respective countries. Risks may arise from changes in tax laws and double taxation agreements, or case law, as well as from differences in the interpretation of existing regulations. Compared to December 31, 2022, there has been an increase in this risk field. This is due to new knowledge regarding sales and income tax risks, among other things, and the associated revaluation of the risk assessment.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks by continuously expanding its existing tax management system.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Finance**\n\n#### **Financing**\n\nThe main financial liabilities incurred by United Internet AG for the financing of its activities include bank loans, overdraft facilities, and other financial liabilities. Some of the bank loans are subject to financial covenants. Non-compliance with these covenants can have a negative impact on the financing of the United Internet Group. In extreme cases, a loan might be terminated. As of the balance sheet date, the Company almost exclusively held primary financial instruments.\n\nThe aim of financial risk management is to limit risks through ongoing operating and financial activities.\n\n#### **Fraud & credit default**\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of dynamic customer growth and provide services as quickly as possible in the interests of its customers, United Internet has largely automated its order and provision processes – as have many other companies in such mass market businesses. The nature of such automated processes provides possibilities for attacks from fraudsters. Due to the strong appeal of the products and services offered, not only the number of customers is increasing but also the number of non-payers and fraudsters. Consequently, the amount of credit default has risen.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to prevent such fraud attacks – or at least to recognize and end them at an early stage – by permanently expanding its fraud management capabilities, working closely with preservice providers, and taking account of such risks in the design of its products.\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nThe general liquidity risk of United Internet AG consists of the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its financial obligations, such as the redemption of financial debts. The Company's objective is to continuously cover its financial needs and secure flexibility, for example by using overdraft facilities and loans.\n\nGroup-wide cash requirements and surpluses are managed centrally by the cash management system. By netting these cash requirements and surpluses within the Group, the amount of external bank transactions can be minimized. This is managed, e.g., by using cash pooling processes. The Company has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank accounts and internal netting accounts, as well as for the execution of automated payment transactions. In addition to operating liquidity, United Internet AG also holds other liquidity reserves, which are available at short notice.\n\n## **Acts of God**\n\nExternal events such as natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, etc.), personnel crises (pandemics, strikes, etc.), infrastructure crises (power outages, road damage, etc.), or violent incidents (rampage, terrorist attacks, war, etc.) may affect United Internet's operations.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks as far as possible with a variety of measures. Examples include the establishment of building access restrictions, the operation of georedundant data centers, or hygiene precautions, location-independent workplaces, the use of modern communication media to avoid travel, and the elaboration of emergency concepts.\n\nThe latter has become more important as a result of the growing geopolitical tensions. The United Internet Group has taken this as an opportunity to revise its existing security measures and concepts and, if necessary, to adapt them to the higher threat levels.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Additional disclosures on risks, financial instruments, and financial risk management** \n\nFurther details on risks, financial instruments, and financial risk management are provided in note 43 \"Objectives and methods of financial risk management\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Additional disclosures on sustainability risks**\n\nInformation on sustainability risks can be found in the Sustainability Report 2023, which will be published at the end of March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/investorrelations/publikationen/berichte.html).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's risk position\n\nThe assessment of the overall level of risk is based on a consolidated view of all significant risk fields and individual risks, also taking account of their interdependencies.\n\n- From the current perspective, the main challenges are the risk fields \"Legislation & regulation\", \"Litigation\", \"Information security\", and \"Technical plant operation\".\n- The risk assessment of the risk field \"Personnel recruitment\" rose from Low to Moderate. The background to this change is the difficulty of attracting the required IT specialists.\n- There was also an increase from Low to Moderate for the risk field \"Capacity bottlenecks\". This was due to a slightly increased risk in the Business Applications segment.\n- And there was an increase in the risk field \"Tax risks\" from Low to Moderate. The reason for this increase is enhanced risk awareness, which has led to an increased identification of risks in this field.\n- The risk assessment of the risk field \"Business development & innovations\" could be reduced from Moderate to Low. The background to this reduction is an improved risk position in the Consumer Access segment.\n- Thanks to the implementation of measures and the closure of risks, the risk field \"Misconduct & irregularities\" has also fallen from Moderate to Low.\n- Otherwise, the risk classifications of the risk fields of United Internet AG as at December 31, 2023 were unchanged from December 31, 2022.\n\nThe continuous expansion of its risk management system enables the United Internet Group to limit risks to a minimum, where economically sensible, by implementing specific measures.\n\nCompared to the previous year, there was an increase in the overall risk. In addition to the aforementioned risk fields \"Tax risks\", \"Personnel recruitment\", and \"Capacity bottlenecks\", the main risk increases were in the fields of \"Litigation\" and \"Procurement market\", although the increase in the latter two risk areas did not lead to an overall increase in the risk classification.\n\nIn the assessment of the overall risk situation, the existing opportunities in the United Internet Group were not taken into consideration. There were no risks which directly jeopardized the continued existence of the United Internet Group in the fiscal year 2023, nor as of the preparation date for this Management Report, neither from individual risk positions nor from the overall risk situation.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Probability of occurrence, potential damage, and the classification of risks

|\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nSociety, politics and the economy are currently facing complex macroeconomic challenges resulting from a combination of high interest rates, subdued growth expectations, a tense financing framework, falling trade growth and declining confidence among companies and consumers. In addition to the destabilizing effects of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East is also contributing to greater uncertainty about the economic future. The United Internet Group is responding to this by actively accepting the current challenges and integrating them into its business decisions, in particular by developing strategies to minimize risk, such as reducing the proportion of variable-interest debt or through diversified procurement strategies to ensure a secure and fair energy supply.\n\nAlthough the United Internet Group has no business activities in the countries involved in the wars, it is still confronted with the indirect effects. In view of the uncertain security situation caused by the war in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, especially surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, and the potential indirect effects on global business activities, United Internet has developed proactive risk management and mitigation strategies:\n\n- Cybersecurity risks: due to the increased cybersecurity threats associated with the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, the Company is stepping up its investment in cybersecurity measures. These include the use of advanced monitoring technologies, conducting regular security audits and training employees to improve their resistance to cyberattacks.\n- Hardware bottlenecks: the Company is adapting its logistics and procurement strategies in order to overcome potential hardware bottlenecks that could be caused by the uncertain security situation surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, exacerbated by the war in the Middle East. Among other things, this is being done by increasing the stock of hardware in order to cushion potential supply disruptions.\n\nThe Management Board and the operational managers will closely monitor further developments and initiate any appropriate countermeasures (if possible).\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4.2 Opportunity report\n\n## Opportunity management\n\nOpportunity management is based on strategic planning and the resulting measures for the development of products and their positioning for various target groups, markets, and countries during the product life cycle.\n\nThe Group Management Board, as well as the operative management level of the respective business segments, have the direct responsibility for the early and continuous identification, assessment, and steering of opportunities.\n\nThe management team of United Internet AG makes extensive use of detailed evaluations, models, and scenarios on current and future trends regarding sectors, technologies, products, markets/market potential, and competitors in the Group's fields of activity. The potential opportunities identified during these strategic analyses are then examined with regard to the critical success factors and existing external conditions and possibilities of United Internet AG in planning discussions between the Management Board, Supervisory Board, and operational managers before being implemented in the form of specific measures, targets, and milestones.\n\nThe progress and success of these measures is continuously monitored by operational management, as well as the managing directors and management board members of the respective companies.\n\n# Opportunities for United Internet\n\nUnited Internet's stable and largely non-cyclical business model ensures predictable revenues and cash flows, thus providing the financial flexibility to grasp opportunities in new business fields and markets – organically or via investments and acquisitions.\n\n## **Broad strategic positioning in growth markets**\n\nIn view of its broad positioning in current growth markets, the Company's purely strategic growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, permanently available, and increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. From the current perspective, these internet-based programs for home users, freelancers, and small companies are likely to be United Internet's growth drivers over the coming years – both as stand-alone products in the Consumer Applications and Business Applications segments, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in our Consumer Access segment.\n\n## **Participation in market growth**\n\nDespite the uncertain macroeconomic conditions, United Internet – as well as many of the sector's leading analysts – expects further progress in those markets of importance to the Company. United Internet is one of the leading players in these markets. At home and abroad. With its highly competitive Access products, its growing portfolio of cloud applications, its strong and specialized brands, its high sales strength, and already established business relationships with millions of private and business\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\ncustomers (cross-selling and up-selling potential), United Internet is also well positioned to participate in the expected market growth of both its business divisions.\n\n## **Expansion of market positions**\n\nUnited Internet AG is now one of the leaders in many of its business fields. Based on its existing technological know-how, its high level of product and service quality, the widespread popularity of Group brands such as 1&1, GMX or WEB.DE, its business relationships with millions of private and business customers, and its high customer retention ratio, United Internet sees good opportunities to build on its current market shares.\n\n## **Entry into new business fields**\n\nOne of United Internet's core competencies is to recognize customer wishes, trends, and thus new markets at an early stage. With its broadly based value chain (from product development and data center operation, to effective marketing, powerful sales organization, and active customer support), United Internet is often faster at placing innovations on the market and – thanks to the high level of cash generation in its existing business fields – capable of providing them with strong marketing support.\n\n## **Use of artificial intelligence (AI)**\n\nThe potential of AI applications is immense, particularly in the IT sector. United Internet uses AI to optimize processes and increase efficiency, for example by automating routine tasks in software development, customer service and marketing as well as for the analysis of large data volumes.\n\nHowever, there are also many opportunities at product level for companies such as United Internet to use AI to optimize existing products for their customers or to develop new products in the field of AI in order to acquire new customers and increase customer loyalty. For example, IONOS helps its customers build their websites with the aid of an AI website generator. This enables customers to independently generate website suggestions in a matter of seconds based on just a few details (such as sector and relevant keywords) – AI takes care of the design, images, texts, and search engine optimization.\n\n## **Extending vertical integration: own landline infrastructure**\n\nSince its acquisition of 1&1 Versatel (2014), United Internet operates its own telecommunications network, which is being constantly expanded. With a current length of over 61,000 km, it is one of Germany's largest fiber-optic networks. This network infrastructure gives United Internet the opportunity to extend its vertical integration and also gradually reduce its purchases of wholesale broadband services for the B2C segment.\n\nIn addition, having its own network also offers United Internet the opportunity to systematically expand its B2B data and infrastructure business with SMEs and large corporations. The scale of this opportunity is underlined by the considerable pent-up demand for direct fiber-optic connections in Germany. According to the latest survey of the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) in December 2022, only 9.2% (end of 2021: 7.1%) of all broadband connections in Germany are fiberoptic connections. Germany therefore still lags well behind in 36th place among the 38 OECD countries\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nsurveyed, and is well below the leaders Korea (88.0%), Japan (84.8%), and Spain (83.1%), as well as below the OECD average of 37.7% (end of 2021: 34.3%).\n\n## **Extending vertical integration: rollout of own mobile communications network**\n\nWith the launch of mobile services in 1&1's mobile network in December 2023, United Internet's subsidiary 1&1 established the key prerequisites for extending its vertical integration in this market segment – as in the landline segment. 1&1 has since been producing advance services for new customers in its own network. Wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient network coverage during the network rollout, it uses the national roaming advance services of Telefónica. As of summer 2024, these national roaming advance services are to be provided by Vodafone. National roaming is a standard procedure used in the rollout of new mobile networks that enables customers to surf and make calls without interruption in areas not yet covered during the construction phase of the new network. This is achieved by automatically using the roaming partner's antennas in these areas.\n\nUntil the launch of mobile services on its own network, 1&1 had extensive access to Telefónica's mobile network in Germany (as a so-called MBA MVNO) and also used capacities from other advance service providers such as Vodafone. As of the beginning of 2024, 1&1's existing customers on these third-party networks are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network in order to increasingly replace the purchase of advance services from third parties and instead use internally produced advance services.\n\nDespite the initial delay in the rollout of antenna locations, 1&1 is still pursuing its goal of covering a quarter of German households by the end of 2025 and half by the end of 2030. To this end, additional partners have been acquired for the network rollout. The company therefore expects to make up for the delays in the course of the rollout phase.\n\n## **High degree of vertical integration for applications**\n\nIn its Applications segment, United Internet covers the entire value creation chain. Applications are developed at the Company's own \"Internet Factories\" or in cooperation with partner firms and operated on over 100,000 servers at the Company's 11 own data centers and 21 co-locations. This enables United Internet to maintain high quality standards and to respond quickly to customer needs and changing market situations in order to win new customers and retain existing ones.\n\n## **Internationalization**\n\nCloud applications can be used anywhere in the world and work on the same principle in Frankfurt as they do in London, Rome, or New York. In the past, United Internet has already successfully adapted cloud products many times to various languages and country-specific features and gradually rolled them out in different nations.\n\nThanks to the high degree of exportability which these products offer, United Internet is already active in its Applications segment in numerous European countries (Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden), as well as in North America (USA, Canada, and Mexico). Further countries and product rollouts will gradually follow.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Acquisitions and investments**\n\nIn addition to organic growth, United Internet also constantly examines the possibility of company acquisitions and strategic investments. Thanks to its high and plannable level of free cash flow, United Internet also has a strong source of internal funding and good access to debt financing markets in order to utilize opportunities in the form of acquisitions and investments.\n\nUnited Internet has enhanced its market standing in Germany and abroad, for example, by making several acquisitions and strategic investments while gaining considerable expertise in the field of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and company integration. The most important M&A activities of the past include the acquisition of WEB.DE's portal business (in 2005), the acquisitions of Fasthosts (2006) and united-domains (2008), the acquisition of freenet's broadband business (2009), and the acquisitions of mail.com (2010), Arsys (2013), Versatel (2014; now 1&1 Versatel), home.pl (2015), STRATO (2017), ProfitBricks (2017; now IONOS Cloud), Drillisch (2017; now 1&1), World4You (2018), and we22 (2021). The most important strategic investments include the investments in Open-Xchange (2013), uberall (2014), Tele Columbus (2016), rankingCoach (2017), AWIN (2017; via the contribution of affilinet), and Stackable (2021).\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's opportunity position\n\nIn view of its broad positioning in current growth markets, the Company's growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, permanently available, and increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. From the current perspective, these internet-based programs for home users, freelancers, and small companies are likely to be United Internet’s growth drivers over the coming years – both as stand-alone products in the Consumer Applications and Business Applications segments, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in the Consumer Access segment. Based predominantly on electronic subscriptions with fixed monthly amounts and contractually agreed terms, United Internet's business model ensures stable and plannable revenue and cash flows. Against this backdrop, the Company's Management Board is convinced that it will continue to be in a position to deal successfully with challenges and seize opportunities.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4.3 Forecast report\n\n## Expectations for the economy\n\nIn its global economic outlook published on January 30, 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) updated its forecasts for the development of the global economies in 2024 and 2025. In view of the current fall in inflation and the recent upturn in growth, the IMF raised the forecast for the global economy in its update from 2.9% to 3.1% for 2024 (after 3.1% in 2023). Nevertheless, global economic growth will once again fall well short of the average figure for recent years of 3.8%. For 2025, the IMF forecasts global economic growth of 3.2%.\n\nAccording to the IMF, there are risks associated with geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, which have already led to a significant increase in prices for freight shipments between Asia and Europe.\n\nThe latest IMF forecasts for United Internet's target markets in North America (the USA, Canada, and Mexico) are as follows: the US economy is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025 (after 2.5% in 2023); in Canada, economic growth of 1.4% and 2.3% is anticipated for 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 1.1% in 2023); and the Mexican economy is expected to grow by 2.7% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025 (after 3.4% in 2023).\n\nThe IMF anticipates growth of 0.9% and 1.7% in the eurozone for 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 0.5% in 2023).\n\nLikewise, the IMF expects no more than minor economic growth in United Internet's main EU markets (France, Spain, and Italy): the economists anticipate growth of 1.0% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025 for France (after 0.8% in 2023); growth in Spain is expected to reach 1.5% and 2.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 2.4% in 2023); and for Italy, the IMF forecasts growth of 0.7% and 1.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 0.6% in 2023).\n\nFor the non-EU country the UK, the IMF expects an increase in economic output of 0.6% in 2024 and growth of 1.6% in 2025 (after 0.5% in 2023).\n\nFor United Internet's most important market, Germany, the IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 (after -0.3% in 2023). According to the outlooks, Germany is likely to have the lowest growth of all G7 states again in 2024.\n\nWith expected growth of 0.5% in 2024, the IMF is above the forecast of the German government, which, in its 2024 Annual Economic Report on February 21, 2024, forecast growth for price-adjusted gross domestic product of just 0.2% in 2024.\n\nThe German government cites the ongoing geopolitical crises, the impact of the energy price crisis, the overall distinct weakness of the global economy and the increasingly noticeable effects of restrictive monetary policy as the reasons for this estimate.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n|          | 2025e | 2024e | 2023  |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| World    | 3.2%  | 3.1%  | 3.1%  |\n| USA      | 1.7%  | 2.1%  | 2.5%  |\n| Canada   | 2.3%  | 1.4%  | 1.1%  |\n| Mexico   | 1.5%  | 2.7%  | 3.4%  |\n| Eurozone | 1.7%  | 0.9%  | 0.5%  |\n| France   | 1.7%  | 1.0%  | 0.8%  |\n| Spain    | 2.1%  | 1.5%  | 2.4%  |\n| Italy    | 1.1%  | 0.7%  | 0.7%  |\n| Poland   | 3.2%  | 2.8%  | 0.6%  |\n| UK       | 1.6%  | 0.6%  | 0.5%  |\n| Germany  | 1.6%  | 0.5%  | -0.3% |\n\n**Market forecast: GDP development of most important economies for United Internet** \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2024\n\n# Sector/market expectations\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the adverse macroeconomic conditions, disrupted supply chains, and the shortage of skilled workers, the industry association Bitkom expects the German ICT market as a whole to grow by 4.4% (prior year: 2.0%) to € 224.3 billion in 2024.\n\nAccording to Bitkom calculations, the IT market is expected to grow again – after a brief dip in growth in 2023 – by 6.1% (prior year: 2.2%) to € 151.5 billion in 2024. Driven in particular by cloud and AI technologies, software is likely to be the fastest-growing segment again with a strong increase of 9.4% (prior year: 9.6%) to € 45.5 billion. Growth of 4.8% (prior year: 5.1%) to € 51.7 billion is expected for the IT services business, which also includes IT consulting. And sales of IT hardware are also set for a return to significant growth with an expected increase of 4.6% (prior year: -5.4%) to € 54.5 billion. The strongest growth driver is still Infrastructure-as-Service, i.e., rented servers, network and storage capacities.\n\nBy contrast, the consumer electronics market will remain under pressure. According to a Bitkom forecast, sales are likely to decline again in 2024 by an estimated -3.4% (prior year: -2.1%) to € 7.8 billion.\n\nThe most important ICT markets for United Internet's business model are the German telecommunications market (broadband connections and mobile internet) for its mostly subscriptionfinanced Access division, and the global cloud computing and German online advertising markets for its subscription- and ad-financed Applications division.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Telecommunications market in Germany**\n\nThe industry association Bitkom expects the German telecommunications market to grow in total by 1.0% (prior year: 1.7%) to € 72.8 billion. The strongest growth in this segment is expected to come from business with telecommunications services, which is set to grow by 1.6% (prior year: 1.9%) to € 52.6 billion. Total spending on telecommunications infrastructure is expected to decrease slightly by -1.0% (prior year: 4.4%) to € 8.4 billion. Sales of end-user devices are likely to be on a par with the previous year with a slight decline of -0.2% (prior year: -0.7%) to € 11.8 billion.\n\n#### **Market forecast: telecommunications market in Germany**\n\n| in € billion | 2024e | 2023 | Change |\n|--------------|-------|------|--------|\n| Sales        | 72.8  | 72.1 | + 1.0% |\n\nSource: Bitkom, January 2024\n\n## **Global cloud computing market**\n\nFollowing the very strong growth of 2023 (17.8%), Gartner forecasts global growth for public cloud services of 20.4% to USD 678.79 billion in 2024.\n\n#### **Market forecast: global cloud computing**\n\n| in \\$ billion                                      | 2024e  | 2023   | Change  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Global sales of public cloud services              | 678.79 | 563.59 | + 20.4% |\n| thereof Application Infrastructure Services (PaaS) | 176.49 | 145.32 | + 21.5% |\n| thereof Application Services (SaaS)                | 243.99 | 205.22 | + 18.9% |\n| thereof Business Process Services (BPaaS)          | 72.92  | 66.34  | + 9.9%  |\n| thereof Desktop as a Service (DaaS)                | 3.16   | 2.78   | + 13.5% |\n| thereof System Infrastructure Services (IaaS)      | 182.22 | 143.93 | + 26.6% |\n\nSource: Gartner, Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update, November 2023\n\n## **Online advertising market in Germany**\n\nAfter a 7.0% increase in online advertising in 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers expects further growth in 2024 with an increase in total market volume (mobile advertising and desktop advertising) of 5.3% to € 14.18 billion.\n\n#### **Market forecast: total online advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to PwC**\n\n| in € billion                | 2024e | 2023  | Change |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Online advertising revenues | 14.18 | 13.47 | + 5.3% |\n\nSource: PricewaterhouseCoopers, German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 – 2027, September 2023\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Expectations for the Company in 2024\n\n## **Forecast for the fiscal year 2024**\n\n- United Internet AG expects an increase in consolidated sales (acc. to IFRS) to approx. € 6.5 billion for its fiscal year 2024 (2023: € 6.213 billion).\n- Operating EBITDA (acc. to IFRS) is expected to grow to € 1.42 billion in 2024 (2023: € 1.300 billion).\n\nThe Company will continue to invest heavily in 2024, especially in the expansion of its fiber-optic network and mobile communications network. Cash capital expenditures are likely to be 10 - 20% above the prior-year figure (2023: € 756 million).\n\nDue to its role as a holding company, the earnings of United Internet AG at parent company level are mainly influenced by its investment result (profit transfers and dividends) and the interest result. From the current perspective (subject to possible special items), the Management Board expects a balanced net income for the fiscal year 2024 (2023: € 274.0 million including special items of € 219.1 million from the IONOS IPO).\n\nUnited Internet AG intends to maintain its shareholder-friendly dividend policy based on continuity in the coming years. Dividend payouts will continue to represent approx. 20 - 40% of adjusted net income from continued operations after minority interests (adjusted net income attributable to \"shareholders of United Internet AG” — according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income) in the future. The prerequisite is that funds are not required for further Company development.\n\n## **Management Board's overall statement on the anticipated development**\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG is upbeat about its prospects for the future. Thanks to a business model based predominantly on electronic subscriptions, United Internet believes it is largely stable enough to withstand cyclical influences. And with the investments made over the past few years in customer relationships, new business fields and further internationalization, as well as via acquisitions and investments, the Company has broadened the foundations for further growth.\n\nUnited Internet will continue to pursue this sustainable business policy in the coming years. The segments will focus on the following topics:\n\n- In addition to the rollout of the 1&1 mobile network, the Consumer Access segment will focus in particular on marketing mobile internet products and winning high-quality customer relationships in the fiscal year 2024.\n- In the Business Access segment, the fiber-optic network is to be expanded further in 2024 with the connection of new locations. In addition, the business customer and wholesale business will continue to be developed.\n- In fiscal year 2024, the key topics in the Consumer Applications segment will again be the further expansion of data-driven business models and a focus on fee-based premium products.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n The Business Applications segment will continue to focus on expanding business with existing customers and gaining new high-quality customer relationships in 2023. In addition, the segment will expand its cloud business in particular.\n\nFollowing a successful start to the year, the Company's Management Board believes that (at the time of preparing this Management Report) the Company is on track to reach the forecast presented above in the section \"Forecast for the fiscal year 2024\".\n\n#### **Forward-looking statements**\n\nThis Management Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, and projections of the Management Board of United Internet AG and currently available information. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and are based upon expectations, assumptions, and projections that may not prove to be accurate. United Internet AG does not guarantee that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and does not accept any obligation, nor have the intention, to adjust or update the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 5. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) recommends disclosures on the internal control and risk management system. These go beyond the statutory requirements for the management report and are not included in the auditor's review of the content of the management report (\"nonmanagement report-related disclosures”). In chapter 5 “Internal control system and risk management system”, they are thematically assigned to the main elements of the internal control and risk management system and are separated from the disclosures to be audited by separate paragraphs and marked accordingly as “unaudited”.\n\n## **Internal control system (unaudited)**\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) of United Internet AG covers the entire organization and serves to maintain the functionality and efficiency of business processes, the reliability of operational information, the safeguarding of assets, and compliance with regulations. To this end, the controls carried out include adherence to planned processes, the \"four-eye principle\", and the separation of functions. The controls are defined on the basis of uniform categorizations for each process and are carried out both centrally in some cases and decentrally throughout the Group. Defined processes, which involve those responsible in the specialist areas as well as process experts, ensure that process and organizational risks are countered in a preventive manner. Together and in cooperation with Risk Management, all units of the Group assess if there are any organizational and process risks and whether these could have an impact on the ICS. The ICS is regularly enhanced, also with the involvement of experts. Monitoring is based on the three pillars of Risk Management, Corporate Audit and external auditors. Corporate Audit evaluates and improves governance processes and risk management and also assesses the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS by conducting regular spot checks.\n\n## **Accounting-related internal control system and risk management system**\n\nIn accordance with section 289 (4) and section 315 (4) German Commercial Code (HGB), United Internet AG is obliged to describe the main features of its accounting-related internal control system and risk management system in its Management Report.\n\nUnited Internet AG regards risk management as part of its internal control system (ICS). The ICS is understood as an ongoing process comprising organizational, controlling, and monitoring structures to ensure permanent compliance with legal and corporate requirements.\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG is responsible for the scope and structure of its ICS and takes account of the Company's specific requirements. The monitoring of the ICS's effectiveness is one of the duties of the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG, which is regularly informed by the Management Board about the status of the ICS and the findings of the Company's Internal Audit system. Within the United Internet Group, the Corporate Audit department is responsible for independently auditing the appropriateness, effectiveness, and functionality of the ICS and has been granted extensive rights with regard to information, examination, and access in order to exercise its duties. Its audits are based on a risk-oriented audit plan which also includes regular audits of subsidiaries. In addition, the Corporate Audit department conducts fundamental audits regarding the proper functioning of important asset and inventory stock-taking. In addition, those areas of ICS of relevance for financial reporting are audited with regard to efficiency by the external auditors as part of their risk-oriented audit approach.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting-related ICS is continuously being developed and comprises principles, procedures, and measures to secure the effectiveness, economic efficiency, and compliance of the accounting system and to ensure that the relevant laws and standards are observed. During preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the ICS is used in particular to ensure the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union, and the additional provisions under commercial law pursuant to section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). When preparing the Annual Financial Statements and Management Report, the ICS also helps ensure that regulations under commercial law are observed.\n\nHowever, a fundamental aspect of every ICS, irrespective of its particular design, is that it cannot provide absolute safety that material misstatements in accounting are avoided or detected. This may be due, e.g., to incorrect discretionary decisions of individuals, faulty controls, or criminal acts.\n\nThe following statements refer solely to the fully consolidated subsidiaries included in the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG, for which United Internet AG has the direct or indirect possibility of determining their financial and monetary policy in order to derive a benefit from the activity of these companies.\n\nThe task of United Internet AG's risk management system includes setting measures to detect and assess risks, reduce them to an acceptable level, and monitor recognized risks. A risk management system requires organized action to deal suitably with uncertainty and threats and urges employees to utilize the regulations and instruments required to ensure compliance with the risk management principles. In addition to operative risk management, it also includes the systematic early recognition, management, and monitoring of risks. The accounting-related risk management system focuses on the risk of false statements in accounting and external reporting.\n\nSpecific accounting-related risks may arise, for example, from the conclusion of unusual or complex transactions. Business transactions which cannot be processed in a routine manner are also exposed to latent risks. It is necessary to grant a limited circle of people certain scope for discretion in the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, which may result in further accounting-related risks.\n\nThe accounting-related ICS comprises internal controls, defined on the basis of risk aspects, for those processes which are relevant for financial reporting as well as those processes that support the IT systems. Special emphasis is placed on IT security, change management, and operational IT processes. Organizational, preventive, and detective controls are applied, which can be conducted manually or with the aid of IT. The effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting-related ICS requires highly developed employee skills. Regular training, the \"four-eye principle\", and the functional separation of administrative, executive, and approval processes are indispensable for the United Internet Group. The Corporate Accounting division and other accounting departments are responsible for the management of the accounting processes. Laws, accounting standards, and other pronouncements are continuously analyzed with regard to their relevance and impact on accounting. The Group's accounting policy sets out and communicates relevant requirements and forms the basis for the financial statement preparation process. In addition, supplementary procedural instructions such as the intercompany guideline, standardized reporting formats, IT systems and computer-aided reporting and consolidation processes support the standardized and compliant Group accounting process. The Corporate Accounting division ensures that these requirements are implemented uniformly throughout the Group. The Group companies are responsible for the orderly and timely execution of the accounting-related processes and systems and are supported by the accounting departments accordingly.\n\nIf significant control weaknesses or opportunities for improvement are detected, they are assessed and countermeasures are developed with the persons responsible to improve the effectiveness of the ICS.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImplementation of the measures is monitored by the Corporate Audit department and may be the subject of subsequent audits. In order to ensure the high quality of the accounting-related ICS, the Corporate Audit department is closely involved during all stages.\n\n## **Effectiveness statement (unaudited)**\n\nBased on its regular review of the internal control system and risk management system, the Management Board is not aware of any circumstances at the time of preparing this Combined Management Report that would speak against or call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY TAKEOVER LAW\n\nThe following disclosures according to sections 289a and 315a German Commercial Code (HGB) represent conditions as of the balance sheet date. As required by section 176 (1) sentence 1 German Stock Corporation Law (\"Aktiengesetz\" – AktG), the disclosures are explained in the sections below.\n\nWith regard to disclosures on the composition of subscribed capital, as well as direct and indirect participating interests in the capital, pursuant to section 289a sentence 1 no. 1 and no. 3 HGB and section 315a sentence 1 no. 1 and 3 HGB, please refer to Note 37 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the notes on equity in the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG as at December 31, 2023.\n\nFor further details, please refer to note 16, as well as 37 - 39, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n# Composition of capital\n\nUpon completion of the capital reduction resolved by the Management Board on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by means of canceling 2,000,000 treasury shares, subscribed capital was reduced to € 192,000,000 as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023 and is divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares. Each share entitles the owner to one vote. There are no other share categories. In the case of a capital increase, the commencement of dividend entitlement for new shares may be determined separately from the moment of contribution. All shares are listed on the stock exchange.\n\n# Limitations affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares\n\nThere are legal limitations affecting voting rights of certain shares pursuant to section 71b AktG and section 71d S. 4 in conjunction with section 71b AktG. Upon completion of the capital reduction resolved by the Management Board on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by means of canceling 2,000,000 treasury shares, and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet held 19,183,705 treasury shares at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares.\n\nThere are also legal limitations affecting voting rights regarding a conflict of interests pursuant to section 136 (1) AktG for shares held by the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nUpon completion of the aforementioned capital reduction and buyback of 13,899,596 shares as part of the public share buyback offer (of which 5,044,795 shares were from Mr. Ralph Dommermuth), Mr. Dommermuth indirectly holds 93,955,205 shares of United Internet AG (48.94% of capital stock) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023. Of the other Management Board members, Mr. Huhn also held 500 shares of the Company (0.00% of capital stock) as of December 31, 2023.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the current members of the Supervisory Board, Mr. Rasch held 12,500 shares (0.01% of capital stock) and Prof. Dr. Söffing held 3,500 shares (0.00% of capital stock) in United Internet AG as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThere are no limitations affecting the transfer of shares.\n\n# Direct and indirect participations in capital with over 10% of voting rights\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company's CEO, Mr. Ralph Dommermuth, residing in Germany, indirectly held 93,955,205 shares or 48.94% of the 192,000,000 shares in United Internet AG. The Management Board is not aware of further participations in capital exceeding 10% of voting rights.\n\n# Special rights\n\nMr. Ralph Dommermuth is personally entitled to nominate two members of the Supervisory Board. This right is exercised by naming a person for the Supervisory Board to the Company's Management Board. The nomination becomes effective as soon as the nominated person declares his acceptance of the Supervisory Board seat to the Management Board. A requirement for the aforementioned nomination right is that Mr. Ralph Dommermuth holds shares himself or via affiliated companies pursuant to section 15f. AktG representing at least 25% of the Company's voting capital and can prove as much to the Management Board on nomination of the Supervisory Board member by providing depository account statements or similar documents. Mr. Dommermuth has so far not made use of this nomination right.\n\nThe Management Board is not aware of any further shares with special rights.\n\n# Appointment and dismissal of Management Board members, amendments to Company articles\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of Management Board members is determined by sections 84, 85 AktG in conjunction with section 1 of the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. According to section 6 (1) of the Company's articles, the Management Board consists of at least one person. The Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, determines their number and can appoint one member of the Management Board as Chairman.\n\nEach amendment of the Company's articles requires the adoption of a shareholders' meeting resolution with a majority of at least three quarters of capital represented at the vote. Pursuant to section 22 of the Company's articles in conjunction with section 179 (1) sentence 2 AktG (Changes in capital stock and number of shares), the Supervisory Board is authorized to make amendments to the Company's articles insofar as they only concern formulation.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Powers of the Management Board to issue new shares\n\nThe Management Board is entitled to issue new shares under the following circumstances:\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to increase, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until August 31, 2026 by a maximum of € 75,000,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par value shares in return for cash and/or non-cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2023). In the case of cash contributions, the new shares may – at the option of the Management Board – also be underwritten, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by one or several credit institutions and/or any other company fulfilling the requirements of section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG subject to the obligation to offer the shares only to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription rights).\n\nSubject to the following restrictions, the shareholders will be granted subscription rights.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, fractional shares from the shareholders' subscription rights and to also exclude subscription rights to the extent necessary in order to grant subscription rights for new shares to bearers of warrants and convertible bonds issued by United Internet AG or its subsidiaries in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligations.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a capital increase in return for cash contributions, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for an amount of up to 10% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted if the new shares are issued at an issuance price which is not substantially below the market price of those Company shares already listed at the time of the final determination of the issuance price, which is to be as near in time as possible to the share issue date. This maximum amount includes any shares that are issued or to be issued under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded; also, the amount must take into account any shares that are issued or sold during the term of this authorization pursuant to or in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights in the event of capital increases in return for non-cash contributions in order to grant shares for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in companies or other assets, including rights and receivables, or as part of business combinations.\n\nThe foregoing authorizations to exclude subscription rights are in aggregate limited to an amount of up to 20% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted. This maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to conversion and/or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds that are issued with warrant and/or conversion rights or conversion obligations during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to treasury shares sold or used during the term of this authorization in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized to determine, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the further details of the capital increase and its execution.\n\nCapital stock is conditionally increased by up to € 18,500,000.00, divided into up to 18,500,000 no-par value registered shares (Conditional Capital 2023). The conditional capital increase shall only be implemented to the extent that the bearers or holders of warrant rights or conversion rights or obligations from bonds with warrants or convertible bonds that have been issued or guaranteed by the Company or a subordinated Group company in the period ending August 31, 2026, on the basis of the Management Board's authorization resolved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023, exercise their warrant or conversion rights or, to the extent that they are obligated to convert their bonds, fulfill their obligation, or to the extent that the Company exercises a right to grant shares in the Company, instead of paying the cash amount due (or parts thereof), and to the extent that cash compensation is not granted or treasury shares or shares in another listed company are not used to service bonds.\n\nThe new shares shall be issued at the warrant or conversion price to be determined in accordance with the above authorizing resolution. The new shares shall participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created; to the extent that it is legally permissible, the Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, determine the profit participation of new shares and, notwithstanding section 60 (2) AktG, also for a fiscal year already expired.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details concerning the execution of the conditional capital increase.\n\n# Powers of the Management Board to buy and use treasury shares\n\nThe authorization to acquire and use treasury shares that was granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 20, 2020 in accordance with section 71 (1) number 8 AktG expired on August 31, 2023. Against this background, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 issued a new authorization pursuant to section 71 (1) number 8 AktG, to acquire and use treasury shares. This authorization is valid from September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2026.\n\nThe authorization is limited to an amount of 10% of the capital stock existing at the time the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopts the resolution or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the authorization is exercised. The authorization can be exercised directly by the Company, or by a dependent or majority-owned corporation of the Company, or by third parties commissioned by dependent or majority-owned corporations of the Company, and permits the purchase of treasury shared in their entirety or in parts on one or more occasions.\n\nTreasury shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer made to all shareholders or by means of a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers or by granting tender rights to shareholders.\n\n If acquisition is made via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer, the per share purchase price (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) paid by the Company must not be more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean of the closing auction prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the conclusion of any transaction imposing an obligation (if the acquisition is made via the stock exchange) or before the publication of the decision \n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nto submit a public purchase offer (if the acquisition is made by means of a public purchase offer). Should the share price deviate significantly from the offered purchase price or from the limits of the offered purchase price range after a public purchase offer is published, the offer may be adjusted. In this case, the relevant purchase price shall be determined based on the corresponding stock exchange price on the last trading day before the announcement of the adjustment and must not be more than 10% higher or lower than that amount.\n\nThe volume of a public purchase offer may be limited. If, in the case of a public purchase offer, the volume of the tendered shares exceeds the volume intended to be bought back, tender rights, if any, may be partially excluded so that shares may be acquired based on the proportions of tendered shares (percentages of tendered shares) rather than based on the proportions of the tendering shareholders' shareholdings in the Company (shareholding percentages). Tender rights, if any, may also be partially excluded such that priority is given to smaller lots of up to 100 shares offered per shareholder and such that the number of shares is rounded in accordance with commercial rounding principles in order to avoid fractions of shares.\n\n If acquisition is made by means of a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers, the Company will stipulate a purchase price range per share within which sales offers may be submitted. The purchase price range may be adjusted if, during the submission period, the share price deviates significantly from the share price prevailing at the time of publication of the request to submit sales offers. The purchase price per share (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) to be paid by the Company and that the Company calculates on the basis of the received sales offers must not be more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean of the closing auction prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the cutoff date described below. The cutoff date is the date on which the Company's Management Board makes its final and formal decision on the publication of the request to submit sales offers or the adjustment thereof.\n\nThe volume of offers that may be accepted may be limited. If, due to the limited volume, not all of several equal sales offers can be accepted, tender rights, if any, may be partially excluded so that shares may be acquired based on the percentages of tendered shares rather than based on the shareholding percentages. Tender rights, if any, may also be partially excluded such that priority is given to smaller lots of up to 100 shares tendered per shareholder and such that the number of shares is rounded in accordance with commercial rounding principles in order to avoid fractions of shares.\n\n If acquisition is made by granting tender rights to the shareholders, the rights may be allocated per Company share. A number of tender rights determined based on the ratio of the Company's capital stock to the volume of shares to be bought back by the Company will entitle a tendering shareholder to sell one Company share to the Company. Tender rights may also be allocated in such a way that one tender right is allocated for a certain number of shares determined based on the ratio of the capital stock to the buyback volume. Fractions of tender rights will not be allocated; in case thereof, partial tender rights are excluded. The price or the limits of the offered purchase price range (in each case excluding ancillary acquisition costs) at which a share may be sold to the Company when a tender right is exercised will be determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-section bb) above, with the relevant cutoff date being the date of publication of the buyback offer with the granting of tender rights, and adjusted if necessary also in accordance with the provisions of the sub-section above, with the relevant cutoff date being the date of publication of the adjustment. The Company's Management Board will determine the further details of the tender rights, in particular their conditions, term and, where appropriate, tradability.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to grant, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, in the event treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders subscription rights for shares to the bearers of bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or any subordinated Group company in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligations.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to sell, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders if the shares are sold for cash at a price that is not substantially below the stock exchange price of the Company's shares at the time of sale. The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded in this context. However, this authorization is subject to the condition that the shares sold with subscription rights excluded pursuant to section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG must not exceed in aggregate 10% of the capital stock either at the time the authorization becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the authorization is exercised. This limit of 10% of the capital stock includes those shares that are issued during the term of this authorization until the sale of treasury shares from authorized capital with subscription rights excluded pursuant to section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG. This limit of 10% of the capital stock also includes those shares that are issued or are to be issued in order to service warrant and/or conversion rights and/or conversion obligations provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded.\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized to use, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares for the following purposes, in addition to a sale via the stock exchange or a use in another manner that complies with the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders:\n\n- As (partial) consideration in connection with the acquisition of companies or interests in companies or parts of companies or in connection with business combinations.\n- To float shares of the Company on foreign stock exchanges on which they were previously not admitted to trading. The price at which these shares are floated on foreign stock exchanges (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) must not be more than 5% below the arithmetic mean of the prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the closing auctions of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the day of their flotation on the foreign stock exchange.\n- To grant shares of the Company to current and former members of the Management Board and employees of the Company as well as to current and former members of the management boards or, as the case may be, boards of directors and employees of affiliates of the Company within the meaning of sections 15 et seqq. AktG in fulfillment of claims under virtual share participation programs. To the extent members of the Company's Management Board are to be granted shares, the Company's Supervisory Board decides thereon.\n\nShareholders' statutory subscription rights with regard to these treasury shares will be excluded in accordance with sections 71 (1) no. 8 and 186 (3) and (4) AktG to the extent that these shares are used pursuant to the above authorizations. Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for fractional shares if treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe authorizations to exclude subscription rights are in aggregate limited to an amount of up 10% of the capital stock existing at the time these authorizations become effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the resolution to sell treasury shares is adopted. This maximum amount of 10% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nconversion and/ or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds issued during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of the capital stock attributable to shares issued from authorized capital during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to redeem, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares without any further resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting being required either for the redemption or the implementation thereof. The redemption may also be implemented in accordance with section 237 (3) no. 3 AktG without a capital reduction and in such a manner that, as a result of the redemption, the proportionate share of the Company's remaining no-par value shares in the capital stock is increased in accordance with section 8 (3) AktG. In accordance with section 237 (3) no. 3, 2nd half-sentence AktG, the Management Board is authorized to amend the number of shares specified in the Articles of Association accordingly. The redemption may also be implemented in combination with a capital reduction, in which case the Management Board is authorized to reduce the capital stock by the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to the redeemed shares. The Supervisory Board is authorized to amend the number of shares and the capital stock amount specified in the Articles of Association.\n\nThe foregoing authorizations are granted for the period beginning September 1, 2023. They may be exercised once or several times, in their entirety or partially, individually or collectively. They also cover the use of treasury shares that have been acquired on the basis of previous authorizations to acquire treasury shares and treasury shares that have been acquired in accordance with section 71d sentence 5 AktG or (i) by any company controlled or majority-owned by the Company or (ii) by third parties acting for the account of the Company or of any company controlled or majority-owned by the Company.\n\n# Material agreements conditional to a change of control following a takeover bid\n\nA bank consortium has granted United Internet AG a syndicated loan facility of € 810 million until January 2025. In fiscal 2020, the Company exercised a contractually agreed extension option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated credit facility entered into on December 21, 2018 for the period January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690 million was agreed for this extension period. € 150 million of the revolving syndicated credit facility had been drawn as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n The members of the consortium were granted the right to terminate their share of the syndicated loan facility or the syndicated loan if a third party or a group of third parties acting in concert acquired a majority of the shares in United Internet AG or held the majority of voting shares at an Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company. The right of termination is available to each member of the bank consortium individually within 30 days of the announcement of the change of control by the Company. However, this right of termination does not apply if the majority of shares or voting rights at an Annual Shareholders' Meeting are acquired by Mr. Ralph Dommermuth or his direct relatives.\n\nFurthermore, several promissory note loans of United Internet AG totaling € 1,162.0 million are outstanding at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n The lenders of the promissory notes were granted the right to terminate their share of the respective promissory note loans if a third party or a group of third parties acting in concert acquired a majority interest in United Internet AG. The right of termination is available to each lender \n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nindividually within 30 days of the announcement of the change of control by the Company. However, this right of termination does not apply if the majority of the shares are acquired by Mr. Ralph Dommermuth.\n\n# Compensation agreements in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid\n\nNo compensation agreements have been concluded with members of the Management Board or employees of the Company in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7. DECLARATION ON COMPANY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe disclosures made in chapter \"7. Declaration on Company Management\" are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as an audit of the disclosures contained in the Declaration on Company Management in accordance with section 317 (2) sentence 6 German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB) is limited to the fact that the information has been provided and the Corporate Governance Report in chapter 7 constitutes a \"non-management report-related disclosure\" which is not subject to a substantive audit.\n\n## Principles of corporate governance\n\nAs a German public company listed on the stock exchange, the management of United Internet AG is governed by the relevant statutory regulations and the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\").\n\nThe term Corporate Governance stands for responsible corporate management and control geared to sustainable value creation. Efficient cooperation between Management Board and Supervisory Board, respect for stockholder interests, openness and transparency of corporate communications are key aspects of good corporate governance.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG regard it as their duty to secure the Company's continued existence and sustainable value creation through responsible corporate governance focused on the long term. Appropriate consideration is given to environmental and social objectives.\n\nIn this declaration on company management, the Management Board and Supervisory Board report on the Company's corporate governance (Corporate Governance Report) in addition to the statutory requirements in accordance with section 289f HGB for the parent company and section 315d HGB for the Group also in accordance with Principle 23 of the Code. The Corporate Governance Report is based on the Code in its current version dated April 18, 2022, which was published in the Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022\n\n# Management and corporate structure\n\nIn accordance with its legal status, United Internet AG operates a dual management and monitoring structure comprising two corporate bodies: the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The third body is the Shareholders' Meeting. All three bodies are committed to serving the Company's interests.\n\n# Management Board\n\n## **Working procedures of the Management Board**\n\nThe Management Board is the body charged with managing the Group's operations. In the fiscal year 2023, it initially consisted of two persons (namely Mr. Ralph Dommermuth and Mr. Martin Mildner), and following the departure of Mr. Mildner on expiry of March 31, 2023, and the appointment of Mr. Ralf Hartings and Mr. Markus Huhn, each as of April 1, 2023, it consisted of three persons. For initial appointments, a term of office of three years is considered. The Supervisory Board assesses on a case\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nby-case basis as to which term of office within the legally permissible term of appointment appears appropriate. Beyond this, Management Board members are appointed for no longer than five years. The Management Board conducts operations in accordance with its legal and statutory obligations, as well as the rules of procedure adopted by the Supervisory Board, and the corresponding recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG.\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for preparing the Interim and Annual Financial Statements as well as for appointing key managers within the Company. In addition, it systematically defines the risks and opportunities for the Company associated with social and environmental factors, as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities, and subsequently assesses these. In addition to long-term economic objectives, the corporate strategy also takes appropriate account of environmental and social objectives. Corporate planning includes both the corresponding financial and sustainability-related targets. Further information on sustainability can be found on the Company's website at www.united-internet.de under Company/Sustainability.\n\nDecisions of fundamental importance require the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board in accordance with the statutory provisions of section 90 AktG and provides the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at least once a month with an oral overview – and at the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also in writing – of the current status of relevant reporting items pursuant to section 90a AktG. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is thus informed without delay by the Chairman or Speaker of the Management Board, or the Chief Financial Officer, about important events that are essential for assessing the Company's situation and development, as well as for the management of the Company. Important items also include any substantial deviation from the budget or other forecasts of the Company. The Chairman or Speaker of the Management Board, or Chief Financial Officer, shall also inform the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in advance where possible otherwise immediately thereafter, about all ad hoc announcements of the Company pursuant to Art. 17 MAR.\n\nThere is an age limit of 70 for members of the Management Board. This requirement is currently complied with in full.\n\nThe Management Board conducts the Company's business with joint responsibility and according to common objectives, plans, and policies. Irrespective of the joint responsibility of the Management Board, each member bears responsibility for his assigned division, but is required to subordinate the interests of his assigned division to the overall good of the Company.\n\nThe full Executive Board regulates the division of responsibilities in a business distribution plan.\n\nThe Management Board members inform each other about important events within their divisions. Matters of greater importance which are not approved in the budget must be discussed and decided by at least two Management Board members, whereby one of the two Management Board members must be responsible for the Finance division.\n\nIrrespective of their areas of responsibility, all Management Board members constantly monitor those events and data which are crucial for the Company's business development so they are always able to help avert potential disadvantages, or implement desirable improvements and expedient changes by drawing them to the attention of the full Management Board.\n\nThe full Management Board resolves on all matters of particular importance and scope for the Company or its subsidiaries and investment companies.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nResolutions are adopted by the full Management Board with a simple majority. Should the vote result in a tie, the Chairman of the Management Board has a casting vote. The resolutions of the Management Board are recorded in the minutes.\n\nThe full Management Board meets regularly once a month and otherwise as required.\n\nEach Management Board member immediately discloses any conflict of interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Management Board or Speaker of the Management Board and informs the other Management Board members about it where necessary.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the members of the Management Board did not and do not currently hold any supervisory board mandates in other listed companies outside the Group or comparable functions and thus also do not chair the supervisory boards of such companies.\n\n## **Composition of the Management Board**\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Management Board members on December 31, 2023**\n\n- Ralph Dommermuth, Company founder and Chief Executive Officer (with the Company since 1988)\n- Ralf Hartings, Chief Financial Officer (Management Board member since April 1, 2023; with the United Internet Group since 2021)\n- Markus Huhn, Management Board member responsible for Shared Services / HR (Management Board member since April 1, 2023; with the United Internet Group since 1994)\n\n#### **Departed in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n Martin Mildner, Chief Financial Officer (Management Board member from October 1, 2020 to March 31, 2023)\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\n## **Working procedures of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting consisted of five members until May 16, 2023. Since May 17, 2023, the Supervisory Board has once again comprised six members (namely, Mr. Philipp von Bismarck, Dr. Manuel Cubero del Castillo-Olivares, Mr. Stefan Rasch, Prof. Dr. Andreas Söffing, and Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei-Yee Weiß, as well as – since May 2023 – Prof. Dr. Franca Ruhwedel). The members of the Supervisory Board are generally elected for a period of five years.\n\nIn accordance with German law, the Company's articles, its rules of procedure, and the corresponding recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG – the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the Management Board and monitors and advises it with\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nregard to the management of business, and the Company's risk and opportunity management system. This mainly comprises questions relating to the topic of sustainability.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at regular intervals to discuss with the Management Board all matters of relevance to the Company regarding strategy and its implementation, as well as planning, the development of business, the risk position, risk management, and compliance. Together with the Management Board, it discusses the quarterly statements and half-year reports before publication and approves the annual budgets. These includes detailed sales, cost and earnings budgets as well as liquidity and annual investment budgets. The Supervisory Board examines the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company and the Group and adopts them if it has no reservations. In doing so, it also takes the reports of the Company's external auditors into account.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's responsibilities also include appointing members of the Management Board, as well as determining and regularly monitoring their remuneration in compliance with the latest legal regulations and recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG.\n\nWhen appointing members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board strives to achieve the best possible, diverse and mutually complementary composition for the Company and pays attention to longterm succession planning. Experience and industry knowledge as well as professional and personal qualifications play a particularly important role.\n\nAs part of its long-term succession planning, the Supervisory Board, with the involvement of the Management Board, regularly discusses highly skilled executives who could be considered as potential candidates for Management Board positions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board conducts regular tests to assess the efficiency of the Supervisory Board as a whole, as well as the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee. In accordance with Recommendation D.12 of the Code, the Supervisory Board and its committee assess how effectively they each perform their duties as a body. For this purpose, a self-assessment by means of questionnaires is conducted every two years or so.\n\nAt its meeting on December 11, 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee of United Internet AG conducted a self-assessment for the fiscal year 2023 in the presence of all committee members and the Audit Committee Chairman. The self-assessment was carried out on the basis of a comprehensive catalog of questions, which included in particular an assessment of the working methods and activities, as well as the size and structure of the Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, an assessment was made of the work with the auditor and interaction with the Management Board and the Group's departments.\n\nThe last self-assessment of the Supervisory Board was conducted and evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2022. The self-assessment was carried out on the basis of a comprehensive catalog of questions, focusing in particular on expectations, time commitment, composition of the Supervisory Board, independence of the Supervisory Board and how it deals with conflicts of interest, Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, and accounting matters.\n\nThe results of the self-assessments confirm that there is a good and open exchange within the bodies, as well as a trusting and cooperative working relationship with the auditor, the Management Board and the Company's departments. This professional cooperation is reflected, for example, in the receipt of well-prepared documents/information, which are always provided appropriately and on time. Specific suggestions are addressed and implemented during the year as part of the work of the Supervisory Board and Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing a thorough evaluation, it can therefore be assumed that the activities of the Supervisory Board and its Audit and Risk Committee are performed efficiently.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board complete the training and further education measures required for their tasks on their own, but receive appropriate support in this context from the Company. The measures conducted are detailed in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is convened at least twice every half of a calendar year. Supervisory Board meetings are convened in writing by its Chairman at least 14 days in advance. Further and more detailed information on the exact number of meetings and the topics discussed at these meetings can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company.\n\nWhen Supervisory Board meetings are convened, the Supervisory Board members are informed of the agenda items. If an agenda item has not been properly announced, a resolution concerning it may only be adopted if no Supervisory Board member objects prior to the vote.\n\nResolutions of the Supervisory Board are generally adopted at meetings held with physical attendance. However, it is permissible for meetings of the Supervisory Board to be held in the form of a video or telephone conference call or for individual members of the Supervisory Board to be connected by video or telephone call and, in such cases, for resolutions to be adopted or votes to be cast by video or telephone conference call. Meetings are chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. If so arranged by the Chairman, resolutions may also be adopted outside of meetings by other means, for example by phone or e-mail, if no member objects to this procedure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has a quorum if all members have been officially invited and at least three members participate in the resolution. A member shall also be deemed to participate in a resolution if he abstains from voting.\n\nUnless the law prescribes otherwise, resolutions of the Supervisory Board are adopted with a simple majority.\n\nMinutes are kept of the Supervisory Board's discussions and resolutions.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board is authorized to submit on behalf of the Supervisory Board the declarations of intent required for the implementation of the Supervisory Board's resolutions.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee assists the Supervisory Board in its monitoring of accounting practices and the integrity of the accounting process, as well as in monitoring the effectiveness and functionality of the internal control system, the risk management system, the compliance management system, and the internal auditing system. Moreover, it supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the auditing of the financial statements, the services provided by the auditor, the auditing fees, and the additional services provided by the auditor.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee closely examines the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, the Combined Management Report for the Company and the Group, the nonfinancial statement and the non-financial Group statement, and the Management Board's proposal for the allocation of unappropriated profit. It discusses with the Management Board and the auditors the audit reports, the audit process, the audit focus areas and methodology, as well as the audit results, also with regard to the internal control system relating to the accounting process, and makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board. It regularly assesses the quality of the audit. Prior to their publication, it discusses the quarterly statements and the half-year financial report with the Management Board.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee prepares the negotiations and resolutions of the Supervisory Board for the election proposal of the auditor to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and decisions on corporate governance issues, as well as resolving on the approval of related party transactions in accordance with section 111b (1) AktG. There were no such transactions requiring approval in the reporting period.\n\nThe Audit Committee discusses with the auditor the assessment of the audit risk, the audit strategy and audit planning, and the audit results. The Chairman or Chairwoman of the Audit Committee regularly discusses current issues relating to the audit and its progress with the auditor, also in the presence of all members of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Audit Committee also consults regularly with the auditor without the presence of the Management Board. A total of eight consultation meetings were held with the auditor in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman or Chairwoman of the Audit Committee regularly reports to the Supervisory Board on the activities of the Audit and Risk Committee. In the event of significant occurrences and findings by the Audit and Risk Committee, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is immediately informed.\n\n## **Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board / status of implementation**\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board aims to achieve a composition of the Supervisory Board that enables qualified advice and supervision for the Company's Management Board.\n\nIn view of\n\n- the size of the Supervisory Board,\n- the business in which the Company operates,\n- the size and structure of the Company,\n- the scope of the Company's international activities, and\n- its current shareholder structure,\n\nthe Company's Supervisory Board has adopted the following targets for its future composition. These take into account the statutory requirements both with regard to the requirements placed on individual Supervisory Board members and with regard to the composition of the entire Supervisory Board and – unless expressly stated otherwise – the recommendations of the Code. In particular, a skills profile has been prepared with regard to the overall body.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will take these targets into account when making proposals to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting regarding the election of Supervisory Board members and ensure that the respective candidates meet the requirements for fulfilling the skills profile for the overall body. In doing so, the specific situation of the Company must be taken into consideration.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Requirements for individual members**\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board aims to ensure that each Supervisory Board member meets the following requirements:\n\n#### **General requirement profile**\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board should have the requisite knowledge and experience to enable them to carefully monitor and advise the Company's Management Board and to assess any risks for the Company's business. Moreover, the Supervisory Board will ensure that all its members have a personal profile that enables them to maintain the Company's public reputation.\n\n#### **Time availability**\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board must have sufficient time to exercise their duties with due care throughout the entire period of office. In particular, the members of the Supervisory Board must observe the legal requirements and should follow the Code's recommendations regarding the permissible number of Supervisory Board mandates.\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nSupervisory Board members should not engage in any other activities likely to cause frequent conflicts of interest. These include board positions or consultancy work for key competitors, as well as personal relationships with them.\n\n#### **Age limit for Supervisory Board members**\n\nAs a rule, members of the Supervisory Board should not have reached the age of 70 at the time of their election or re-election.\n\n## **Requirements regarding the composition of the Supervisory Board as a whole**\n\nIn addition to the individual requirements for Supervisory Board members, the Company's Supervisory Board also strives to reach the following targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board as a whole in line with recommendation C.1 of the Code.\n\n#### **Skills profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole**\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must collectively have the knowledge, skills, and professional experience necessary for them to carry out their tasks as required. The Supervisory Board strives to ensure that the Supervisory Board as a whole covers the widest possible range of knowledge and experience relevant to the Company, and in particular meets the following requirements:\n\n- In-depth knowledge and experience of the telecommunications and internet sector;\n- Expertise or experience from other sectors of the economy;\n- Entrepreneurial or operational experience;\n- At least one member with several years of experience working abroad or working for a company with international activities;\n- At least one member with special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control processes;\n- Expertise in sustainability issues of significance for the Company;\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n- At least one member with expertise in the field of accounting, whereby the expertise in the field of accounting must consist of special knowledge and experience in the use of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems and must also apply to sustainability reporting;\n- At least one additional member with expertise in the field of auditing, whereby the expertise in the field of auditing must consist of special knowledge and experience in the field of auditing and must also apply to the auditing of sustainability reporting;\n- Knowledge and experience of strategy development and implementation;\n- In-depth knowledge and experience of controlling and risk management;\n- Knowledge and experience of HR planning and management;\n- In-depth knowledge and experience in the field of governance and compliance;\n- Expertise in the needs of capital market-oriented companies.\n\n#### **Diversity**\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the Supervisory Board is composed of a wide variety of members so that the Supervisory Board as a whole has sufficient diversity of opinion and knowledge. In its nominations, the Supervisory Board will take into account the diversity concept established by the Company, which is presented in a separate section below.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims to ensure that – what it believes to be – an appropriate number of at least four of its six members are also independent within the meaning of the criteria set out in the recommendations of the Code.\n\nThe Supervisory Board once again addressed the above objectives for its composition during the reporting year. In particular, it discussed them with regard to the skills profile for the full Supervisory Board. It also adhered to them and further expanded them. The Supervisory Board strives to fulfill the skills profile it developed for the Supervisory Board as a whole.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Composition of the Supervisory Board/implementation status**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Supervisory Board members as at December 31,

In doing so, the specific situation of the Company is to be taken into consideration.\n\nSubject to the formation of short fiscal years, the current term of office of the Supervisory Board members ends on expiry of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the year 2025.\n\n# Targets for the share of women on the Supervisory Board, Management Board, and in management positions / implementation status\n\nAs a listed company, United Internet AG is subject to the following obligations in particular of the German Stock Corporation Law (AktG):\n\n- Setting of targets by the Supervisory Board for the share of women on the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG (section 111 (5) AktG).\n- Setting of targets by the Supervisory Board for the share of women on the Management Board of United Internet AG (section 111 (5) AktG).\n- Setting of targets by the Management Board for the share of women on the first and second management levels below the Management Board of United Internet AG (section 76 (4) AktG).\n\nThe following targets are to be set for a period of no more than five years.\n\nAfter careful examination, the Supervisory Board and Management Board of United Internet AG adopted the following:\n\n- The Supervisory Board set the deadline for the attainment of the current targets for the share of women on the Supervisory Board and Management Board as the expiry of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2025 that decides on the discharge of the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2024.\n- After a target of \"0\" had previously been set for the Supervisory Board, a target of 30% was set for the share of women. The Supervisory Board currently comprises two women and four men.\n- A target of \"0\" was set for the Management Board. The Management Board was composed exclusively of two (at times three) men in the fiscal year 2023. After extensive and careful consideration, the Supervisory Board decided, based on the Company's interest in a steady continuation of the successful work of the Management Board's experienced members who are already familiar with the Group's structures, to set an unchanged target for the Management Board (now comprising three members) of “0”. At the same time, it was decided that in the event of a further increase in the size of the Management Board, the target for the proportion of women would be set at 25%.\n- Irrespective of this, the selection shall always be made according to the individual skills profile of the potential board members, whereby the Supervisory Board shall endeavor to give preference to women in the case of equal qualifications.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n- No target has been set for the share of women on the first and second management levels below the Management Board, as United Internet AG does not have any management levels below the Management Board due to its holding structure.\n- With regard to the share of women on the Supervisory Board and Management Board, the Supervisory Board reserves the right to resolve again on the target should there be any indication of a new appointment.\n\nThe current targets for the Supervisory Board and Management Board are therefore met at present.\n\n# Diversity concept\n\nDiversity aspects are always taken into account in the composition of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Company considers diversity to be not only desirable, but also crucial to the success of the Company. The Company therefore pursues an appreciative corporate culture in which individual diversity in terms of culture, nationality, gender, age group, educational or professional background, and religion is desired and equal opportunities – irrespective of age, disability, ethnic and cultural origin, gender, religion and ideology, or sexual identity – are promoted.\n\nThe Company aims to ensure that the Management Board and Supervisory Board are composed of many different types of people and that the bodies as a whole have a sufficiently wide variety of opinions and knowledge.\n\nIn particular, the following criteria should be taken into account:\n\n- The members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board should complement each other within their respective committees with regard to their experience, education, and professional background in order to develop a good understanding of the current status and the longer term opportunities and risks associated with the Company's business activities.\n- With regard to the gender quota, the Management Board and Supervisory Board have each set a target figure for the reference period until the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2025, which will decide on the discharge of the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2024. The Supervisory Board currently consists of two women and four men and the Management Board comprises three men. In principle, both genders should be treated equally according to their qualifications.\n- With the exception of the age limit of 70, as stipulated in B.5 and C.2 of the Code, no differentiation is made according to age for the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, and the sole differentiation should be according to the required knowledge and experience.\n- In view of the current size of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, consisting of just three and six members respectively, no targets have been set with regard to geographical origin. In order to ensure international experience, the Supervisory Board already stipulates that at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have several years of experience abroad or have gained operational experience with an internationally active company.\n\nIndividual strengths – in other words, everything that makes individual employees unique and distinctive within the Company – made it possible for the Company to become what it is today. A workforce comprising a wide variety of personalities offers the best possible conditions for creativity and productivity - and thus also for employee satisfaction. The resulting potential for ideas and innovation strengthens the Company's competitiveness and increases its opportunities in future markets. With this \n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nin mind, the aim is not only to find the field of activity and the function for each employee in which their individual potential and talents are best utilized, but also to ensure diversity in the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board – in the Company’s own interests – with regard to age, gender, and professional experience, for example.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has determined that the entirety of the relevant statutory and self-imposed provisions for its composition (targets for composition, skills profile, statutory target for the proportion of women, age limit, and the other provisions outlined above) should be regarded as a diversity concept within the meaning of section 289f (2) no. 6 HGB. The Company does not consider diversity targets that go beyond this with additional or more specific criteria to be appropriate. In view of the current size of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, more or more specific diversity aspects would create considerable difficulties to fill the positions taking into account all diversity criteria.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board believe that the diversity concept for the Management Board and Supervisory Board is currently fulfilled.\n\n# Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting is the body which formulates and expresses the interests of the shareholders of United Internet AG. At the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company and Consolidated Financial Statements are presented to the shareholders. The shareholders decide on the allocation of the unappropriated profit and vote on resolutions concerning other statutory topics, such as releasing the Management Board members from their responsibility for the past fiscal year and appointing external auditors. Each share entitles the owner to one vote. All shareholders who register in time and are listed in the Share Register on the day of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting are entitled to attend. Shareholders may also exercise their rights at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting by means of a proxy vote. The Company provides a proxy who votes according to the shareholder's instructions, providing he receives the required order.\n\n# Governance functions\n\nAt United Internet AG, governance functions are part of an integrated \"GRC\" organization which comprises the Corporate Governance, Corporate Risk Management & Internal Control Systems, and Corporate Compliance functions. The Group General Counsel, who reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of United Internet AG, is responsible for all GRC functions.\n\n# Internal Control System and Risk Management System\n\nTo secure the long-term corporate success of the United Internet Group, it is essential to effectively identify and analyze the risks involved in all business activities across the Group and to eliminate or limit them by means of suitable control measures. The Internal Control Management System and Risk Management System ensure that risks are handled responsibly. In particular, they are designed to identify, assess, manage, and monitor risks throughout the Group at an early stage. The systems are continuously refined and adapted to changing circumstances. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed by the Management Board about existing risks and how they are being dealt with, as well as about the effectiveness of the internal controls. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the Internal Control System and the Risk Management System were assessed by the Supervisory Board in its entirety. \n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main features of the Internal Control System and the Risk Management System with regard to the accounting process of the Company and the Group are described in detail in the Combined Management Report for the Company and the Group in accordance with sections 289 (4) and 315 (4) HGB. The Management Board also reports there in detail on existing risks and their development.\n\n# Compliance\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG has established a Group-wide risk-oriented Compliance Management System (UI-CMS) to ensure adherence to the legal and internal regulations. At the heart of this UI-CMS is a segment-based, decentralized Compliance Organization comprising segment compliance managers and corporate compliance managers.\n\nAt segment level, the segment compliance managers are responsible for the specific design of the a segment-based CMS. In certain business units, especially in significant subsidiaries of IONOS SE, the compliance organization is supported by local compliance managers and in certain departments, such as HR, by functional compliance managers.\n\nThe overarching objective of all compliance activities is to prevent compliance violations. This objective is achieved by taking appropriate measures in line with the United Internet Group's risk situation and in accordance with the three-level approach of \"Prevent\", \"Detect\", and \"Respond\". The main topics are the prevention of corruption, policy management, the establishment of confidential reporting channels and the protection of whistleblowers.\n\nThe main elements of the UI-CMS are described in detail in United Internet AG's Sustainability Report.\n\n# Financial disclosures / transparency\n\nIt is the declared aim of United Internet AG to inform institutional investors, private shareholders, financial analysts, employees, and the public simultaneously and with equal treatment about the Company's situation by means of regular, open, and up-to-date communication.\n\nTo this end, all important information, such as press releases, ad-hoc announcements, and other mandatory disclosures (e.g., directors' dealings and notifications of voting rights), as well as all financial reports, are published in accordance with statutory regulations. In addition, United Internet AG provides extensive information on its corporate website (www.united-internet.de), where documents and information on Annual Shareholders' Meetings and other economically relevant facts can be found.\n\nUnited Internet AG provides shareholders, analysts, and the press with four reports each fiscal year on the Company's business development and its financial and earnings position. The publication dates of these reports are stated in a binding financial calendar, which the Company posts on its website and regularly updates in accordance with legal obligations.\n\nThe Management Board also provides immediate information in the form of ad-hoc announcements about any events not known to the public which might significantly affect the share price.\n\nAs part of its investor relations activities, the Company's management team regularly meets with analysts and institutional investors. We also hold analyst conferences to announce our semi-annual and annual figures, which investors and analysts can also participate in via telephone.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Accounting and auditing\n\nThe United Internet Group's accounts are drawn up according to the principles of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS, as applicable in the EU) with consideration of section 315e HGB. However, the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company United Internet AG – relevant for all dividend and tax matters – are drawn up according to the rules of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Annual Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements are audited by independent auditors. The respective auditing company is selected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board issues the auditing mandate, determines auditing focal points, approves the auditing fee, and examines the independence of the auditors.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has audited the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG and the Group since the fiscal year 2022. Mr. Erik Hönig and Mr. Christian David Simon are the auditing partners responsible for the fiscal year 2023.\n\n# Remuneration of Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nRemuneration for members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board is presented in a detailed Remuneration Report for the fiscal year 2023 in accordance with section 162 AktG, together with the corresponding Auditor's Report, and is accessible to the public on the Company's website at www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html. The Annex to this Remuneration Report contains a detailed description of the current remuneration system in accordance with section 87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG as well as the most recent remuneration resolution adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with section 113 (3) AktG.\n\nInformation on Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration can also be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2023 under Note 42.\n\n# Declaration of conformity with regard to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG submitted their declaration of conformity (presented below) in accordance with section 161 AktG and immediately published it on the Company's website (www.united-internet.de), as well as in the Federal Gazette (\"Bundesanzeiger\").\n\nIn accordance with section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG declare that:\n\nUnited Internet AG has complied with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (\"Code\") as last revised on April 28, 2022, which became effective upon publication in the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022 and on which its last Declaration of Conformity issued on December 16, 2022\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nas well as the update of May 17, 2023 were based, with the stated exceptions detailed therein, and will continue to comply with the recommendations of the Code with the following exceptions:\n\n#### **Formation of a nomination committee (Recommendation D.5)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board does not form any other committees in addition to the Audit and Risk Committee, but performs all other tasks as a whole. The Supervisory Board considers this to be appropriate, as efficient plenary discussions and an intensive exchange of opinions are possible even with a six-member Supervisory Board. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board sees no need to establish a Nomination Committee.\n\n#### **Management Board remuneration - Remuneration system (Recommendations G.1 to G.5 inclusive of the Code)**\n\nTaking into account the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders' Rights Directive (\"ARUG II\") and the new German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\"), the Supervisory Board developed and agreed changes to the remuneration system for members of the Management Board.\n\nWith the recommendation to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in May 2021, the remuneration system became the basis for service agreements with Management Board members concluded in the future. The elaborated remuneration system takes into account the recommendations in G.1 to G.5 inclusive without any restrictions. The deviation from the recommendations in G1 to G5 inclusive is due exclusively to a service agreement still in effect at this time, but which has since been terminated.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Long-term variable remuneration (Recommendation G.10 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.10 of the Code, the variable remuneration components granted to members of the Management Board should be awarded primarily in the form of Company stock or on the basis thereof. Moreover, any such grants to members of the Management Board should be subject to a blackout period of four years. Share-based remuneration is awarded in the form of the Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) plan as a long-term remuneration program for the Management Board. The term of this plan totals six years. Within this period of six years, a Management Board member can exercise a portion (25%) of the SARs awarded at certain points in time — at the earliest, however, after two years. This means that a Management Board member can already obtain a part of the long-term variable remuneration after a period of two years. The total amount of SARs can only be fully exercised for the first time after a period of five years.\n\nOn May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting amended the previously valid remuneration system for members of the Company's Management Board. Accordingly, periods spent as a Management Board member of an affiliated company may be taken into account in full or in part when calculating the time limits.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is of the opinion that this system of long-term remuneration has proven its value and sees no reason to postpone any further the possibility of obtaining remuneration earned under the plan. The Supervisory Board believes that by linking the plan to the share price of United Internet AG and the Company's possibility to issue shares to satisfy entitlements from the plan, Management Board members already participate appropriately in the risks and opportunities of United Internet AG. Since the plan has been designed with a term of six years and the SARs awarded can only be exercised proportionately over this term and at the earliest after two years, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the plan is ideally suited to achieving the desired retention and incentive effect in the interest of United Internet AG and that no changes are required. The fact that service periods as a Management Board member of affiliated companies can now also be taken into account is intended to enable the promotion of Management Board members within the Group.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Retaining/reclaiming variable remuneration (Recommendation G.11 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.11 of the Code, the Supervisory Board shall have the possibility to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration in justified cases. A service agreement that already existed at the time the remuneration system was first approved but has since been terminated did not contain such a provision. This therefore constitutes a deviation from section G.11 of the Code. An obligation to agree a so-called claw-back clause for the reclaim of variable compensation has been included in the new remuneration system and was taken into account in the current service agreements of the Management Board members.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Remuneration system (Recommendations G.8, 9 and 12 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.8, 9 and 12 of the Code, agreed targets and target attainment, as well as regulations on maturity and holding periods, should not be changed retrospectively. In the context of the departure of a Management Board member, the Company deviated from this recommendation and is thus declaring this deviation.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Benefits on contract termination (Recommendation G.13 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.13 of the Code, any payments made to Management Board members due to early termination of their Management Board activity shall not exceed twice the annual remuneration and shall not constitute remuneration for more than the remaining term of the employment contract. If post-contractual non-compete clauses apply, such severance payments shall be taken into account in the calculation of any compensation payments. The current service agreements of Management Board members do not include an option to take this into account. This was included in the remuneration system and in future will be taken into account in new service agreements to be concluded with Management Board members (and any related termination agreements).\n\nThe Declaration is permanently available to the public on the Company's website at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/declaration-ofconformity/2023.html. All of the Company's Declarations of Conformity in accordance with section 161 AktG since 2008 are also publicly available there.\n\nMontabaur, March 20, 2024\n\nUnited Internet AG\n\nFor the Management Board For the Supervisory Board Ralph Dommermuth Philipp von Bismarck\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\nPhilipp von Bismarck\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 8. REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) transposed Directive (EU) 2017/828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2017 into national law. As a result, new statutory requirements for remuneration reporting were introduced for listed companies, which apply to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.\n\nThe \"new\" Remuneration Report has been removed from financial reporting to create a separate report. Significant disclosures which were previously required, in particular individualized reporting on Management Board compensation and the main features of the remuneration system, have been transferred from the (Group) Management Report to the new Remuneration Report in accordance with section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe remuneration system and disclosure of compensation for members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2023 pursuant to section 162 AktG can be found in the \"Remuneration Report 2023\", which is published on the corporate website at www.unitedinternet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html.\n\nDisclosures on Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration are also provided in note 42 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 9. DEPENDENT COMPANY REPORT\n\nIn compliance with section 312 (1) AktG, the Management Board declares that the Company received adequate compensation (quid pro quo) for all legal transactions listed in the report on relations with affiliated companies, in accordance with the circumstances known at the time when such transactions were made, and that the Company was not disadvantaged. In the reporting period, no measures were executed or omitted.\n\nMontabaur, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nR.J.J\n\nRalph Dommermuth Ralf Hartings Markus Huhn\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n144\n\n| BALANCE SHEET                                                             | 120                                                                               |     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| NET INCOME                                                                | 122                                                                               |     |\n| CASH FLOW                                                                 | 124                                                                               |     |\n| CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY                 | 126                                                                               |     |\n| NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF<br>DECEMBER 31, 2023 | 128                                                                               |     |\n| Basis of preparation and accounting policies                              | 128                                                                               |     |\n| 1.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATE-MENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n\n# 1. General information on the Company and accounting\n\nUnited Internet AG (hereinafter referred to as the \"United Internet Group\" or the \"Company\") is Europe's leading internet specialist with its business divisions Access (landline and mobile internet access products) and Applications (applications for using the internet), which are each divided into Business and Consumer segments.\n\nUnited Internet AG is domiciled in 56410 Montabaur, Elgendorfer Strasse 57, Germany and is registered there at the District Court under HR B 5762. The Group has numerous branches and subsidiaries in Germany and around the world.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of United Internet AG were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant supplementary regulations of section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB).\n\nThe reporting currency is euro (€). Amounts stated in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are in euro (€), thousand euro (€k) or million euro (€m). The Consolidated Financial Statements are always drawn up on the basis of historical costs. The exception to this rule are individual financial instruments which are stated at fair value.\n\nThe reporting date is December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2022 at its meeting on March 29, 2023. The Consolidated Financial Statements were published on March 30, 2023.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 were prepared by the Company's Management Board on March 19, 2024 and subsequently submitted to the Supervisory Board. The Consolidated Financial Statements will be presented to the Supervisory Board for approval on March 20, 2024. Theoretically, there may still be changes until the Consolidated Financial Statements are approved and released for publication by the Supervisory Board. However, the Management Board expects that the Consolidated Financial Statements will be approved in the present version. They are to be published on March 21, 2024.\n\n# 2. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nThis section first presents all accounting policies which have been applied consistently in the periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Following this, those accounting standards applied for the first time in these financial statements are explained, as are those accounting standards recently published but not yet applied.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2.1 Explanation of main accounting and measurement methods**\n\n## **Consolidation principles**\n\n \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG and of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries (majority shareholdings) controlled by it. Control exists when the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect those returns. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, it has all of the following characteristics:\n\n- Power over the investee (i.e., the Group has the ability to direct those activities of the investee that have a significant effect on the investee's returns based on existing rights\n- Exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee\n- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns\n\nGenerally, holding a majority of the voting rights is presumed to result in control. To support this presumption, and when the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights or similar rights in an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over the investee. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Contractual arrangements with the other vote holders of the investee\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- Voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group\n\nIf the facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the three elements of control have changed, the Group must reassess whether it controls an investee. A subsidiary is consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control over the subsidiary. Consolidation ends when the Group loses control over the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which the Group obtains control over the subsidiary until the date on which control ends. All intercompany assets and liabilities, equity, income, and expenses, as well as cash flows from business transactions conducted between Group companies are fully eliminated during consolidation.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\nIf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest, and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. This gain or loss is calculated as the difference between (i) the proceeds from the disposal of the subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests, and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary (insofar as a reclassification to the income statement is intended), and (ii) the carrying amount of the subsidiary's net assets to be disposed of.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the proportion of the result and net assets which is not attributable to the Group's shareholders. Non-controlling interests are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. They are disclosed in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of shareholders' equity but separate to the equity capital attributable to the shareholders of United Internet AG. For purchases of shares without a controlling influence (minority shareholding) or disposals of shares with a controlling influence but without loss of the controlling influence, the carrying amounts of shares with or without a controlling influence are adjusted to reflect the change in the respective shareholding. The amount by which compensation paid or received for the change in shareholding exceeds the carrying value of the respective share without a controlling influence is recognized directly in equity as a transaction with the shareholders.\n\n## **Investments in associated companies**\n\nInvestments in associated companies are valued according to the equity method. An associated company is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the associated company, but not to control or jointly steer the decision-making processes.\n\nIn the case of successive acquisition of company shares, the carrying amount is measured using the equity method as of the date on which the prerequisites for accounting as an associated company are met. United Internet measures the old shares in the case of successive share purchases according to the retrospective method (cost-based approach). The original purchase cost of the old shares is included as acquisition cost using the equity method. Any differences between the cost of the associate thus defined and the fair value of the previously recognized investment are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nUsing the equity method, investments in associated companies are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Company's share of the net assets of the associated company. Goodwill connected with an associated company is included in the carrying value of the investment and not subjected to scheduled amortization. The income statement includes the Company's portion of the success of the associated company. Changes recognized directly in the equity capital of the associated company are recognized by the Company in proportion to its shareholding and – where applicable – reported in \"Changes in shareholders' equity\". Profits and losses from transactions between the Company and the associated company are eliminated in proportion to the shareholding in the associated company.\n\nUpon loss of significant influence, a gain or loss from the disposal of the associated company is recognized in the amount of the difference between (i) the proceeds from the disposal of the shares, the fair value of the remaining shares, and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the associated company (insofar as a reclassification to profit and loss is provided for), and (ii) the carrying amount of the investment to be disposed of.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe annual financial statements of the associated company are generally prepared as to the same reporting date as those of the parent company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the methods in line with standard group-wide accounting and measurement methods.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group ascertains whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss for the Company's investments in associated companies. If there is objective evidence that an impairment has occurred, an impairment test is carried out in the same way as for goodwill. Objective evidence exists, for example, if an associate is experiencing significant financial difficulties, has committed breaches of contract, is highly likely to become insolvent, requires restructuring, or an active market for the net investment ceases to exist because of the financial difficulties of the associate. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an associate below cost also constitutes objective evidence of impairment. A significant decline is assumed if the decrease in the fair value of an associate at the end of the reporting period is more than 25% of cost. A prolonged decline is assumed if the decrease in the fair value over a period of at least 12 months is more than 10% of the acquisition cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount is less than the associate's total carrying amount. If the recoverable amount increases in future periods, the impairment loss is reversed accordingly.\n\n## **Disclosure of disposal gains and losses from the sale of investments**\n\nInsofar as they concern effects on the income statement, regular carrying amounts and valuations of investments in associated companies are disclosed in the financial result (see explanations on the financial result).\n\nGains from the sale of such investments are always disclosed under other operating income, losses under other operating expenses.\n\n## **Foreign currency translation**\n\n \n\n#### **Functional currency and presentation currency**\n\nThe items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of all Group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the companies operate (\"functional currency\"). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro; this is the functional and presentation currency of United Internet AG.\n\n#### **Transactions and balances**\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing when the transactions occurred. Currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are generally recognized in profit or loss. They are deferred in equity if they result from net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nCurrency gains and losses relating to borrowings are recognized as financial expenses in the income statement. All other currency gains and losses are disclosed net as other operating income/expenses in the income statement.\n\nNon-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates prevailing when fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried \n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nat fair value are disclosed as part of the gain or loss on fair value measurement. Translation differences from non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on fair value measurement, and translation differences from equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are disclosed in other comprehensive income.\n\n#### **Group companies**\n\nThe expenses, income, assets, and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- Assets and liabilities are translated for each balance sheet presented as of the respective balance sheet date\n- Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for each presentation of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of translation at the transaction rates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date), and\n- All resulting translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn consolidation, currency differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign operations and from borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments are recognized in other comprehensive income. If a foreign operation is sold or borrowings that form part of the net investment are repaid, the related currency differences are reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nGoodwill and amounts to adjust the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities from the acquisition of a foreign operation to fair value are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at closing rates.\n\n(in relation to 1 €)\n\n| Labels | Values        |\n|--------|---------------|\n|        | Closing rate  |\n|        | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|        | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|        | Average rat   |\n|        | 2023          |\n\nThe exchange rates of major currencies developed as follows:\n\n| (in relation to 1 €) | Closing rate  |               | Average rate |       |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n|                      | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | 2023         | 2022  |\n| US dollar            | 1.108         | 1.068         | 1.081        | 1.052 |\n| UK pound             | 0.869         | 0.887         | 0.870        | 0.852 |\n\n## **Revenue recognition**\n\n#### **Revenue from contracts with customers**\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is accounted for using the following five steps:\n\n- Identification of the contract or contracts with a customer\n- Identification of distinct performance obligations in the contract\n- Determination of the transaction price\n- Allocation of transaction price to the performance obligations\n- Revenue recognition on fulfillment of performance obligations\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue is recognized separately for each of the Group's different segments (see also explanations on segment reporting in Note 5).\n\nRevenues in the separate segments are recognized according to the following principles:\n\n#### **Consumer Access segment**\n\n \n\n> The Consumer Access segment mainly comprises landline-based and mobile-based internet access products. The range comprises \"Mobile Internet\" and \"Broadband\".\n\nIn these product lines, the Group generates revenue from the provision of the aforementioned access products, as well as from additional services such as internet and mobile telephony. The transaction price consists of fixed monthly basic fees, as well as variable additional usage fees for certain services (e.g., for foreign calls and mobile phone connections not covered by any flat-rate), and proceeds from the sale of the respective hardware.\n\nRevenue recognition is based on a separation of the transaction price for the customer contract on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of the individual performance obligations. The United Internet Group generally offers comparable tariffs both with and without hardware. In these cases, the standalone selling price for the service component is therefore based on the tariff conditions of a service tariff without hardware. By contrast, the standalone selling prices for hardware are determined on the basis of the adjusted market assessment approach, as only a very small amount of the relevant hardware is sold to customers without a mobile contract. In this connection, the Group primarily uses hardware prices determined and regularly provided by a third-party provider and links these to the contractual terms and conditions specified when the contract is concluded.\n\nThe resulting revenue share allocated to hardware is recognized on delivery to the customer (timerelated revenue recognition). It usually exceeds the fee invoiced to the customer and then results in the recognition of a contract asset. This contract asset value is reduced by the customer's payments over the contract period. The revenue share allocated to the service component is recognized over the minimum term of the customer contract (period-related revenue recognition).\n\nIf the one-off fees invoiced to the customer on conclusion of the contract, such as activation fees, do not represent a material right (e.g., favorable renewal option), these are not recognized as a separate performance obligation but are allocated to the identified performance obligations as part of the transaction price and recognized in accordance with their performance. If the customer is granted material rights in the form of options to use additional goods or services, these represent an additional performance obligation to which part of the transaction price is allocated, taking into account the expected utilization. The corresponding revenue is recognized when these future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires. If one-off fees qualify as a favorable renewal option, revenue is recognized over the expected duration of the customer contract.\n\nThe United Internet Group grants its customers time-limited promotion discounts at the time of contract conclusion. These discounts are included in the calculation of the transaction price and are allocated to the performance obligations by means of an allocation mechanism.\n\nWithin the context of the 1&1 Principle, United Internet grants its customers a voluntary 30-day right of cancellation. If customers make use of the 1&1 Principle and cancel their contracts, they have the right to be reimbursed for individual transaction components, such as one-off fees and basic fees which have been invoiced. Any usage fees are excluded from the reimbursement claim. In return, United Internet has the right to demand the return of any hardware supplied. No revenue is recog\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nnized for expected customer cancellations. The payments received from the customer and to be reimbursed are carried as reimbursement liabilities and the claims for reimbursement resulting from the 1&1 Principle for delivered hardware are disclosed as non-financial assets.\n\nIn determining the transaction price, United Internet reviewed the materiality of a financing component. An analysis of current customer contracts determined that the financing components are not to be considered material. However, a change in the assumed interest rates or tariffs could lead to a significant financing component in the future. The financing effect is therefore reviewed for materiality at regular intervals.\n\n1&1 applies the portfolio approach as permitted by IFRS 15.4 for a part of its stock of contracts. In this case, customer contracts of the same kind are pooled and average values taken for certain valuation-relevant parameters, in particular transaction prices, standalone selling prices, and amortization periods.\n\nIt can be reasonably assumed that whether a portfolio or the individual contracts or performance obligations within this portfolio are assessed, it will have no material impact on the annual financial statements.\n\n#### **Business Access segment**\n\nThe Business Access segment comprises revenue from various standardized and customized telecommunications products for business and wholesale customers. In addition to the provision of traditional landline connections, the telecommunications services also include broadband services, network solutions as telecommunications infrastructure (leased lines) or VPN, added-value services, interconnection, IP services, and cloud solutions.\n\nIn the case of products that do not meet the definition of a finance lease pursuant to IAS 16, the transaction price consists of fixed monthly basic fees and/or variable, additional per-minute usage fees for certain services (which are not covered by a flat rate) and, to an insignificant extent, revenue from the sale of related hardware. Revenue recognition is based on a separation of the transaction price for the customer contract on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of the individual performance obligations. The transaction price for the sale of hardware is based on standard market prices. The standalone selling price for the service component is based on the tariff conditions of a comparable service tariff without hardware.\n\nTemporary discounts or basic fee exemptions are also granted to a lesser extent at the beginning of the term. These discounts are included in the transaction price and allocated on a straight-line basis in the course of revenue recognition.\n\nCertain products are provided on a lease basis. If all material opportunities and risks from a lease are transferred to the lessee, the present value of the minimum lease payments from this economic sale is recognized as revenue on commencement of the lease; as part of the subsequent accounting of finance lease receivables, interest income is recognized in subsequent periods. Leased assets are derecognized through cost of sales. In addition to the monthly payments, the minimum lease payments include any customer activation fees payable at the beginning of the lease term.\n\nIn the case of operating leases, where the lessor retains the material opportunities and risks, the lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Activation fees for operating leases are deferred and amortized over the lease term.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Consumer Applications segment**\n\n \n\n> The Consumer Applications segment comprises United Internet's consumer application business – whether ad-financed or via fee-based subscriptions –as well as the sales platforms for fee-based partner products.\n\n> Besides Germany, the United Internet Group also operates in Austria and the USA in this segment.\n\nIn the field of ad-financed applications (generally free e-mail solutions from GMX and WEB.DE), the Group generates advertising income and e-commerce commission mainly via the WEB.DE, 1&1, GMX, and smartshopping portals. This business is based on the frequent use of free applications and the correspondingly high number of hits for the portals. In the field of online advertising, space is offered on the websites of portals. Revenues are generated depending on the placing of advertising and number of screenings or according to click rates. In its e-commerce business, the Group receives commissions for the sale of products or brokerage of customers. For these products, revenue is recognized at a specific point in time.\n\nIn the field of fee-based subscriptions for the WEB.DE, 1&1, GMX, and smartshopping portals, revenue is mainly generated from fixed monthly fees for the use of extended applications, as well as for administration and storage. Customers generally pay in advance for a contractually fixed time period for the services to be provided by the Company. Revenue is recognized pro rata over the period of service provision. The payments received in advance result in contractual liabilities which are reduced accordingly over the performance period.\n\nRevenues from partner products (affiliates) are recognized and measured according to the Group's intermediary function. A distinction is made as to whether the delivery or service provided to the end customer results in delivery revenue and the Group is thus acting on its own account (principal) or whether the Group's services are limited to brokerage or commission (agent). Acting as a principal is assumed if the Group controls the goods or services owed to the end customer before they are transferred to the customer. Acting as an agent is assumed if the Group's performance obligation is basically to broker the supply of goods and services of another company.\n\n#### **Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the Business Applications segment, a wide range of e-mail, hosting, cloud, and e-business applications are offered for freelancers, small and medium-sized businesses, and home users. These applications include domains, websites, and e-shops, Personal Information Management applications (email, to-do lists, appointments, addresses), group work, online storage, and office software. The Group also offers its customers performance-based advertising and sales opportunities via Sedo.\n\nIn this segment, the United Internet Group is active in Germany, as well as – in particular – France, the UK, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Italy, Canada, Mexico, and the USA. It is one of the leading companies in all the countries mentioned. The services are rendered by various subsidiaries of the United Internet Group in Germany and abroad.\n\nCustomers generally pay in advance for a contractually fixed time period for the services to be provided by the Company. The main service in the product group Domains consists of domain registration for the end customer with the respective registry. With regard to the time-related recognition of revenue from domain registration, the special regulations regarding licenses are applied. As in the case of domains, a right of use is granted to an intellectual property existing at the time the license is granted (static), revenue is recognized at a specific moment in time.\n\nProduct groups that contain domains as part of multiple-element arrangements primarily relate to web hosting products. The web hosting packages offered usually combine domain registrations with \n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nfurther services, such as storage capacity (Webspace) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The service Webspace concerns the provision of storage space on servers at the data centers of the United Internet Group. SaaS refers to the customer's use of software (e.g., to create websites) hosted on servers of the United Internet Group. Both the Webspace and SaaS services are performance obligations based on time periods, as the customer benefits continuously from the corresponding flow of benefits.\n\nCustomer contracts in the web hosting product category generally comprise several separate performance obligations, which are recognized both on a time-related basis (domain registration performance obligation) and a period-related basis (Webspace and SaaS performance obligation). The total fee for the customer contract is therefore allocated to the various performance obligations. In the absence of separate standalone selling prices for Webspace and SaaS, and a high degree of price variability, the residual method is used to allocate the total fee. The revenue share attributable to the period-related services is therefore determined on the basis of the total fee less the standalone selling price of the included domains.\n\nIn addition to application revenue, this segment also includes revenue from the performance-based advertising form of domain marketing.\n\nIn Domain Marketing, United Internet operates (via Sedo GmbH) a trading platform for the secondary domain market (domain trading). At the same time, the Group offers domain owners the possibility to market unused domains to advertisers (domain parking). In addition to these customer domains, the Group also holds its own portfolio of marketable and salable domains. In domain trading, the Group receives sales commission from the successful sale of domains via the platform and also generates revenue from services relating to domain value assessments and transfers. The sales commissions and services are generally based on a percentage of the sales price achieved, whereas fixed prices are generally charged for the other services. In domain parking, domains are mainly marketed using text links, i.e., links on the parked domains to offers of the advertisers (primarily via cooperation agreements with search engines). The Group receives performance-based payment on a monthly basis from the cooperation partner on a pay-per-click basis, according to the number of clicks registered by the cooperation partner.\n\nThe Group recognizes sales commissions as revenue when the service is rendered. Revenue is thus recognized on completion of the transaction or provision of the service. In the case of domain parking, the monthly payments credited by cooperation partners are recognized as revenue.\n\n## **Government grants**\n\nGovernment grants are recognized where there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and the Company will satisfy all attaching conditions. Where the grants relate to an expense item, they are recognized as income in scheduled amounts over the period necessary to match the grants to the costs they are intended to compensate. Grants relating to an asset item reduce the carrying value of that item.\n\n## **Electricity price brake**\n\nIn the current fiscal year, the Group made use of the support provided by the German Electricity Price Brake Act in order to respond to the rise in energy costs. In accordance with IAS 20.29, the receipt of the relief amount or subsidy was recognized in the income statement as a reduction of the corresponding primary expense. It should be noted that the final settlement of the utilization of the electricity\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nprice brake was still outstanding at the time of preparing the financial statements. The provisional amount of the utilization is in the lower million range.\n\n## **Financial income**\n\n \n\nInterest income is recognized as interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, i.e., the rate which discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income is recognized with the inception of the legal right to payment.\n\n## **Income taxes**\n\nThe tax expense for a period comprises current taxes and deferred taxes. Taxes are recognized in the income statement, unless they relate to transactions that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In these cases, taxes are recognized accordingly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent taxes are valued at the amount at which a refund from the tax authorities or a payment to the tax authorities is expected. The amount is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and tax laws applicable on the reporting date in those countries in which the Group operates and generates taxable income, or which will soon apply.\n\nThe liability method is used to create deferred taxes on all temporary differences existing on the reporting date between the carrying value of an asset or a liability in the balance sheet and the fiscal carrying value.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except\n\n- where the deferred tax liability from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the profit according to IFRS nor taxable profit or loss, and\n- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except\n\n- where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the profit or loss according to IFRS nor taxable profit or loss, and\n- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable income will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted as of the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n## **Sales tax**\n\nExpenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except for the following cases:\n\n- When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.\n- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## **Intangible assets**\n\nThe Group has control over an asset if it is able to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and can restrict the access of third parties to these benefits. Individually acquired intangible assets are carried at cost on initial recognition. The acquisition cost of intangible assets resulting from the business combination corresponds to its fair value at the time of acquisition. In the following periods, intangible assets are valued at cost less cumulative amortization and cumulative impairment charges.\n\nWith the exception of those development costs which can be capitalized, costs for internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the period incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs for a single project are only capitalized as intangible assets if the Group can demonstrate the following:\n\n- The completion of the intangible asset can be technically realized to the extent that it can be used or sold;\n- United Internet intends to complete the intangible asset and to use or sell it;\n- United Internet has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- The way in which the intangible asset is expected to generate future economic benefits; United Internet may demonstrate, for example, the existence of a market for the products of the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n Adequate technical, financial, and other resources are available so that the development can be completed and the intangible asset can be used or sold;\n\n \n\n United Internet has the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nA distinction is made between usable intangible assets with finite and indefinite useful lives and intangible assets which are not yet usable (spectrum licenses).\n\nIntangible assets with limited useful lives are amortized over their economic useful life and tested for possible impairment if there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. Intangible assets that are not yet usable are also tested for possible impairment. The impairment test is conducted in the same way as for goodwill. The useful lives and amortization methods of intangible assets with limited useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each fiscal year. Necessary changes to the depreciation method and useful life are treated as changes to assumptions.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets with limited useful lives are recognized in the income statement under the expense category corresponding to the function of the intangible asset in the Company.\n\nAmortization of capitalized development costs begins from the point in time at which the asset can be used. It is recognized over the period during which future benefits are expected and recognized in the expense category that reflects the function of the intangible asset. An impairment test is performed annually during the development phase.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as intangible assets not yet usable, are not amortized in scheduled amounts. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once annually at the end of the reporting period for the individual asset or on the level of the cash-generating unit. The impairment test is conducted in the same way as for goodwill. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to ascertain whether the assumption of an indefinite useful life is still justified. If this is not the case, a prospective change is made from indefinite useful life to limited useful life. Amortization of intangible assets which are not yet usable (spectrum licenses) will begin at the time of actual network operation.\n\nThe useful life periods can be found in the following summary:\n\n|                                        | Useful life in years |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Trademarks                             | Indefinite           |\n| Customer base                          | 4 to 25              |\n| Spectrum licenses                      | up to 19             |\n| Rights similar to concessions          | 5                    |\n| Other rights and licenses              | 2 to 15              |\n| Software                               | 2 to 5               |\n| Rights of use intangible assets        | 6                    |\n| Internally generated intangible assets | 3 to 5               |\n\nA review is also conducted on each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that a previously recognized impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased in size. In the case of such an indication, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is only reversed if there has been a change in the assumption used to determine the recoverable amount since recognition of the last impairment loss. If this is the case, the asset's carrying value is raised to its recoverable amount. This amount may not exceed the carrying amount, less depreciation, that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Property, plant and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is always carried at cost less cumulative scheduled depreciation.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are eliminated either on their disposal or when no further economic use is expected from the continued use or sale of the asset. Gains and losses from the disposal of an asset are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted where necessary.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their expected economic useful life using the straight-line method.\n\nThe useful life periods can be found in the following summary:\n\n|                                        | Useful life in years |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Leasehold improvements                 | up to 10             |\n| Buildings                              | 10 or 50             |\n| Vehicles                               | 5 to 6               |\n| Telecommunication equipment            | 7 to 10              |\n| Distribution grids                     | 25                   |\n| Other operational and office equipment | 3 to 19              |\n| Office furniture and fixtures          | 5 to 13              |\n| Servers                                | 3 to 5               |\n\nFor property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with company acquisitions, the applicable remaining useful life is determined primarily on the basis of the aforementioned useful lives and the useful lives elapsed at the time of acquisition.\n\nImpairment tests and the recognition of impairment losses or reversals are conducted in the same way as for intangible assets with limited useful lives (see below).\n\n## **Borrowing costs**\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless they are connected with the production or purchase of a qualifying asset. As in the previous year, there was no need to capitalize borrowing costs during the reporting period.\n\n## **Business combinations and goodwill**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. This involves the recognition of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operation at fair value.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe initial recognition of goodwill results from the excess of the acquisition cost of the entity over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Following initial recognition, goodwill is valued at amortized cost. Goodwill is subjected to an impairment test at least once annually or whenever there is any event or change in circumstances which might indicate impairment.\n\nIn order to test whether there is any impairment, goodwill acquired in the course of a business combination must be allocated from the date of acquisition to each of the cash-generating units of the Group which are to profit from the synergy effects of the combination. This does not depend on whether other assets and liabilities of the Group are already allocated to these cash-generating units.\n\nThe impairment need is determined by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill refers with their carrying value. The recoverable amount of an asset, or a cash-generating unit, is the higher of fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit less transaction costs and its value-in-use. In order to determine the value-in-use, expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market expectations regarding the interest effect and the specific risks of the asset. A suitable measurement model is used to determine fair value less sales costs. This is based on DCF models, valuation multipliers, the share prices of listed subsidiaries or other available indicators for fair value. If the carrying amount of an asset, or cashgenerating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset, or cash-generating unit, is regarded as impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill may not be reversed in the following reporting periods. The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## **Contract assets**\n\n \n\nA contract asset is the Group's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services it has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Every unconditional right to consideration is disclosed separately as a receivable. Contract assets are regularly assessed for impairment. The procedure is the same as for financial assets.\n\n## **Inventories**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value comprises the estimated sales proceeds, realizable in the ordinary course of business, less estimated necessary selling costs. Adequate allowances for excess inventories are made to provide for inventory risks.\n\nMeasurement is also based in part on time-related writedowns for inventories. Both the size and distribution over time of such writedowns represents a best-possible estimation of net realizable value and are thus subject to uncertainties. On indication of decreased net realizable value, inventories are corrected by recognizing suitable impairment charges.\n\n## **Contract initiation and contract fulfillment costs**\n\nAdditional costs incurred in initiating a contract with a customer (e.g., sales commissions) are capitalized if the Group expects to recover these costs.\n\nIn addition, the Group capitalizes the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer (e.g., customer activation fees and expected termination fees) if these costs are\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n- not within the scope of a standard other than IFRS 15 (e.g., IAS 2 Inventories, IAS 16 Property, Plant, and Equipment or IAS 38 Intangible Assets),\n- related to an existing or expected contract,\n- for the creation of resources or the improvement of resources of the Company that will be used in the future for the (continued) fulfillment of performance obligations, and\n- likely to lead to an expected settlement of the costs.\n\nCapitalized contract initiation and fulfillment costs are amortized over the estimated period of use. They are recognized in the balance sheet within deferred expenses. The amortization of contract initiation costs is disclosed in selling expenses and the amortization of contract fulfillment costs is disclosed in cost of sales.\n\nThe amortization periods for contract initiation costs are 1 to 5 years and for contract fulfillment costs 2 to 4 years.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the capitalized costs exceeds the remaining amount of the customer's expected consideration for the delivery of goods or the rendering of services less the costs still to be incurred.\n\n## **Classification as current and non-current**\n\nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities in the balance sheet as current and non-current assets and liabilities. An asset is classified as current if\n\n- the asset is expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle or the asset is held for sale or consumption within that period,\n- the asset is held primarily for the purpose of trading,\n- the asset is expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting date or\n- the asset is cash or a cash equivalent, unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for a period of at least twelve months after the reporting date.\n\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\n\nA liability is current if\n\n- it is expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle,\n- it is held primarily for the purpose of trading,\n- it is due to be settled within twelve months after the end of the reporting period or\n- the Group has no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\n## **Non-current assets held for sale**\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount \n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nand fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nThe criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the balance sheet.\n\n## **Leases**\n\n \n\nUnited Internet acts as both lessee and lessor. The majority of the Group's lessee contracts relate to the renting of network infrastructure, buildings, technical equipment and vehicles. In the case of buildings, various rental objects/leased items such as space (office space, computer center space, storage space or parking space etc.) may be listed as contractual objects (i.e., for rental by UI). The rented network infrastructure mainly comprises unlit fiber-optic cable (dark fiber), empty conduit systems, copper twin wires, leases of subscriber lines (local loops), and antenna locations.\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement contains a lease is based on the economic substance of the arrangement at the time of signing and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.\n\nA lease only exists if the lessee obtains control over the right of use. The lessee obtains control if they have the right to obtain substantially the entire economic benefit from the use of the identified asset and have sole control over the use of the asset.\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## **Group as lessee**\n\n#### Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancelable basic term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                | Useful life in years |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                      | 1 to 17              |\n| Network infrastructure         | 0.5 to 25            |\n| Intangible assets              | 6                    |\n| Operating and office equipment | 1 to 7               |\n\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n#### Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including de facto fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is used to measure right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of reference interest rates for a period of up to 17 years from risk-free interest rates with appropriate maturities, increased by credit risk premiums.\n\n#### Short-term leases, leases of low-value assets, and other policy choices\n\nThe standard includes exemptions from accounting according to IFRS 16 in the case of short-term leases (e.g., leases with a term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (e.g., PCs) for which right-of-use assets are not recognized. IFRS 16 is to be initially applied in fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2019. United Internet only has a small amount short-term leases, which are thus not capitalized according to IFRS 16 for reasons of materiality. In the case of leases of low-value assets – which only exist to a limited extent – the Group opts not to carry them according to IFRS 16 on a case-by-case basis. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low- value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThere is an option to form a portfolio of contracts with the same or similar characteristics. This option has been used for the asset classes subscriber lines (local loop) and main distribution frame locations (MDFs).\n\nThe option to recognize each lease component of a contract and all related non-lease components as a single lease component is applied for the asset classes underlying fiber-optic, MDFs, and cars, but not to lease arrangements for buildings.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Group as lessor**\n\n \n\nIn those cases where Group companies agree finance leases as the lessor, a receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The lease payments are apportioned between repayment of principal and finance income.\n\nIf the Group bears all substantial risks and rewards (operating lease), the leased asset is recognized in the balance sheet by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss by the lessor.\n\n## **Fair value measurement**\n\nIn some cases, assets and liabilities are measured either on initial recognition or during subsequent valuations at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- in the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n- in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nFair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses measurement techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- Level 1 quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 measurement techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable\n- Level 3 measurement techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics, and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## **Financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## **Financial assets – initial recognition and measurement**\n\nWith the exception of trade accounts receivable that do not contain a significant financing component or have a maturity of less than one year, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Trade accounts receivable that do not contain a significant financing component or have a maturity of less than one year are measured at the transaction price. In this context, reference is made to the accounting policies in the section Revenue Recognition – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that provide for delivery of the assets within a period determined by the rules or conventions of the respective market (standard market purchases) are recognized as of the trading date, i.e., the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\n## **Financial assets – subsequent measurement**\n\nFor subsequent measurement purposes, the classification of financial assets on initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and the Group's business model for managing financial assets. For subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories:\n\n- Financial assets (debt instruments) at amortized cost (ac)\n- Financial assets (equity instruments) at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (fvoci)\n- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl)\n\n## **Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)**\n\nThe Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and\n- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.\n\n## **Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments) with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition**\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income if they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established unless the dividends recover part of the cost of the financial asset. In this case, such gains are recognized in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\n## **Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss**\n\n \n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets must be classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are also classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. Debt instruments may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.\n\nA derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the host, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\n## **Financial assets – derecognition**\n\nA financial asset (or part of a financial asset, or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet) if one of the following conditions is met:\n\nThe rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'passthrough' arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\n\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income for financial assets measured at fair value in other comprehensive income are reclassified to cumulative profit or loss. In the case of a pro rata disposal, a pro rata transfer is made.\n\n## **Impairment of financial assets**\n\nFor trade accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified (one-step) method for calculating expected credit losses, whereby a loss allowance based on expected credit losses over the remaining term is recognized at each reporting date.\n\nExpectations of future credit losses are formed on the basis of regular reviews and measurements as part of credit monitoring. Historical data is regularly used to derive relationships between credit losses and various factors (e.g., payment agreement, overdue period, dunning level etc.). On the basis of these relationships, supplemented by current observations and forward-looking assumptions regarding the portfolio of receivables and contract assets held as of the reporting date, an estimate of future credit losses is made.\n\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt instruments which are not held at fair value through profit or loss and are not trade accounts receivable. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. Expected credit losses are recognized in two stages. For financial instruments for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized in the amount of the expected credit losses based on a default event within the next twelve months. For those financial instruments for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized in the amount of the credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default.\n\nThe Group's operating business is mainly in the mass customer business. Default risks are thus taken into account by means of individual value adjustments and lump-sum individual value adjustments. The specific bad debt allowances for overdue receivables are mainly based on the age structure of the receivables with different valuation discounts, which are mainly derived from the success rates of those collection agencies commissioned to collect overdue receivables. The age structure of receivables is shown in Note 19. All receivables that are more than 365 days overdue are written down individually by \n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n100%, unless there is objective evidence of successful recovery. Fully impaired trade accounts receivable are derecognized 180 days after collection has been handed over to the collection agency, unless the agency has given positive feedback or payment for an impaired receivable is unexpectedly received, or if the customer's inability to pay is known before or after transfer to the collection agencies.\n\nImpairment charges in connection with non-current loans to affiliates are recognized in the financial result.\n\nFurther details on the impairment of trade accounts receivable and contract assets are provided in the following Notes:\n\n- Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions (Note3)\n- Trade accounts receivable (Note 19)\n- Contract assets (Note 20)\n\n \n\nObjectives and methods of financial risk management (Note 43)\n\n## **Financial liabilities – initial recognition and measurement**\n\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, or as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## **Financial liabilities – subsequent measurement**\n\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification:\n\n- At Fair Value through Profit or Loss (fvtpl). This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group, as well as contingent purchase price liabilities in connection with company acquisitions. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading. Gains or losses on financial liabilities held for trading are recognized through profit or loss.\n- Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost (flac). After initial recognition, financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization using the effective interest method is included as part of finance costs in the income statement.\n\n## **Financial liabilities – derecognition**\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, canceled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the liability.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Offsetting of financial instruments**\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## **Financial instruments – derivative financial instruments and hedging relationships**\n\nThe Group occasionally uses derivative financial instruments in order to hedge against interest and exchange rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the date of the agreement and carried at fair value in the subsequent periods. The fair value of interest derivatives is calculated on the basis of present value models using market information (interest rate curves) as well as – where material – the individual credit risk of the Company. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative. Profit or loss resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhen entering into a hedging relationship to hedge against the risk of cash flow fluctuations, certain derivatives are allocated to underlying transactions which can be attributed to a risk connected with a recognized asset or liability or the risk connected with the intended transaction (cash flow hedge). The hedging instruments in a hedge are also carried at market values. However, changes in value relating to the effective portion are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve, a separate item under equity (\"Cash flow hedge reserve\"). Any ineffectiveness is recognized in profit or loss. Effectiveness is measured as at the end of the reporting period using the hypothetical derivative method. The amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the hedge influences the period result, e.g., when hedged financial income or expenses are recognized or when an expected sale is made.\n\n## **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances, other investments, checks and cash in hand, which all have a high degree of liquidity and maturities of less than 3 months – calculated from the date of purchase.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.\n\n## **Pensions and other post-employment benefits**\n\nPayments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are expensed on payment of salary to the employee.\n\n## **Contract liabilities**\n\nA contract liability is the Group's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration from the customer. If a customer provides consideration before the Group has transferred goods or services to the customer, a contractual liability is recognized at the\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\ntime of payment or at the latest at the time when the payment becomes due. Contractual liabilities are recognized as revenue as soon as the Group fulfills the contractual obligations.\n\n## **Accruals**\n\n \n\nAccruals are formed if the Group has a present legal or actual obligation resulting from a past event, and it is probable that the settlement of the obligation will give rise to the outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. No accruals are formed for future operating losses.\n\nAccruals are measured at present value based on management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the accrual due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.\n\nIf the Group expects at least partial compensation for a recognized accrual (e.g., in the case of an insurance policy), this compensation is recognized as a separate asset if the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense from forming the accrual is recognized in the income statement after deducting the reimbursement.\n\n## **Treasury shares**\n\nTreasury shares are deducted from shareholders' equity. The purchase, sale, issue or retirement of treasury shares is not recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe cancellation of treasury shares results in the pro rata reversal of the item \"Treasury shares\" disclosed in shareholders' equity at the expense of the remaining shareholders' equity. The Group uses the following application sequence:\n\n- The cancellation of treasury shares is always deducted from share capital in the amount of the par value.\n- The amount exceeding par value is first derecognized in the amount of the value contribution from employee stock ownership plans (SARs and convertible bonds) against capital reserves.\n- Any amount exceeding the value contribution from employee stock ownership plans is derecognized against accumulated profit.\n\n## **Share-based payment**\n\nGroup employees and Management Board members receive share-based payments as remuneration for their work in the form of equity instruments and the granting of stock appreciation rights, which for the majority of plans may be settled in cash or via equity instruments at the Company's discretion. As the United Internet Group has no current obligation to settle in cash for any agreement with such an option, all share-based payment transactions are carried in the balance sheet as equity-settled transactions.\n\nThe cost of such equity-settled agreements is measured using the fair value of such equity instruments on the date of granting. Fair value is measured using a suitable option price model; the Black-Scholes\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nmodel and Monte Carlo simulation are employed for this purpose. At each balance sheet date, the expected exercise volume is reassessed with a corresponding adjustment of the additional amount. Any necessary adjustment bookings are to be made in the period in which new information about the exercise volume becomes available. Expenses from the granting of equity-settled agreements are recognized over the period in which the related service is rendered (the so-called vesting period). This period ends on the date on which all vesting conditions (service and performance conditions) are fulfilled, i.e., the date on which the employee concerned has gained irrevocable entitlement. The cumulative expenses recognized on each reporting date until the vesting date reflect the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best-possible estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. A fluctuation probability of 0% is applied in each case. The income or expense recognized in personnel expenses for the period represents the development of cumulative expenses recognized at the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n\nWhen new equity instruments are granted as a result of the cancellation of previously granted equity instruments, IFRS 2.28(c) requires an entity to assess whether the newly granted equity instruments are a replacement for the previously granted or canceled instruments. For canceled equity instruments, the full outstanding expense is recognized immediately at the time of cancellation.\n\nIf they are classified as a replacement, the new equity instruments are accounted for in the same way as an amendment to the original instruments granted. New equity instruments that are not granted as a replacement for canceled equity instruments are accounted for as newly granted equity instruments. The benefits received are recognized at least at the fair value determined on the grant date (of the original instruments). If the amendments are beneficial to the employee, the additional fair value of the new equity instruments is measured and allocated over the vesting period as an additional expense. The additional fair value is measured as the difference between the fair value of the equity instruments identified as a replacement and the net fair value of the canceled equity instruments on the date on which the replacement instruments are granted.\n\n## **Earnings per share**\n\nUndiluted or basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the result attributable to the holders of registered shares by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated similarly to basic earnings per share with the exception that the average number of shares outstanding increases by the portion which would result if the exercisable subscription rights resulting from employee stock participation programs had been exercised.\n\n## **2.2 Summary of measurement principles**\n\nThe Group's measurement principles can be summarized and simplified as follows – providing there is no impairment:\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Balance sheet item                                   | Measurement

Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\n\nThe application of accounting and measurement methods in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make certain accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These have an effect on the disclosed amounts of earnings, expenditure, assets and liabilities, as well as contingent liabilities, as of the reporting date. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which may lead in future to significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities concerned.\n\n## **Judgments, estimates, and assumptions**\n\nIn the application of accounting and measurement methods, management made the following accounting judgments which significantly affect amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe most important forward-looking assumptions and other major sources of uncertainty as of the reporting date, which involve the risk of significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the coming fiscal year, are explained below.\n\n## **Impact of geopolitical crises**\n\n \n\nSociety, politics and the economy are currently facing complex macroeconomic challenges resulting from a combination of high interest rates, subdued growth expectations, a tense financing framework, falling trade growth and declining confidence among companies and consumers. In addition to the destabilizing effects of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East is also contributing to greater uncertainty about the economic future. The United Internet Group is responding to this by actively accepting the current challenges and integrating them into its business decisions, in particular by developing strategies to minimize risk, such as reducing the proportion of variable-interest debt or through diversified procurement strategies to ensure a secure and fair energy supply.\n\nAlthough the United Internet Group has no business activities in the countries involved in the wars, it is still confronted with the indirect effects. In view of the uncertain security situation caused by the war in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, especially surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, and the potential indirect effects on global business activities, United Internet has developed proactive risk management and mitigation strategies:\n\n- Cybersecurity risks: due to the increased cybersecurity threats associated with the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, the Company is stepping up its investment in cybersecurity measures. These include the use of advanced monitoring technologies, conducting regular security audits and training employees to improve their resistance to cyberattacks.\n- Hardware bottlenecks: the Company is adapting its logistics and procurement strategies in order to overcome potential hardware bottlenecks that could be caused by the uncertain security situation surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, exacerbated by the war in the Middle East. Among other things, this is being done by increasing the stock of hardware in order to cushion potential supply disruptions.\n\nThe Management Board and the operational managers will closely monitor further developments and initiate any appropriate countermeasures (if possible).\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnited Internet also takes account of developments in the economic environment in its accounting and reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements, e.g., when determining the recoverability of goodwill or the measurement of assets and liabilities.\n\nThese developments are not expected to have any significant direct impact on United Internet.\n\n## **Impact of climate change**\n\nEnvironmental and social concerns can impact the recoverability of Group assets in various ways. In particular, these risks include rising energy prices for renewable energies to operate our 5G mobile communications network. The recoverability of the 5G spectrum was reviewed as part of the impairment test (Note 29).\n\nThe Company currently assumes that any impact caused by environmental and social issues will not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Revenue recognition**\n\nThe standalone selling prices for hardware are determined on the basis of the adjusted market assessment approach, which requires an estimate of the relevant market prices for the respective hardware. Changes in these estimates may affect the allocation of the transaction price to the individual performance obligations and thus also affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n\nIn addition, various other assumptions and estimates are made during application of the portfolio approach, which are based on past experience and available knowledge at the end of the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions and estimates in their entirety can also have a material effect on the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n\nThe guiding principle for considering whether an entity is acting as a principal or as an agent is whether it has control over the specified good or service before transferring it to the customer. When examining the question of control, significant discretionary decisions often have to be made. This relates in particular to services in connection with the marketing of websites and the sale of third-party products and services by the Group. When a third party is involved in the performance process, the entity must determine whether the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide the specific good/service itself (i.e., the entity is a principal) or whether the performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of those goods/services by the third party (i.e., the entity is an agent). An entity determines for each specific good/service whether it acts as principal or agent. If the Group acts as an agent, sales are recognized on a net basis. If we act as principal, sales are reported gross.\n\n## **Costs of contract fulfillment and contract initiation**\n\nThe calculation of the estimated amortization periods for contract costs is based on past experience and subject to significant uncertainties, in particular with regard to unforeseen customer or technology developments. A change in the estimated amortization period affects the timing of the recognition. The carrying amount of capitalized contract initiation and contract fulfillment costs as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 303,145k (prior year: € 246,569k).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Impairment of non-financial assets**\n\n \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as not yet usable assets with finite useful lives, are assessed at least once a year or on indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable value of the respective cash-generating unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated is calculated either as \"value-in-use\" or fair value less cost of sell. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill was € 3,628,849k (prior year: € 3,623,435k).\n\nIn order to estimate value-in-use or fair value less cost of sell, management must estimate expected future cash flows of the asset or cash-generating unit and select a suitable discount rate to assess the present value of these cash flows.\n\nFurther details, including a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions, are presented in the Note \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\".\n\nThe most important management assumptions for the measurement of the recoverable value of cashgenerating units include assumptions regarding the development of sales, margins, and the discount rate.\n\n## **Carrying amounts and impairment test for investments in associated companies**\n\nAs of the reporting date, the United Internet Group holds investments in various associated companies. If the consideration for the acquisition of the shares is made by contributing a subsidiary or other investment, the acquisition costs of the associated company are to be determined by means of a company valuation. This valuation is closely related to the assumptions and estimates made by management with respect to the future development of the respective company and the applicable discount rate.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28.40, the Group examines on the reporting date whether the net investment of the United Internet Group in the respective associated company requires an additional impairment charge.\n\nThe carrying amount for shares in associated companies is measured on the basis of their prorated annual results. If the annual results for the fiscal year are not known, an estimate is made on the basis of the latest publicly available financial information of the respective associated company.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of non-listed companies consider both the available past experience for the respective company and expectations of its future development. As these expectations are based on numerous assumptions, the calculation of recoverable amounts depends on discretionary factors. The carrying value of investments in non-listed associated companies as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 373,205k (prior year: € 429,304k).\n\n## **Share-based payment**\n\nFor share-based payment arrangements, the cost of equity-settled arrangements is measured at the fair value of such equity instruments on the date of granting. In the case of share-based payment arrangements with cash settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement. A suitable measurement model must be used to estimate fair value when granting equity instruments; this depends on the contractual terms. Suitable data must also be chosen\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor the valuation process, including the expected option term, volatility, exercise behavior, and dividend yield, as well as the corresponding assumptions.\n\nIn the reporting period, expenses for share-based remuneration amounted to € 8,176k (prior year: € 12,427k).\n\n## **Taxes**\n\nUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.\n\nThe Group forms liabilities, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates. The amount of these liabilities is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective Group company's domicile. The carrying value of income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 87,996k (prior year: € 52,723k) and mainly related to current taxes of the fiscal year.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n## **Trade accounts receivable and contract assets**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are carried in the balance sheet less impairment charges made. Allowances for doubtful claims are made on the basis of expected credit losses by means of regular reviews as well as valuations conducted as part of credit monitoring. Assumptions concerning the payment behavior and creditworthiness of customers are subject to significant uncertainties. The carrying value of trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 545,935k (prior year: €460,228k). The carrying value of contract assets as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 882,733k (prior year: €865,085k).\n\n## **Inventories**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value comprises the estimated sales proceeds less the necessary expected costs up to the time of sale. Measurement is also based in part on writedowns for inventories. The size of such writedowns represents a best-possible estimation of net realizable value and is thus subject to uncertainties. The carrying amounts of inventories as of the reporting date amounted to € 178,083k (prior year: € 120,561k). Please refer to Note 21 for further details.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, and intangible assets are valued at cost on initial recognition. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with limited useful lives are depreciated over their expected economic useful lives using the straight-line method. Expected useful lives are based on historical experience and thus subject to significant uncertainties, especially with regard to unforeseen technological developments. When determining the timing of capitalization and the start of amortization for the 5G spectrum, discretionary decisions were made.\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with limited useful lives amounted to € 3,491,424k as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 3,306,074k). This amount includes spectrum licenses of € 1,028,921k (prior year: € 1,069,740k).\n\n## **Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities**\n\n \n\nFor the duration of the lease, a right-of-use asset in the amount of the present value of the future lease payments plus initial direct costs, advance payments, and restoration costs, and less incentive payments received is capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease. At the same time, a lease liability is recognized in the amount of the future lease payments less the interest portion.\n\nThe leases for the business premises in Montabaur and Karlsruhe contain extension options. In order to determine the terms of these leases, a period until 2033 was assumed due to their strategic importance for the Group – with the exception of two leases for buildings in Karlsruhe that were newly occupied in 2020 and have assumed terms until 2035. For leases of office buildings at the other locations, extension options are predominantly not included in the determination of the terms, as these assets could be replaced by the Group without significant cost.\n\nThe leases for antenna locations in connection with the 1&1 mobile communications network usually have a non-cancelable basic lease term of twenty years. Extension options are not included in the term, as it cannot be assumed with sufficient certainty that the extension options will be exercised at the time the lease is concluded.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is used to measure right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of reference interest rates for a period of up to 25 years from risk-free interest rates with appropriate maturities, plus credit risk premiums.\n\n## **Accounting for business combinations**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The initial recognition of goodwill results from the excess of the acquisition cost of the entity over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Costs accrued in the course of the business combination are recognized under other operating expense.\n\nHowever, assumptions made to determine the respective fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition are subject to significant uncertainties. For the identification of intangible assets, depending on the type of intangible asset and complexity of determining its fair value, the Company either uses independent appraisals of external assessors or fair value is determined internally using a suitable assessment technique for the respective intangible asset, generally based on a forecast of to\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\ntal expected future cash flow generation. These valuations are closely related to assumptions and estimates which management has made about the future development of the respective assets and the applicable discounted interest rate.\n\n## **Accruals**\n\nAccruals are formed if the Group has a legal or actual obligation resulting from a past event which will probably give rise to the outflow of resources with an economic benefit to fulfill the obligation, provided that the level of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties. The carrying value of accruals as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 95,099k (prior year: € 72,173k).\n\n# 4. Business combinations and investments\n\n## **4.1 Business combinations in the fiscal year**\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no business combinations in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n## **4.2 Business combinations**\n\n#### **IPO of IONOS**\n\nIn addition to the Group's operating business, there were further intensive preparations for the IPO of IONOS Group SE in early 2023. Concrete plans for the IONOS IPO were announced on January 17, 2023 as part of an \"intention to float\" (ITF) and the IPO was completed on February 8, 2023.\n\nThe shares of IONOS Group SE have since been listed on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) under ISIN: DE000A3E00M1, WKN: A3E00M, ticker symbol: IOS.\n\nUnited Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292m from the sale of shares, while the entire placement volume amounted to around € 389m.\n\nFollowing the IPO of IONOS Group SE, United Internet holds 63.8% and Warburg Pincus 21.2% of IONOS shares. 15.0% of shares are in free float.\n\n#### **Acquisition of shares in Street Media GmbH**\n\nOn September 5, 2023, the Group acquired 28.7% of shares in Street Media GmbH, based in Berlin, which has since been included in the consolidated financial statements as an associated company using the equity method.\n\nAn additional contribution of € 1,490k was made to the equity of Street Media GmbH on October 2, 2023, whereby the shareholding ratio did not change as a result of this transaction. The total acquisition costs for the share purchase amounted to € 1,567k. Street Media GmbH specializes in the development and management of digital media projects.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Explanations of items in the income statement\n\n# 5. Sales/segment reporting\n\n \n\nAccording to IFRS 8, the identification of operating segments to be included in the reporting process is based on the so-called management approach. External reporting should therefore be based on the Group's internal organization and management structure, as well as internal financial reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. In the United Internet Group, the Management Board is responsible for assessing and controlling the success of the various segments.\n\nThe Group's operating business is divided into the two business divisions \"Access\" and \"Applications\", which in turn are divided into the reporting segments \"Consumer Access\" and \"Business Access\", as well as \"Consumer Applications\" and \"Business Applications\".\n\nA description of the products and services is provided in Note 2.1 in the explanation of revenue recognition. The segment \"Corporate\" comprises mainly management holding functions.\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG mainly controls operations on the basis of key performance figures. It measures segment success primarily on the basis of sales revenue, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Transactions between segments are charged at market prices. Information on sales revenue is allocated to the country in which the company is domiciled. Segment earnings are reconciled with the total amount for the United Internet Group.\n\nIn the course of preparing the Interim Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023, the Management Board decided to make a significant adjustment to its internal reporting system. As a consequence, this change also led to a revision of segment reporting with a shift in focus from the previous \"controlling view\" to the \"accounting view\". This decision was intended to strengthen the harmonization of the Company's internal controlling and external reporting. The change resulted in reconciliation effects/shifts in key sales and earnings figures among the segments.\n\n- Reconciliation effects on sales: certain intercompany sales are no longer consolidated at segment level (as previously in the controlling view), but only at Group level (accounting view).\n- Reconciliation effects on EBITDA and EBIT: depreciation allocations and profit margins for intercompany services are no longer \"netted\" between segments (as was previously the case for internal service charging in the controlling view) but are disclosed (accounting view) – as if \"booked\" at segment level.\n\nOverall, the change has no effect on the Group's sales and earnings figures.\n\nBy making this change at segment level, United Internet is also taking account of the increasing independence of its segments (subgroups) and aligning segment reporting with the reporting of its listed and thus also reportable subgroups 1&1 AG (Consumer Access segment) and IONOS Group SE (Business Applications segment).\n\nSegment reporting of United Internet AG in fiscal year 2023 was as follows:\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                             | Segment<br>Consumer<br>Access | Segment<br>Business<br>Access | Segment<br>Consumer<br>Applications | Segment<br>Business<br>Applications | Corporate | Reconciliati<br>on/Consolid<br>ation | United<br>Internet<br>Group |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| January -

Revenue of the Business Access segment from contracts with customers for the fiscal year 2023 includes hardware sales of € 16,364k (prior year: € 7,625k). The remaining revenue of the two segments is attributable to service revenue. The other business segments only generate revenue from services.\n\nIn the reporting periods, there was no significant concentration of individual customers in the customer profile. As in the previous year, the United Internet Group did not generate more than 10% of total external sales revenue with any single customer. Foreign sales accounted for 10.6% (prior year: 10.6%) of total Group revenue.\n\nIn addition to investments, the highest management committee only monitors shares in associated companies, other non-current financial assets, and goodwill. The depreciation disclosed in the segments refers to other, non-monitored intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, as these are largely determined automatically once the relevant useful life has been determined.\n\nContract balances developed as follows in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n| in €k                               | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Trade accounts receivable (Note 19) | 543,696       | 460,228       |\n| Contract assets (Note 20)           | 882,733       | 865,085       |\n| Contract liabilities (Note 32)      | 207,691       | 188,383       |\n\nApart from customer growth, the main reason for the year-on-year increase in contract assets was the increased subsidizing of hardware in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, revenue of € 157,093k (prior year: € 157,886k) was recognized which was contained in contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\nThe total transaction price of performance obligations still unfulfilled at the end of the reporting period amounted to € 1,915,122k (prior year: € 1,670,738k) as of December 31, 2023. The following table shows the time bands in which the transaction prices from unfulfilled or partially unfulfilled performance obligations as of the reporting date are expected to be recognized:\n\n| in €k                 | Total     | 2024      | 2025    | >2025   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Consumer Access       | 1,553,503 | 1,140,640 | 412,862 | 0       |\n| Business Access       | 344,767   | 155,048   | 84,816  | 104,902 |\n| Consumer Applications | 9,651     | 8,406     | 1,246   | 0       |\n| Business Applications | 7,201     | 2,742     | 1,858   | 2,602   |\n| Total                 | 1,915,122 | 1,306,836 | 500,783 | 107,504 |\n\nThe transaction prices shown relate to unfulfilled performance obligations from contracts with customers with an original contract term of more than 12 months. They relate to service components with period-based revenue recognition and to contracts for which a one-off fee has been invoiced and which are now recognized as revenue over the relevant original minimum contract term.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.

For further details, please refer to Note 11.\n\nThe other cost of sales mainly include operating costs for the data centers and logistics expenses.\n\n# 7.

The rise in personnel expenses is due to the increase in headcount as well as higher salary adjustments. Personnel expenses in connection with employee stock ownership plans totaled € 8,176k (prior year: € 11,276k).\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of employees increased by 4.7%, from 10,474 employees in the previous year to 10,962 employees at year-end:\n\n|                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany                 | 8,981  | 8,550  |\n| Outside Germany         | 1,981  | 1,924  |\n| thereof the Philippines | 464    | 468    |\n| thereof Spain           | 446    | 422    |\n| thereof Poland          | 339    | 352    |\n| thereof UK              | 273    | 246    |\n| thereof Romania         | 261    | 242    |\n| thereof USA             | 118    | 120    |\n| thereof Austria         | 72     | 67     |\n| thereof France          | 8      | 7      |\n| Total                   | 10,962 | 10,474 |\n| thereof male            | 67%    | 68%    |\n| thereof female          | 33%    | 32%    |\n\nThe average number of employees in fiscal year 2023 amounted to 10,717 (prior year: 10,231), of which 8,755 (prior year: 8,356) were employed in Germany and 1,962 abroad (prior year: 1,875).\n\nWith regard to company pension plans, the Group only has defined contribution plans. The Company pays contributions to the state pension fund as a result of statutory obligations. There are no other benefit obligations for the Company after payment of the contributions. The current contribution payments are disclosed as an expense in the respective year. In fiscal year 2023, they totaled € 45,150k (prior year: € 41,623k) and mostly concerned contributions paid to the state pension fund in Germany.\n\nAs a result of contribution exemptions, an amount of € 0k (prior year: € 0k) of this total referred to contributions paid to related parties.\n\n# 13. Financial expenses\n\n \n\n| €k                                                      | 2023    | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Loans and overdraft facilities                          | 65,600  | 18,659 |\n| Subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives            | 47,918  | 30,096 |\n| Financing costs from leases                             | 21,347  | 11,907 |\n| Interest expense from deferral of frequency liabilities | 6,050   | 6,473  |\n| Interest expense from tax audit                         | 1,090   | 1,399  |\n| Other                                                   | 1,085   | 728    |\n| Total financial expenses                                | 143,091 | 69,262 |\n\nThe subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives relates to the measurement through profit or loss of the derivatives agreed in the course of the Warburg Pincus investment in the Business Applications segment, whose valuation depends in particular on the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. Expenses from subsequent valuation mainly relate to the decline in the fair value of these derivatives as at the end of the reporting period. The sharp decline in derivatives results from the decline in the valuation of the IONOS Group, which was based on its stock market price. This valuation is below the previously recognized enterprise value, which was determined on the basis of valuation reports.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe interest expense from the deferral of spectrum liabilities results from the agreement with the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Network Infrastructure under which the payment obligation for mobile communications spectrum was extended to 2030. Please refer to Note 34,3 for further details.\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 for an explanation of the financial expense from leases.\n\n## 14. Financial income\n\n| €k                                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives | 42,860 | 22,732 |\n| Interest Income from leases                  | 627    | 632    |\n| Income from loans to associated companies    | 467    | 328    |\n| Interest income from tax audit               | 417    | 5,452  |\n| Other financial income                       | 529    | 1,931  |\n| Total financial income                       | 44,899 | 31,074 |\n\nThe subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives refers to the measurement through profit or loss of derivatives agreed in the course of the Warburg Pincus investment in the Business Applications segment. Income from subsequent valuation mainly relates to the decrease in the conditional purchase price liabilities from Strato. For further information, please refer to Note 34.1.\n\nOther financial income mainly comprises interest income from credit balances with banks. With regard to income from loans to associated companies, please refer to Note 41.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 15. Income taxes\n\n \n\nThe income tax expense is comprised as follows:\n\n| €k                                    | 2023     | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Current income taxes                  |          |          |\n| - Germany                             | -259,213 | -249,553 |\n| - Outside Germany                     | -16,717  | -13,597  |\n| Total (current period)                | -275,930 | -263,150 |\n| Deferred taxes                        |          |          |\n| - Due to tax loss carryforwards       | -577     | 3,088    |\n| - due to tax interest carryforwards   |          |          |\n|                                       | 30,697   | 16,150   |\n| - Tax effect on temporary differences | 9,119    | 576      |\n| - Due to tax rate changes             | 1,297    | -3,422   |\n| Total deferred taxes                  | 40,536   | 16,392   |\n| Total tax expense                     | -235,394 | -246,758 |\n\nUnder German tax law, income taxes comprise corporate income tax and trade tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge.\n\nThe effective trade tax rate depends on the municipalities in which the Group operates. The average trade tax rate in fiscal year 2023 amounted to approx. 15.60% (prior year: 15.64%).\n\nAs in the previous year, German corporate income tax was levied at 15% – irrespective of whether the result was retained or distributed. In addition, a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% is imposed on the assessed corporate income tax.\n\nIn addition to taxes on the current result, current income taxes include non-period tax expenses of € 4,579k (prior year: tax income of € 4,824k).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for tax loss carryforwards, interest carryforwards, and temporary differences if it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards in certain countries are shown in the table below:\n\n| €k             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany        | 86,035 | 87,076 |\n| United Kingdom | 464    | 0      |\n|                | 86,499 | 87,076 |\n\nDeferred taxes for loss carryforwards mainly relate to the 1&1 Versatel Group. Taking into consideration significant taxable temporary differences, the realization of loss carryforwards is based in particular on the strategic importance of Versatel as an intercompany service provider for the existing Layer II products of 1&1 Telecom GmbH, as well as on significant positive earnings forecasts and the planned provision of the backbone network for the establishment of the 5G mobile communications network of 1&1 AG.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following time limits apply for the use of tax loss carryforwards in different countries:\n\n- USA: 20 years for loss carryforwards incurred before 2018, indefinite for loss carryforwards incurred from 2018 onwards\n- Germany: Indefinite, but minimum taxation\n\nTax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been formed, refer to the following countries (excluding Germany):\n\n| €k            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| USA Federal * | 27,474 | 27,307 |\n| USA State **  | 620    | 349    |\n|               | 28,094 | 27,656 |\n\n\\* Tax rate 21.0%\n\n\\*\\* Tax rate 10.0%\n\nA breakdown of income tax types results in the following loss carryforwards for Germany for which no deferred taxes have been formed:\n\n|         | 2023            |           | 2022            |           |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| €k      | Corporation tax | Trade tax | Corporation tax | Trade tax |\n| Germany | 215,941         | 89,014    | 106,250         | 25,093    |\n\nLoss carryforwards in Germany for which no deferred tax assets have been formed mainly refer to loss carryforwards of 1&1 Versatel GmbH, 1&1 Energy GmbH, and IONOS Group SE (formerly: IONOS TopCo SE).\n\nThe so-called \"interest cap\" enshrined in German tax law limits the deductibility of interest expenses for the assessment of company income taxes. Interest expenses that cannot therefore be deducted are carried forward indefinitely to the following fiscal years (interest carryforward).\n\nThe Group's interest carryforward, for which no deferred taxes were formed, amounts to € 0k (prior year: € 89,648k).\n\nIn the reporting period, additional deferred tax assets were recognized on interest carryforwards due to the positive planning of tax results. The resulting tax relief amounted to € 30,697k in the financial period (prior year: € 16,150k). Deferred tax receivables on interest carryforwards from previous years account for € 24,320k of this total.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, no interest and loss carryforwards were used (prior year: € 0k) for which deferred taxes had been formed in the previous year.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred taxes resulted from the following items:\n\n \n\n|                                      | 2023         |              | 2022         |              |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                      | Deferred tax | Deferred tax | Deferred tax | Deferred tax |\n| €k                                   | assets       | liabilities  | assets       | liabilities  |\n| Trade accounts receivable            | 1,317        | 10,530       | 1,031        | 7,927        |\n| Inventories                          | 151          | 40           | 155          | 122          |\n| Contract assets - current*           | 0            | 181,583      | 0            | 174,418      |\n| Contract assets - non current        | 0            | 60,640       | 0            | 62,169       |\n| Other financial assets – current     | 570          | 21           | 828          | 1,242        |\n| Other financial assets – non-current | 42           | 526          | 858          | 668          |\n| Other assets                         | 0            | 6,693        | 47           | 9,243        |\n| Prepaid expenses                     | 217,979      | 97,421       | 193,991      | 73,606       |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 1,968        | 20,489       | 2,268        | 19,823       |\n| Right-of-use from leases             | 79           | 248,183      | 131          | 199,587      |\n| Intangible assets                    | 31,154       | 263,058      | 42,339       | 287,731      |\n| Other accrued liabilities            | 43,174       | 7,197        | 51,135       | 8,959        |\n| Contract liabilities                 | 28,330       | 52,748       | 23,529       | 49,141       |\n| Other liabilities                    | 2,924        | 3,869        | 2,586        | 692          |\n| Lease liabilities - current          | 32,749       | 36           | 31,609       | 11           |\n| Lease liabilities - non current      | 222,573      | 9,168        | 168,308      | 2            |\n| Gross value                          | 583,010      | 962,202      | 518,815      | 895,342      |\n| Tax loss carryforwards               | 86,499       | n.a          | 87,076       | n.a          |\n| Tax interest carried forward         | 66,766       | n.a.         | 36,069       | n.a.         |\n| Adjustments for consolidation        | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            |\n| Offsetting                           | -669,183     | -669,183     | -585,671     | -585,671     |\n| Consolidated balance sheet           | 67,092       | 293,020      | 56,289       | 309,671      |\n\n\\* In the fiscal year 2022, adjustments for consolidation were allocated to the individual balance sheet items from which the relevant deferred taxes are derived.\n\nThe net balance of deferred tax liabilities of € 253,383k in the previous year decreased to a net balance of deferred tax liabilities of € 225,928k.

This change was mainly due to the following factors:\n\nDecrease in deferred tax assets from employee stock ownership plans of € 14.9m\n\n- Decrease in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets in connection with the amortization of assets from company acquisitions of € 13.5m\n- Increase in deferred tax assets from interest carryforwards of € 30.7m\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe change in the net balance of deferred taxes compared to the previous year is reconciled as follows:\n\n| €k                                                 | 2023    | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Deferred tax income + / Deferred tax expense -     | 40,536  | 16,392 |\n| Deferred tax effects recognised directly in equity | -13,081 | -4,096 |\n| Change in the net balance of deferred taxes        | 27,455  | 12,296 |\n\nThe deferred tax effects recognized in equity result mainly from the employee stock ownership plans, which are recognized in equity.\n\nThe aggregate tax rate is reconciled to the effective tax rate of continued operations as follows:\n\n| %                                                                                                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Anticipated tax rate                                                                                     | 31.4 | 31.5 |\n| Actual and deferred taxes for previous years                                                             | 0.5  | 0.7  |\n| Non-tax-deductible writedowns on financial assets                                                        | 0.3  | 0.3  |\n| Non-tax-deductible writedowns on intangible assets                                                       | 0.2  | 0.3  |\n| Tax-reduced profit from disposals and income from investments                                            | 1.2  | 0.0  |\n| Tax effects in connection with internal Group dividends and<br>disposals                                 | 0.2  | 0.1  |\n| Differences due to tax rate changes                                                                      | -1.7 | -1.2 |\n| Employee stock ownership programs                                                                        | 0.3  | 0.1  |\n| First-time capitalization of interest carryforwards that can be used in the future                       | -3.9 | -0.7 |\n| Tax effects related to the settlement of intragroup impaired loans                                       | 3.9  | 0.0  |\n| Tax losses and non-deductible interest of the fiscal year for which<br>no deferred taxes were recognized | 2.2  | 1.3  |\n| Non-taxable at-equity results                                                                            | 3.1  | 1.4  |\n| Trade tax additions                                                                                      | 1.5  | 0.6  |\n| Balance of other tax-free income and non-deductible expenses                                             | 0.2  | 0.3  |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                       | 39.4 | 34.7 |\n\nThe item \"Actual and deferred taxes for previous years\" mainly refers to actual tax expenses from the tax audit.\n\nThe item \"Tax-reduced profit from disposals and income from investments\" relates to income resulting from the IPO of IONOS Group SE.\n\nThe item \"Tax effects in connection with internal Group dividends and disposals\" relates to relates to a receivable from affiliated companies in the Business Access segment that was written down in previous years and reversed in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe item \"Non-taxable at-equity results\" mainly relates to the prorated results of the associated companies Kublai GmbH and AWIN AG.\n\nThe anticipated tax rate corresponds to the tax rate of the parent company, United Internet AG.\n\nIn accordance with the amendment to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules, the United Internet Group applies the temporary, mandatory exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of global minimum taxation.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the jurisdictions to be included for Pillar Two purposes, the following have already enacted final implementing legislation: Germany, France, Austria, Romania, and the UK. The following jurisdictions have already published draft legislation for corresponding implementation: Canada and Spain.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis based on the qualified CbCR data of the current and the three previous fiscal years as well as the forecasts for future fiscal years shows that Romania could qualify as a low-tax country for Pillar Two purposes within the United Internet Group once the legislation comes into force. This could result in an annual additional tax burden in the lower five-digit euro range for the Group as a whole from fiscal year 2024 onwards.\n\nAs in the previous year, income tax claims mainly relate to receivables from tax authorities in Germany and amounted to € 34,754k (prior year: € 34,741k) as of the balance sheet date.\n\nAs in the previous year, income tax liabilities relate primarily to liabilities to tax authorities in Germany and amounted to € 87,996k (prior year: € 52,723k) as of the balance sheet date.\n\n# 16. Earnings per share\n\n \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, capital stock was divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares (prior year: 194,000,000 shares) each with a theoretical share in the capital stock of € 1. On December 31, 2023, United Internet held 19,183,705 treasury shares (prior year: 7,284,109). These treasury shares do not entitle the Company to any rights or proportional dividends and are thus deducted from equity. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used for calculating undiluted earnings per share was 172,816,295 for fiscal year 2023 (prior year: 186,715,891).\n\nAs of the reporting date, there was a dilutive effect from employee stock ownership plans of subsidiaries of € 0.02 (prior year: € 0.01) per share.\n\nThe calculation of the dilutive effect from conversion is made by first determining the number of potential shares. On the basis of the average fair value of the shares, the number of shares is then calculated which could be acquired from the total amount of payments (par value of the rights plus additional payment). If the difference between the two values is zero, the total payment is exactly equivalent to the fair value of the potential shares and no dilutive effect need be considered. If the difference is positive, it is assumed that these shares will be issued in the amount of the difference without consideration.\n\nBased on an average market price of € 17.77 (prior year: € 26.44), this would result in the issuance of 2,585,413 shares (prior year: 461,921) without consideration. The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2023 is therefore 175,401,708 (prior year: 187,177,812).\n\nThe following table shows the underlying amounts for the calculation of undiluted and diluted earnings:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n| €k                                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to the shareholders of United Internet AG | 232,716 | 367,196 |\n| Earnings per share (in €)                                     |         |         |\n| - undiluted                                                   | 1.35    | 1.97    |\n| - diluted                                                     | 1.33    | 1.96    |\n| Weighted average of outstanding shares (in million units)     |         |         |\n| - undiluted                                                   | 172.82  | 186.72  |\n| - diluted                                                     | 175.40  | 187.18  |\n\n## 17. Dividend per share\n\nThe ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG on May 17, 2023 voted to accept the proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board to pay a dividend of € 0.50 per share. The total dividend payment of € 86.4m was made on May 22, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with section 21 of the Company's articles, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting decides on the allocation of unappropriated profit. For the fiscal year 2023, the Management Board will propose to the Supervisory Board a dividend of € 0.50 for each share entitled to dividends for the past fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board will discuss this dividend proposal at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 20, 2024.\n\nPursuant to section 71b AktG, the Company does not accrue any rights from treasury shares and thus has no pro-rated dividend rights. As at the date of signing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the United Internet Group holds 19,183,705 treasury shares (prior year: 19,183,705). The number of shares with dividend rights may change before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. In this case, a proposal will be made to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to maintain the dividend of € 0.50 per entitled no-par value share with a corresponding adjustment to the proposal for the appropriation of profit.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Explanations of items in the balance sheet\n\n## 18. Cash and cash equivalents\n\n \n\nAs of the reporting date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 27,689k (prior year: € 40,523k). Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances, checks, and cash in hand. Bank balances generally bear variable interest rates for call money. In the reporting period, United Internet received a low interest on bank balances denominated in euro of approx. 1.75% (prior year: 0%).\n\nThe development and application of cash and cash equivalents is stated in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n\n# 19.

The funds were allocated to the company's free capital reserves (section 272 (2) no. 4 HGB) without increasing the share capital. United Internet AG contributed a total amount of € 602k to the equity of Kublai GmbH.\n\nDue in part to ongoing negotiations regarding the refinancing of Tele Columbus AG and the continued significantly negative operating performance of Tele Columbus AG, the shares held in Kublai GmbH were subjected to an event-driven impairment test in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. United Internet assumed a planning horizon of 17 years to determine their fair value less selling costs. Assuming a discount rate of 4.9%, a growth rate in perpetuity of 1.0%, an EBITDA margin in perpetuity of 35.0% and a capex to sales ratio in perpetuity of 18.0%, there was a carrying amount surplus of € 166.8m as of December 31, 2023 and thus no impairment need was identified for the shares in Kublai GmbH.\n\nAn increase in the discount rate of one percentage point to 5.9% would result in an impairment of € 34.7m. A reduction in the EBITDA margin in perpetuity from 35.0% to 29.0% would also result in an impairment of € 10.5m.\n\nThe following table contains summarized financial information of the main associated companies on the basis of a shareholding of 100% as at December 31, 2022:\n\n| Summarized financial information on the main associated companies: | Kublai GmbH<br>€k | AWIN AG<br>€k |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Current assets                                                     | 196,542           | 549,661       |\n| Non-current assets                                                 | 2,312,828         | 318,578       |\n| Current liabilities                                                | 216,793           | 435,377       |\n| Non-current liabilities                                            | 1,466,141         | 39,720        |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the company                 | 788,337           | 393,191       |\n| Non-controlling interests                                          | 38,099            | 0             |\n| Shareholders' equity                                               | 826,435           | 393,191       |\n| Sales                                                              | 446,634           | 178,473       |\n| Other comprehensive income                                         | 2,338             | -1,134        |\n| Net profit/loss                                                    | -104,759          | 26,262        |\n| Total comprehensive income                                         | -102,421          | 25,128        |\n\n\\* As the full financial information of Kublai GmbH as of December 31, 2023 was not yet available to United Internet at the time of preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the summarized financial information on the carrying amount disclosed in United Internet's Consolidated Balance Sheet was calculated on the basis of the interim financial statements of Kublai GmbH as of September 30, 2022.\n\nA reconciliation with the carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022 – with an estimation of investment results for the fourth quarter – is presented below:\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n| T€                                                    | Kublai GmbH<br>€k | AWIN AG<br>€k |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the company    | 788,337           | 393,191       |\n| Share ratio of United Internet AG                     | 40%               | 20%           |\n| United Internet Group's share in the net asset values | 315,335           | 78,638        |\n| Impairment / impairment reversal effects              | 0                 | 0             |\n| Closing date-related reconciliation effects           | 0                 | 0             |\n| Carrying amount on Dec. 31, 2022                      | 315,335           | 78,638        |\n\n\\* As the full financial information of Kublai GmbH as of December 31, 2023 was not yet available to United Internet at the time of preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the reconciliation to the carrying amount disclosed in United Internet's Consolidated Balance Sheet was calculated on the basis of the interim financial statements of Kublai GmbH as of September 30, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, other associated companies disclosed an aggregated carrying amount of € 34,086k (prior year: € 35,331k) and an aggregated loss of € 3,352k (prior year: € 2,009k).

While the 3.6 GHz spectrum is already available, the frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will only be available from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe intangible assets resulting from the purchase were recognized at cost.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the frequency blocks are comprised as follows:\n\n| €k      | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| 3.6 GHz | 693,924       | 734,743       |\n| 2 GHz   | 334,997       | 334,997       |\n|         | 1,028,921     | 1,069,740     |\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band were amortized by € 40,819k (prior year: € 447k). The acquired frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will not be amortized until actual network operation commences and if these frequency blocks are also available at that time. These spectrum licenses are not yet usable and were therefore subjected to an impairment test in the fiscal year 2023. The impairment test was performed on the balance sheet date on the level of the cash-generating unit 5G. It did not result in any impairment in the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of trademarks according to the cash-generating units:\n\n| €k             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1&1 Versatel   | 62,000        | 62,000        |\n| 1&1            | 53,200        | 53,200        |\n| Mail.com       | 24,679        | 25,606        |\n| Strato         | 20,070        | 20,070        |\n| WEB.DE         | 17,173        | 17,173        |\n| home.pl        | 11,144        | 10,326        |\n| Arsys          | 7,278         | 7,278         |\n| united-domains | 4,198         | 4,198         |\n| Fasthosts      | 3,983         | 3,903         |\n| World4You      | 3,494         | 3,494         |\n| Cronon         | 463           | 463           |\n|                | 207,682       | 207,711       |\n\nThe carrying amounts of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (trademarks) totaled € 207,682k (prior year: € 207,711k).\n\nThe useful life of trademarks is determined as being indefinite, as there are no indications that the flow of benefits will end in future. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were subjected to an impairment test on the level of the cash-generating units as of the reporting date.\n\nThe rights similar to concessions result from a one-off payment in the fiscal year 2020 in connection with the exercise of the first prolongation option of the MBA MVNO agreement in order to secure direct \n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\naccess to 5G technology and as a necessary component for the establishment of the Group's own mobile communications network.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets relate to capitalized costs from software.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, there were purchase commitments for intangible assets amounting to € 68.0m (prior year: € 143.9m).\n\nThe increase in payments on account mainly relates to software for operating the 1&1 mobile communications network.\n\n## 28.

The Group's goodwill is mainly the result of the following company acquisitions:\n\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit we22 results from the acquisition of we22 AG in 2021 and has been part of the cash-generating unit IONOS SE since the fiscal year 2022.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit World4You results from the acquisition of World4You in in 2018.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access (formerly Drillisch) results from the acquisition of the Drillisch Group in 2017 and the merger of the cash-generating units 1&1 Telecom and Drillisch in 2018.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit IONOS Cloud (formerly: ProfitBricks) results from the acquisition of the ProfitBricks Group in 2017. Due to the merger in fiscal year 2019, the cash-generating unit IONOS Cloud has been incorporated into the cash-generating unit IONOS SE.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating units Versatel and 1&1 Telecom reflect goodwill from the acquisition of the Versatel Group in 2014. In the fiscal year 2018, goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Telecom was combined with the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit STRATO results from the acquisition of the STRATO Group in 2017.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit home.pl results from the acquisition of home.pl S.A. in 2015.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit Arsys results from the acquisition of Arsys Internet S.L. in 2013.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit united-domains results from the acquisition of united-domains AG in 2008.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit Fasthosts results from the acquisition of Fasthosts Internet Ltd. in 2006 and the acquisition of Dollamore Ltd. in 2008.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit InterNetX results from the acquisition of InterNetX GmbH in 2005.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Mail & Media mainly comprises goodwill from the acquisition of the portal business of WEB.DE AG in 2005.\n\n## **Scheduled impairment test on December 31, 2023**\n\n## **Measurement at fair value less disposal costs**\n\nFor the Business Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments, the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined on the basis of a calculation of fair value less disposal costs using cash flow forecasts. The hierarchy of fair value less disposal costs as defined by IFRS 13 is set at Level 3 for these impairment tests.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are based on the Company's budgets for the fiscal year 2024. These planning calculations were extrapolated by management for a period of up to 10 years (prior year: up to 10 years) for the respective cash-generating units on the basis of external market studies and internal assumptions. Following this period, management assumes the following increase in cash flow:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 1.00%         | 0.50%         |\n| Consumer Applications | 1.00%         | 1.00%         |\n| Business Applications | 1.0% - 2.2%   | 1.0% - 2.4%   |\n\nThe expected increase corresponds to long-term average growth of the sector in which the respective cash-generating unit operates.\n\nThe following discount rates were used for cash flow forecasts in the reporting period:\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 4.9%          | 3.9%          |\n| Consumer Applications | 7.8%          | 7.0%          |\n| Business Applications | 7.5% - 9.7%   | 6.9% - 9.5%   |\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend heavily on the estimation of future sales revenue. The management boards of the respective cash-generating units expect a varied development of sales within the planning horizon.\n\nSales revenue figures in the detailed planning period are based on the following average annual sales growth rates:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 5.0%          | 3.4%          |\n| Consumer Applications | 6.3%          | 7.0%          |\n| Business Applications | 4.5% - 9.9%   | 4.4% - 8.0%   |\n\nFair value less disposal costs is mainly based on the present value of the perpetual annuity, which is particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions on the long-term growth rate and the discount rate. For the calculation of fair value less disposal costs, disposal cost rates of between 0.4% and 3.0% were assumed (prior year: between 0.2% and 3.0%).\n\nThe business segments contain the following trademarks:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 62,000        | 62,000        |\n| Consumer Applications | 41,852        | 42,779        |\n| Business Applications | 50,630        | 49,732        |\n\n## **Measurement at value-in-use**\n\n \n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access is determined on the basis of a calculation of the value-in-use with the aid of cash flow forecasts.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are based on a Group budget for the fiscal year 2024 as well as a planning calculation for the fiscal years 2025 to 2029. These planning calculations were extrapolated by management on the basis of external market studies and internal assumptions for the cash-generating unit. As it is expected that a sustainable level of sales and earnings will not yet have been achieved by the end of the detailed planning period (2029), it has been extended to include an interim phase for the years 2029 to 2040 inclusive until a sustainable level of sales and earnings is to be achieved.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend heavily on the estimation of future sales revenue. Another key basic assumption for the planning of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access is the number of subscribers, the gross profit forecast based on these subscriber numbers and on empirical values, and the discount rates applied. For future years, the number of subscribers is expected to increase and the gross profit to decrease slightly.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nValue-in-use is largely determined by the present value of the perpetual annuity, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions regarding the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.\n\nThe following parameters were used for measurement:\n\n|                                             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Increase in cash flow for perpetual annuity | 1.0%          | 0.5%          |\n| Discount rate before taxes                  | 10.30%        | 8.80%         |\n| Discount rates after taxes                  | 6.4%          | 5.7%          |\n| Annual growth rates                         | 1.7%          | 1.2%          |\n| Carrying amount of trademark rights         | 53,200        | 53,200        |\n\nThis growth rate corresponds to the long-term average growth rate for the sector.\n\n## **Basic assumptions of the impairment tests**\n\nThe following table presents the basic assumptions used when checking impairment of individual cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated, in order to determine their fair value less disposal costs, or in the case of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access the value-in-use:\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n|

respect to the impairment of goodwill or trademarks depends on the respective cash-generating units.\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the cash-generating unit World4You, an increase in the discount rate (after taxes) of 1.3 percentage points and a decline in the EBITDA margin of 4.8 percentage points was assumed at the same time. These assumptions would result in impairment of € 2.2m. Without an increase in the discount rate and a simultaneous decrease in the EBITDA margin, the headroom amounts to €8m. Based on current knowledge, management does not expect any significant deviations in the EBITDA margin. Assumptions on the possible development of the cost of capital rate are based on the further interest rate increases of the fiscal year 2023. Possible opportunities from the possibilities of price adjustments as a result of increased operating costs are not taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the other cash-generating units, the discount rates (after taxes) were also increased by the year-on-year change and at the same time a CGU-specific appropriate decrease in the long-term growth rate in perpetuity and alternatively a decrease in the EBITDA margin in perpetuity were assumed. These assumptions would not result in any changes to the impairment tests for these cash-generating units.\n\n## **Spectrum**\n\nThe 5G spectrum carried in the balance sheet results from the 5G spectrum auction in 2019. 1&1 purchased two frequency blocks of 2 x 5 MHz in the 2 GHz band and five frequency blocks of 10 MHz in the 3.6 GHz band, which are each usable for a limited period up to December 31, 2040. The frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band have been available since acquisition and the frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will be available from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 5G is determined by calculating value-in-use with the aid of cash flow forecasts.\n\nThe planning calculation on which the impairment test is based includes income statement planning and capital expenditure planning for the fiscal years 2024 to 2040. As the spectrum runs until 2040, the test was conducted for the period 2024 to 2040. Due to the innovation cycle in the telecommunications industry, no perpetuity was applied.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend to a large extent on the estimate of future revenue, the assumptions regarding investments in the network infrastructure, and the ongoing operating costs of network operations. The main revenue drivers for the cash-generating unit 5G are growth in the number of 1&1 network subscribers and planning for the future data consumption of customers. The planning calculations were based on subscriber growth in the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access, while assumptions regarding future customer data consumption are based on empirical values. Planning for investments in the network infrastructure are based on specific rollout plans, which are mainly based on the rollout obligations arising from the spectrum acquisition and the contractually agreed rollout costs. Planning for the ongoing costs of network operation are based on agreements already concluded and assumptions about the development of energy costs based on experience. A further key basic assumption for the planning of the cash-generating unit is the discount rates used.\n\nThe following parameters were used for measurement:\n\n| Radio spectrum             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Discount rate before taxes | 6.0%          | 5.1%          |\n| Discount rates after taxes | 4.5%          | 3.9%          |\n\nThere was no impairment need in the reporting period. This also reflects the Management Board's qualitative expectations due to the high degree of strategic importance.\n\n## **Sensitivity of assumptions**\n\nThe sensitivity of the assumptions made with respect to an impairment of the intangible asset not yet available for use (spectrum) depends on the basic assumptions for the cash-generating unit.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the cash-generating unit 1&1 mobile telecommunications network, an increase in the discount rate of 1.0 percentage point and a rise of 5 percent in operating costs for active network technology (in particular energy costs) was assumed. These assumptions would result in impairment of approx. € 261m. Based on current knowledge, management does not expect any significant deviations in the planned costs for passive infrastructure and network rollout costs due to the contractual constellations with the network rollout partners.

The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. There are no covenants attached to the new promissory note loan.\n\nMoreover, two promissory note loan tranches totaling € 238.0m were redeemed on schedule in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, total liabilities from the promissory note loans 2017, 2021, and 2023 with maximum terms until May 2030 therefore amounted to € 1,162.0m (prior year: € 1,100.0m).\n\n#### **Syndicated loans & syndicated loan facilities**\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a banking syndicate granted United Internet AG a revolving syndicated loan facility totaling € 810m until January 2025. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made use of a contractually agreed prolongation option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated loan facility for the period from January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690m was agreed for this prolongation period.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, € 150m of the revolving syndicated loan facility had been drawn (prior year: € 550m). As a result, funds of € 660m (prior year: € 260m) were still available to be drawn from the credit facility as at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn addition to the € 150m, the disclosed loan liability of € 950m also includes the loan of € 800m concluded by IONOS Group with a banking syndicate in December 2023. This loan was used fully for the partial refinancing of the existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity.\n\n#### **Bilateral credit agreements / bilateral credit facilities**\n\nThe Company also has bilateral credit agreements with several banks totaling € 50m (prior year: € 200m). The term expires at the latest on August 12, 2024. As at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, these bilateral credit agreements were used in full (as in the previous year).\n\nIn addition, various bilateral credit facilities amounting to € 475m (prior year: € 400m) are available to the Company. These have been granted in part until further notice and in part have terms until March 31, 2025. Drawings of € 295m (prior year: € 300m) had been made from these credit facilities as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nUnited Internet therefore had free credit lines from syndicated loan facilities and bilateral credit agreements totaling € 840m (prior year: € 360m) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n| €k                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Credit lines granted   | 475,000 | 400,000 |\n| Credit lines utilized  | 294,800 | 300,000 |\n| Available credit lines | 180,200 | 100,000 |\n| Average interest rate  | 4.89    | 2.58    |\n\n**Credit lines granted (without the revolving syndicated loan facility)** \n\nNo collateral was provided for any of the liabilities due to banks.\n\nWith the exception of the interest-bearing tranches of the promissory note loan, the fair values of bank liabilities mainly correspond to their carrying amounts. For further information on the promissory note loan, please refer to Note 41.\n\nA euro cash pooling agreement (zero balancing) has been in place between United Internet AG and certain subsidiaries since July 2012. Under the agreement, credit and debit balances of the participating\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup subsidiaries are pooled and netted via several cascades in a central bank account of United Internet AG and available each banking day.\n\n#### **b) Guaranty credit facilities**\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned credit lines, the Group had guaranty credit facilities of € 105.0m (prior year: € 105.0m) as at the end of the reporting period, which in some cases can also be used by other Group companies. The guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees.\n\n#### **Guaranty credit facilities**\n\n \n\n| €k                       | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranty lines granted   | 105,000 | 105,000 |\n| Guaranty lines utilized  | 25,594  | 28,279  |\n| Available guaranty lines | 79,406  | 76,721  |\n| Average interest rate    | 0.40%   | 0.40%   |\n\nThe guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees. The guaranty credit facilities granted are mostly for unlimited periods (\"until further notice\"). One agreement is limited until December 30, 2024. No collateral was provided to banks.\n\nThe stated average interest rate as of the reporting date is based on utilization.\n\n# 32.

Where applicable, the reversal was offset against non-current assets directly in equity.\n\nOther accruals refer mainly to accruals for warranties and impending losses.\n\n## 34.

The decrease in contingent purchase price liabilities results on the one hand from the decrease in the valuation of the IONOS Group based on its stock market price. This valuation is the basis for measuring the variable purchase price components from the acquisition of STRATO AG. On the other hand, the contingent purchase price liability from the acquisition of Profit Bricks GmbH was settled in the fiscal year.\n\n## **34.2 Other current non-financial liabilities**\n\n| €k                                      | 2023    | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Other current non-financial liabilities |         |        |\n| - Liabilities to the tax office         | 112,715 | 52,432 |\n| - Other                                 | 16,919  | 16,524 |\n| Total                                   | 129,635 | 68,956 |\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nLiabilities to the tax office mainly refer to sales tax liabilities. The year-on-year increase results from a change in sales tax grouping as a result of the transfer of the 1&1 AG Group to United Internet AG and the resulting lower advance payment. The resulting sales tax will be paid to the tax authorities after the end of the advance return period.\n\n## **34.3 Other non-current financial liabilities**\n\n \n\n| €k                                          | 2023      | 2022      |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other non-current non-financial liabilities |           |           |\n| - Spectrum liabilities                      | 702,592   | 763,858   |\n| - Leasing liabilities                       | 667,836   | 537,210   |\n| - Other loans                               | 8,149     | 8,150     |\n| - Other                                     | 9,733     | 4,095     |\n| Total                                       | 1,388,310 | 1,313,313 |\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 regarding liabilities from lease commitments.\n\nSpectrum liabilities refer to the licenses acquired at auction in the fiscal year 2019. In 2019, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG signed an agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) and the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) regarding the construction of mobile communication sites in so-called \"not-spots\". 1&1 AG is thus helping to close existing supply gaps and improve the provision of mobile communications in rural regions by building base stations. In return, 1&1 AG benefits from an agreement allowing it to pay for the acquired 5G spectrum in installments.

Share-based payment – employee stock ownership plans\n\nThere were five different employee stock ownership plans in the reporting period 2022. One model with so-called Stock Appreciation Rights model United Internet (SAR UI) is aimed at the group of management board members, senior executives and managers and based on virtual stock options of United Internet AG. The second plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan Hosting (LTIP Hosting) was introduced in the second half of 2017 and is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and other employees in key positions in the Business Applications segment. The third plan, the Long Term Incentive Plan Versatel (LTIP Versatel) was introduced in the first half of 2018 and is aimed at the group of managing directors, executives and employees in key positions in the Business Access segment. The fourth plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch) was introduced in the first half of 2020, is also aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions in the Consumer Access segment and replaced in part the former SAR plan of Drillisch in 2020. The fifth plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan Portal (LTIP Portal) was introduced in the first half of 2019 and is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions in the Consumer Applications segment. The sixth program, the Stock Appreciation Rights IONOS (SAR IONOS), was introduced in the course of the IPO of IONOS in the first quarter of 2023 and is aimed at management board members of IONOS Group SE. Moreover, the existing LTIP Hosting agreements were modified in this connection.\n\n## **36.1 Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR United Internet)**\n\nUnited Internet AG has had a Stock Appreciation Rights plan (SAR plan) since 2009. SARs refer to the commitment of United Internet AG (or a subsidiary) to pay the beneficiary a cash amount equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting the option (agreed strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 120% of the strike price, which is calculated as the average closing price in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. In the case of the current tranches, the beneficiaries were in some cases awarded a maximum strike price of € 30 per SAR. Payment of value growth to the beneficiary is limited – depending on the arrangements of the different tranches – to a) 100% of the calculated share price (strike price), or b) to a fixed euro amount.\n\nIn 2023, the plan conditions were amended for one participant. In return for the amendment to the plan condition, a one-off payment was granted. The associated expense was recognized in full in 2023. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to determine this expense.\n\nIn connection with the appointment to the UI Management Board, the existing share-based remuneration of a beneficiary under the LTIP Portal plan was converted to an SAR United Internet commitment, whilst taking into account the beneficiary's service period. After consideration of the assumptions made on the modification date, no additional expenses are to be recognized. The expenses from the commitment are recognized by United Internet AG from the date of the change.\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of United Internet AG. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of United Internet AG. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the Company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, United Internet AG retains the right to fulfill its commitment (or the commitment of a subsidiary) to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring United Internet AG shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. The program is thus recognized as an equity-settled plan.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a rule, up to 25% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 24 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 50% at the earliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option. A total of up to 75% may be exercised at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; the full amount may be exercised at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. For one issue, however, exercise is possible after 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Beyond this, no further conditions have to be met for the SARs to be successfully awarded.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (for one beneficiary using the Black-Scholes model and for another beneficiary using the Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\n| Issue date                      |         | Oct. 1, 2020 |         | Apr. 01, 2023 |\n|---------------------------------|---------|--------------|---------|---------------|\n| Volume                          | 175,000 | SARs         | 300,000 | €             |\n| Average market value per option | 22.55   | €            | 7.06    | €             |\n| Strike price                    | 30.00   | €            | 16.91   | €             |\n| Share price                     | 32.47   | €            | 15.80   | €             |\n| Dividend yield                  | 1.5     | %            | 2.90    | %             |\n| Volatility of the share         | 48.20   | %            | 30.80   | %             |\n| Expected term (years)           | 5       |              | 4       |               |\n| Risk-free interest rate         | 0       | %            | 2.70    | %             |\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model / Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the options issued were calculated using the following material measurement parameters:\n\nThe limited payout per SAR was reflected by deducting the value of an option valuation at twice the strike price. With regard to the exercise windows of the SARs, the Black-Scholes valuation assumed the earliest possible exercise. The Monte Carlo simulation also assumed the earliest possible exercise. Irrespective of the selected valuation method, the respective exercise hurdles were also taken into account when exercising the option.\n\nAs the SARs have no dividend entitlement, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of United Internet AG as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated as a weighted average on the basis of the historical volatility for the last 6 (1/3 weighting) and 12 months (2/3 weighting) prior to the measurement date, respectively. The strike price is calculated on the basis of the average share price of the last 10 days prior to the issuance date.\n\nThe SAR United Internet plan has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 39,222 | 41,469 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 38,075 | 39,227 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 1,147  | 2,242  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | -1,152 | 2,361  |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                    | SAR      | Average strike price (€) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2021                                | 577,500  | 35.61                    |\n| expired / forfeited                                                | -90,000  | 30.00                    |\n| new emission                                                       | -37,500  | 41.26                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022                                | 450,000  | 32.50                    |\n| expired / forfeited                                                | -275,000 | 34.09                    |\n| new emission                                                       | 300,000  | 16.91                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023                                | 475,000  | 21.73                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023                                | 0        | n/a                      |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022                                | 0        | n/a                      |\n| Weighted average remaining term as at 31 December 2023 (in months) | 26       |                          |\n| Weighted average remaining term as at 31 December 2022 (in months) | 35       |                          |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\nThe range of strike prices for stock options outstanding at the end of the reporting period is between € 16.91 and € 30.00 (prior year: € 31.26 and € 44.06).\n\n## **36.2 Long-Term Incentive Plan Business Applications (LTIP Hosting) and Long-Term Incentive Plan WE22**\n\n#### **Long-Term Incentive Plan Business Applications (LTIP Hosting)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) was introduced for the Business Applications segment (IONOS Group) in the fiscal year 2017. The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of management (management board members and senior executives), as well as other key employees of the IONOS Group (Business Applications segment), with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the parent company (IONOS Group SE) and other companies of the IONOS Group.\n\nWithin the LTIP plan, qualifying employees in the Hosting division are awarded so-called Management Incentive Plan (MIP) units (stock appreciation rights). Vesting is on a straight-line basis (beginning with the date of issue) and on condition that the employee concerned has not resigned before the occurrence of an event defined in the LTIP agreement (trigger event). This refers to the complete sale of all shares in IONOS Group SE held by Warburg Pincus.\n\nThe partial sale of shares by Warburg Pincus does not constitute such a trigger event – neither in 2021 nor in 2023.\n\nIn the event of a trigger event, the MIP units represent a claim equivalent to the difference between the individually determined strike price and the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. The strike price is increased or decreased by equity contributions or repayments.\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares or options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no new MIP issues from the LTIP Hosting plan in the reporting period.\n\nFair value is determined on the basis of the individual strike price, the enterprise value as at the grant date and the remaining term until the trigger event, using the Black-Scholes model and taking into account the other assumptions mentioned above. As the exercise prices of the MIP units already take into account equity returns, it is not necessary to additionally consider a dividend yield when measuring the entitlements.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Business Applications peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plan Business Applications has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total program expenditure                                                  | 37,674 | 37,709 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year                      | 37,656 | 36,501 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                                      | 18     | 1,208  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                                          | 1,155  | 3,688  |\n| Fair value of the commitments granted in the fiscal year at the grant date | 0      | 0      |\n\nThe changes in the MIP units granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Units    | Average strike price (€ |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 460,071  | 173.36                  |\n| Additional grant as part of the IPO | 20,429   | 329.98                  |\n| Change into 'Rollover' programm     | -389,625 | 168.58                  |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -625     | 358.80                  |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 90,250   | 130.29                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0        | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0        | n/a                     |\n\nThe IPO did not involve a complete exit of WP XII Ventures Holdings S à r l, but only a partial sale. The IPO of IONOS Group SE on February 8, 2023 did not therefore constitute a triggering event as defined by the LTIP Hosting agreement. Accordingly, the IPO did not result in the claims of the individual participants becoming due. For the remaining participants in the LTIP Hosting, however, a further approx. 11% of the claims from the LTIP Hosting will be fixed at the issue price of the IPO on February 8, 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, all active employees of the LTIP Hosting plan were offered a so-called IPO transition agreement or rollover agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"rollover\"). As part of this rollover, active employees could convert their LTIP Hosting MIP units into subscription rights for IONOS Group SE shares.\n\nIn the course of the rollover, 389,625 MIPs were converted. The remaining MIPs mainly relate to former members of the management board.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IPO awards (virtual stock options as part of the rollover) were calculated in a two-step process based on the assumption of a complete divestment by Warburg Pincus (WP). In the first step, the increase in value per participant was derived on the basis of the LTIP (Long Term Incentive Plan) Hosting conditions. An increase in value was determined for around 25% of the shares due to a share buyback in 2021 and an enterprise value of € 4.8 billion. For the remaining approx. 75% of the MIP I units (LTIP Hosting), the increase in value at the time of the IPO was considered relevant, whereby the IPO issue price of € 18.50 was used to determine the increase in value. The total increase in value per participant was determined on the basis of these calculations.\n\nIn a second step, the increase in value achieved per participant was divided by the IPO issue price to determine the number of virtual shares in IONOS Group SE. Participants who did not achieve an increase in value by the time of the IPO did not receive any virtual shares but had the option of remaining in the LTIP Hosting. The number of calculated IPO awards was then fixed and distributed in three tranches.\n\nThe IPO awards were generally allocated in three equal tranches over a period of up to 24 months after the IPO. The number of virtual stock options could vary slightly between the tranches so that the number of options per participant and the number per tranche for each participant was a whole number. The tranches were allocated as follows:\n\n- Tranche 1 on the IPO date (February 8, 2023),\n- Tranche 2 eighteen months later (August 2024) and\n- Tranche 3 twenty-four months after the IPO (February 2025).\n\nThe payment of Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 is generally linked to remaining in the company until the payment date. It can be made in cash or in equity instruments, whereby the company reserves the right to decide how this is granted. The cash payment amount depends on the performance of the IONOS share. The cash payment for the 2023 tranche is to be classified as an exception due to the lock-up period for the sale of shares in connection with the IPO, meaning that an equity-settled commitment continues to be recognized in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nA different arrangement was made for certain participants as their service agreements ended prematurely. A total of 2,210,243 virtual stock options were calculated as of February 8, 2023.\n\nThe changes in the outstanding virtual share options resulting from the conversion of the MIP units are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Virtual share<br>options | Average strike<br>price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 0                        | n/a                         |\n| Emission IPO                        | 2,210,243                | n/a                         |\n| Payout IPO                          | -736,756                 | n/a                         |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -13,743                  | n/a                         |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 1,459,744                | n/a                         |\n\nIn the course of fulfilling Tranche 1, a total of € 13.6m was paid out to the beneficiaries.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Long-Term Incentive Plan WE22**\n\n \n\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the Business Applications segment introduced a further employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) for selected members of the management board and the managing directors of the we22 Group (we22 AG including subsidiaries and investments). The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of employees of the we22 Group (Business Applications segment) with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the we22 Group and IONOS Group SE.\n\nWithin the LTIP plan, qualifying employees of the we22 Group are allocated so-called Management Incentive Plan (MIP) units, whose value is calculated by deducting a fixed strike price from the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. Vesting is on a straight-line basis over a period of around four years (beginning with the date of issue) and on condition that the respective employee has not resigned by the end of each year or by December 31, 2024. Alternatively, in the event of a change of control at IONOS SE before the end of 2024, a portion of the beneficiaries must remain with the company until nine months after the change of control occurs in order to receive an entitlement. As such a change of control is currently not likely, this variant is not considered in the measurement of the plan. Claims are settled in cash and are therefore recognized as share-based remuneration with cash settlement.\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no new MIP issues from the LTIP WE22 plan in the reporting period.\n\nFair value was calculated using a Black-Scholes model. The volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Business Applications peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nAs the strike prices of the MIP units already take into account equity repayments, there was no additional consideration of a dividend yield when measuring the entitlements.\n\nThe WE22 plan has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                                         | 2023   | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                                                  | 128    | 2,531 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year                      | 106    | 1,308 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                                      | 22     | 1,224 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                                          | -1,202 | 639   |\n| Fair value of the commitments granted in the fiscal year at the grant date | 0      | 0     |\n\nThe changes in the MIP units granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Units  | Average strike price (€ |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 70,338 | 161.56                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2021 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| expired                             | -1,875 | 161.56                  |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 68,463 | 161.56                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0      | n/a                     |\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **36.3 Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR IONOS)**\n\nIn December 2022, a new incentive plan was also introduced for the management board members of IONOS Group SE on condition of a successful IPO. The SAR plan employs so-called Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and is treated as an equity-settled, shared-based payment transaction. SARs refer to the commitment of IONOS Group SE to pay the beneficiary a cash amount equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting the option (agreed strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 110% of the strike price after three years, 115% after four years, and 120% after five years. The strike price is calculated as the average closing price in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. Payment of value growth to the beneficiary is limited – depending on the arrangements of the different tranches – to 100% of the calculated share price (strike price), or to 150% of the calculated share price (strike price).\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of IONOS Group SE. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of IONOS Group SE. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the Company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, IONOS Group SE retains the right to fulfill its commitment to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring IONOS Group SE shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. The program is thus recognized as an equity-settled plan, as there is no present obligation to settle in cash.\n\nUp to 33.33% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 66.66% at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; and the full amount at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. Vesting is thus one-third in each of the aforementioned periods.\n\nHowever, the SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Moreover, additional reductions in the payout amounts are possible in connection with predefined ESG targets. At the time of preparing the Annual Financial Statements, these targets are not yet known. Within the framework of the ESG targets, the entitlements can be reduced by a maximum of 10% if targets are not met. The IPO of IONOS Group SE was on February 8, 2023, which also corresponds to the grant date.\n\nThe exercise behavior is based on the assumption that participants will exercise their SARs at the earliest possible date, similar to comparable programs within the United Internet Group. It is expected that one third of the SARs will be exercised in the first window after the third year, a further third after the fourth year and the final third after the fifth year, where possible. The exercise of SARs is limited to two 10-day windows per calendar year, starting shortly after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the publication of the 9-month report.\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value at the grant date of the options issued was calculated as follows:\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Issue date                      | Feb. 08, 2023   | Apr. 01, 2023   | Jul. 01, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Number of SARs                  | 4,016,216       | 195,000         | 762,000         |\n| Starting price                  | 18.50 €         | 14.82 €         | 13.02 €         |\n| Strike price                    | 18.50 €         | 14.13 €         | 13.13 €         |\n| Average market value per option | 4.81 €          | 3.92 €          | 3.28 €          |\n| Dividend yield                  | 0.20% %         | 0.27% %         | 0.31% %         |\n| Volatility of the share         | 37.39% %        | 36.77% %        | 33.54% %        |\n| Expected term (years)           | 6 years         | 6 years         | 6 years         |\n| risk-free interest rate         | 2.31% - 2.66% % | 2.27% - 2.71% % | 2.45% - 3.35% % |\n\nAs part of the simulation, both the limit on the payout per SAR and the respective exercise hurdles per tranche were taken into account. As the SARs are not entitled to dividends, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of IONOS Group SE as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated from the weighted average of the price fluctuations of the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) or the last 360 days (2/3 weighting) of the peer group of the Hosting segment, as the IONOS Group SE share price had been quoted for less than 360 days as at the reporting date.\n\nThe SAR IONOS plan had the following effects in the fiscal year:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 22,601 | n.a  |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 5,706  | n.a  |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 16,895 | n.a  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 5,706  | n.a  |\n\nThe changes in the SARs granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Number    | Average strike<br>price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 0         | 0.00                        |\n| expired / forfeited                 | 0         | 0.00                        |\n| Expenses                            | 4,973,216 | 17.51                       |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 4,973,216 | 17.51                       |\n\n## **36.4 Long-Term Incentive Plan Versatel (LTIP Versatel)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) was introduced for the Business Access segment in the fiscal year 2018. The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of management board members and other key employees of the 1&1 Versatel Group (Business Access segment) with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the company (1&1 Versatel GmbH) and other companies of the 1&1 Versatel Group.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe plan entitles the beneficiaries to participate in a specified share of any increase in value of the 1&1 Versatel Group. Within the LTIP plan, qualifying employees in the Business Access segment are allocated stock appreciation rights.\n\nVesting is on a straight-line basis over a period of six years (beginning with the date of issue), or until the occurrence of an event defined in the LTIP plan conditions (trigger event), and provided that the employee concerned has not resigned by the end of each year or by the occurrence of a trigger event. The LTIP entitlement arises as soon as the full term of the LTIP contract ends (i.e., after six years) or an event as defined by the LTIP plan conditions occurs. After six years or on occurrence of a trigger event the respective LTIP entitlement becomes due.\n\nThe LTIP entitlement is calculated as the difference between the final value and the individual starting value (in each case based on the enterprise value at the time in question), which is multiplied by the respective stock appreciation right and a dilution factor.\n\nThe recognition of expenses per participant is on a straight-line basis over the period ending with the expiry of the respective LTIP contract, provided no trigger event occurs. In the event of an (imminent) trigger event, expenses are recognized in full up to the (expected) occurrence of the trigger event. As no trigger event is currently expected, this variant is not considered in the measurement of claims. This assessment is reviewed at each reporting date. Based on the current estimates, a total period of six years is assumed in each case.\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares or options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Versatel peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plan Versatel has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 12,053 | 8,449 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 4,878  | 3,562 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 7,175  | 4,887 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 1,316  | 1,352 |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                     |                   |  | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|--|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 3.1% value growth |  | 2,743                    |\n| expired                             | 0.6%              |  | 3,695                    |\n| Allocation                          | 1.4%              |  | 4,110                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 3.9%              |  | 3,122                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0                 |  | 0                        |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0                 |  | 0                        |\n\n## **36.5 Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR 1&1)**\n\n \n\nThe Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch) plan introduced in the first half of 2018 existed until April 17, 2020. It was aimed at management board members, executives and employees in key positions and based on virtual stock options of 1&1 AG (formerly 1&1 Drillisch AG).\n\nAn SAR Drillisch was the commitment of 1&1 AG (or one of its subsidiaries) to pay the option beneficiary a consideration whose amount depended on the share price performance and the operating result (EBIT) of 1&1 AG (consolidated). As part of the SAR plan, so-called SARs were allocated which were then granted over the vesting period. An SAR corresponded to a virtual subscription right for one share of 1&1 AG. However, it was not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of 1&1 AG. The entitlement arising from an SAR depended on the development of the share price and EBIT.\n\nThe old SAR Drillisch plan was canceled during the course of fiscal year 2020. At the time of cancellation, 77,400 stock options were outstanding and replaced by new equity instruments.\n\nA new plan was introduced on April 17, 2020. The new employee stock ownership model, the so-called Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch), is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions and based on virtual stock options of 1&1 AG. According to the current conditions, an SAR Drillisch is the commitment of 1&1 AG (or one of its subsidiaries), to pay the option beneficiary a consideration equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting (strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 120% of the strike price. The strike price is the average closing price for the company share in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. Payment of value growth to the entitled person is capped at 100% of the calculated share price (strike price). In 2023, an additional issue (second issue) of SARs was made for existing participants. In contrast to the previous issues, the payout amount of the first issue was offset against the second issue.\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of 1&1 AG. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of 1&1 AG. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, 1&1 AG retains the right to fulfill its commitment (or the commitment of a subsidiary) to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring 1&1 AG shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. As there is currently no obligation to settle in cash from the Group's perspective, these obligations are recognized as equity-settled transactions.\n\nThose entitled to exercise options have an exercise window of 10 days. This begins on the 3rd day after the annual shareholders' meeting or after publication of the 9-month report. Up to 25% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 24 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 50% at the \n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nearliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option. A total of up to 75% may be exercised at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; the full amount may be exercised at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. The SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Tranches that are not exercised during the available exercise window can be exercised during the next regular exercise window for the tranche. Beyond this, no further conditions have to be met for the SARs to be successfully awarded.\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model / Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value as at the grant date of the options issued was calculated as follows:\n\n| Issue date                      |  | Apr. 01, 2023 | May 01, 2023 | Jun. 01, 2023 | Aug. 01, 2023 |\n|---------------------------------|--|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Number of SARs                  |  | 385,000       | 150,000      | 28,000        | 2,765,000     |\n| Starting price                  |  | 10.27 €       | 10.54 €      | 10.14 €       | 10.24 €       |\n| Strike price                    |  | 10.77 €       | 10.47 €      | 10.27 €       | 10.14 €       |\n| Average market value per option |  | 1.70 €        | 1.89 €       | 1.84 €        | 2.18 €        |\n| Dividend yield                  |  | 0.49%         | 0.47%        | 0.49%         | 0.49%         |\n| Volatility of the share         |  | 28.83%        | 28.99%       | 29.89%        | 29.65%        |\n| Expected term (years)           |  | 5 years       | 5 years      | 5 years       | 5 years       |\n| risk-free interest rate         |  | 2.71%         | 2.84%        | 2.97%         | 3.29%         |\n\n| Issue date                      |  | Jan. 1, 2022 |       | Oct. 01, 2022 |       |\n|---------------------------------|--|--------------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| Number of SARs                  |  | 258,000      |       | 21,000        |       |\n| Starting price                  |  | 24.02        | €     | 13.49         | €     |\n| Strike price                    |  | 24.11        | €     | 14.28         | €     |\n| Average market value per option |  | 4.05         | €     | 1.81          | €     |\n| Dividend yield                  |  | 0.21         | %     | 0.37          | %     |\n| Volatility of the share         |  | 31.05        | %     | 22.47         | %     |\n| Expected term (years)           |  | 5            | years | 5             | years |\n| risk-free interest rate         |  | 0            | %     | 1.363         | %     |\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated as a weighted average on the basis of the historical volatility for the last 6 (1/3 weighting) and 12 months (2/3 weighting) prior to the measurement date, respectively. The strike price is calculated on the basis of the average share price of the last 10 days prior to the issuance date.\n\nThe capped payout per SAR was reflected by deducting the value of an option valuation at twice the strike price. With regard to the exercise windows of the SARs, the option valuation assumed the earliest possible exercise. As the SARs have no dividend entitlement, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of 1&1 AG as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the fair value of the secondary issues in order to illustrate the offsetting of the payout amount between the old tranche and the second tranche for selected participants. With regard to the exercise windows, the earliest possible exercise was assumed for the simulation. Moreover, both the capped payout per SAR and the respective exercise hurdles per tranche were taken into account. In accordance with IFRS 2.B34, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the 1&1 AG share price as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SAR Drillisch plan has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 15,066 | 9,871 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 8,252  | 6,877 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 6,814  | 2,994 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 1,375  | 1,834 |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Number    | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 | 2,745,000 | 20.23                    |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -396,500  | 20.14                    |\n| Expenses - Reallocation             | 258,000   | 24.11                    |\n| Expenses - Reallocation             | 21,000    | 14.28                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 2,627,500 | 20.58                    |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -483,000  | 21.70                    |\n| Expenses                            | 3,328,000 | 10.23                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 5,472,500 | 14.18                    |\n\n## **36.6 Long-Term Incentive Plan Portal (LTIP Consumer Application)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (LTIP Portal) was introduced by 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE in the fiscal year 2019. The LTIP is designed to attract and retain skilled employees as well as to align the long-term interests of management board members, executives, and other key employees of the group with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the company (1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE) and other companies of the group.\n\nThe plan entitles the beneficiaries to participate in a certain proportion of the increase in value of the 1&1 Mail & Media Group. Within the LTIP plan, qualifying employees are allocated stock appreciation rights.\n\nVesting is on a straight-line basis over an individually defined period (four to six years, beginning with the date of issue), or until the occurrence of a special event defined in the LTIP plan conditions (trigger event), and provided that the employee concerned has not resigned by the end of each year or by the occurrence of a trigger event. The LTIP entitlement arises as soon as the full term of the LTIP contract or a trigger event occurs.\n\nThe recognition of expenses per participant is on a straight-line basis over the period ending with the expiry of the respective LTIP contract, provided no trigger event occurs. In the event of an (imminent) trigger event, expenses are recognized in full up to the (expected) occurrence of the trigger event. As no trigger event is currently expected, this variant is not considered in the measurement of claims. This assessment is reviewed at each reporting date. Based on the current estimates, a total period of four to six years is assumed (depending on the individual agreement).\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares in the company, provided they are traded on a stock exchange in the meantime, or shares in another company listed on a stock exchange, or the corresponding options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Portal peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe LTIP Consumer Application has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                               | 8,943 | 9,407 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year   | 5,906 | 4,928 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                   | 3,037 | 4,479 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                       | 978   | 1,693 |\n| Fair value of commitments granted in the financial year | 0     | 0     |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Value growth shares | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 5.0% value growth   | 1,881                    |\n| Allocation                          | 1.0%                | 2,496                    |\n| expired                             | 0.7%                | 4,327                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 5.3%                | 1,982                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0                   | 0                        |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0                   | 0                        |\n\n## 37. Capital stock\n\nFollowing the capital reduction through cancellation of 2 million treasury shares, as resolved by the Management Board with the approval of the Supervisory Board on February 14, 2023, the fully paid-in capital stock as of December 31, 2023 amounted to €192,000,000 (prior year: € 194,000,000) divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares with a theoretical share in the capital stock of € 1.00 each.\n\n#### **Authorized Capital**\n\nAuthorized Capital 2020, which authorized the Management Board to increase the capital stock by a maximum of € 77,500,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par shares for cash and/or non-cash contributions), expired on August 31, 2023. On May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted a resolution to create a new Authorized Capital 2023 with effect from September 1, 2023 with\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe possibility to exclude subscription rights and a corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association.\n\n \n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock in the period ending August 31, 2026, by a maximum of € 75,000,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par shares for cash and/or non-cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2023). In the case of cash contributions, the new shares may – at the option of the Management Board – also be underwritten, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by one or several credit institutions and/or any other company fulfilling the requirements of section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG subject to the obligation to offer the shares only to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription rights).\n\nShareholders are to be granted subscription rights with the following restrictions. The Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the right to subscribe in the case of fractional amounts and also to exclude subscription rights to the extent that this should be necessary in order to grant subscription rights for new shares to bearers of warrants and convertible bonds issued by the Company or its subsidiaries in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligation.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a capital increase in return for cash contributions, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for an amount of up to 10% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or – if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted if the new shares are issued at an issuance price which is not substantially below the market price of those Company shares already listed at the time of the final determination of the issuance price, which is to be as near in time as possible to the share issue date. This maximum amount includes any shares that are issued or to be issued under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded; also, the amount must take into account any shares that are issued or sold during the term of this authorization pursuant to or in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG.\n\nThe Management Board is further authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the case of capital increases in return for non-cash contribution in order to grant shares for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in companies or other assets, including rights and receivables, or as part of business combinations.\n\nThe above mentioned authorizations to exclude subscription rights are limited in total to an amount of up to 20% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or – if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted. This maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to conversion and/or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds that are issued with warrant and/or conversion rights or conversion obligations during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to treasury shares sold or used during the term of this authorization in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe Management Board is further authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and its execution.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Conditional Capital**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 also adopted a resolution to cancel the existing authorization to issue warrants and/or convertible bonds and the associated Conditional Capital 2020 and to issue a new authorization to issue warrants and/or convertible bonds, with the exclusion of subscription rights to these warrants and/or convertible bonds, and at the same time to create conditional capital (Conditional Capital 2023) with a corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association.\n\nThe capital stock is conditionally increased by up to € 18,500,000.00, divided into up to 18,500,000 new no-par value registered shares (Conditional Capital 2023). The conditional capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that the bearers or holders of warrant rights or conversion rights or obligations under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds that have been issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Company's subordinated Group companies in the period ending August 31, 2026, on the basis of the Management Board's authorization resolved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023, exercise their warrant or conversion rights or, to the extent that they are obligated to convert their bonds, fulfill their obligation, or to the extent that the Company exercises a right to grant shares in the Company, instead of paying the cash amount due (or parts thereof), and to the extent that cash compensation is not granted or treasury shares or shares in another listed company are not used to service bonds. The new shares will be issued at the warrant or conversion price to be determined in accordance with the above authorizing resolution. The new shares will participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created; to the extent that it is legally permissible, the Management Board may determine, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the profit participation of new shares and, notwithstanding section 60 (2) AktG, also for a fiscal year already expired.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details concerning the execution of the conditional capital increase.\n\n#### **Interim dividend**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 created the option of paying an interim dividend with a corresponding amendment to section 21 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## 38. Reserves\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, capital reserves amounted to € 2,197m (prior year: € 1,966m). The increase is mainly due to the sale of shares in IONOS Group SE in the course of the IPO.\n\nUnited Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292m from the sale of shares. The corresponding share of equity in IONOS Group SE amounted to € -16.4m, while the disposal costs recognized in equity amounted to € 3.1m. Taking into account the prorated earnings of around € 1.6m, the total effect of the IPO on reserves amounted to € 303.7m. For further information, please refer to Notes 4 and 46.\n\nMoreover, the reversal of deferred tax assets on employee stock ownership plans and payments in connection with employee stock ownership plans reduced reserves by a total of € 10.6m.\n\nReserves were also reduced by the cancellation of treasury shares amounting to € 61.5m. For further information, please refer to Note 39.\n\nThe accumulated result includes the past results of consolidated companies, less amounts for dividends payouts.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the revaluation reserve attributable to shareholders of United Internet AG consisted of the following items:\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n| €k                                                                | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |               |               |\n| Other shares                                                      | 0             | 0             |\n| Share in other comprehensive income of associated companies:      | 920           | 1,595         |\n| Other shares                                                      | -816          | -312          |\n| Total                                                             | 105           | 1,283         |\n\nTranslation differences from the annual financial statements of foreign subsidiaries without an effect on profit or loss are recognized in the currency translation adjustment.\n\nAn overview of the composition and changes in the reserves described above for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 is provided in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.\n\n# 39. Treasury shares\n\n \n\nThe authorization to acquire and use treasury shares that was granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 20, 2020, under agenda item 15 in accordance with section 71 (1) no. 8 AktG expired on August 31, 2023. Against this background, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 authorized the Management Board pursuant to section 71 (1) number 8 AktG and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to acquire treasury shares for every permissible purpose, within the scope of legal restrictions and subject to the provisions set out under agenda item 11, during the period September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2026. The authorization is limited to a total share of 10% of the capital stock existing at the time the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting adopted the resolution or – if this amount is lower – at the time the authorization is exercised. As of the balance sheet date, a total of 19,183,705 treasury shares were held.\n\nTreasury shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer made to all shareholders or through a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers or by granting tender rights to the shareholders.\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized, in addition to a sale via the stock exchange or a use in another manner that complies with the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders, to use treasury shares for the following purposes:\n\n- as (partial) consideration in connection with the acquisition of companies or interests in companies or parts of companies or in connection with business combinations;\n- to float shares of the Company on foreign stock exchanges on which they were previously not admitted to trading;\n- to grant shares of the Company to current and former members of the Management Board and employees of the Company as well as to current and former members of the management boards or, as the case may be, boards of directors and employees of affiliates of the Company within the meaning of sections 15 et seqq. AktG in fulfillment of claims under virtual share participation programs. To the extent members of the Company's Management Board are to be granted shares, the Company's Supervisory Board decides thereon.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders' statutory subscription rights with regard to these treasury shares are excluded in accordance with sections 71 (1) no. 8 and 186 (3) and (4) AktG to the extent that these shares are used pursuant to the above authorizations. Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights for fractional shares if treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe authorization may not be used for the purpose of trading with treasury shares.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9m shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9m. In the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period.

Their carrying amounts on the reporting date are thus similar to fair value.\n- Investments and derivatives are carried at fair value. In the case of the remaining other non-current financial assets carried at amortized cost, it is assumed that their carrying amounts correspond to fair value.\n- Trade accounts payable mostly have short remaining terms. Their carrying amounts on the reporting date are thus similar to fair value. The same applies to current liabilities due to banks.\n- Non-current liabilities to banks mainly comprise promissory note loans, syndicated loans, bank loans, and credit facilities. Depending on their structure, these have either fixed or variable interest rates. In the case of most variable-interest liabilities, both the basic interest rate and the margin are variable. The margin depends on predefined KPIs of the United Internet Group. Due to these factors, it is assumed that their carrying amounts of non-current liabilities correspond approximately to fair value. The fair value measurement of the promissory note loans is based at least in part on input parameters not observable on the market. For further details on interest and maturity, please refer to Note 31.\n- Due to changed interest rates, there are slight deviations between the carrying value and fair value of receivables in connection with finance leases.\n- The conditional purchase price liabilities are carried at fair value. In the case of the remaining other non-current financial liabilities carried at amortized cost, it is assumed that their carrying amounts correspond to fair value.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                        | Measureme<br>nt category<br>acc. to | Carrying<br>amount on<br>Dec. 31, | Amortized  | Fair value<br>not through<br>profit or | Fair value<br>through<br>profit or | Measureme<br>nt acc. to | Fair value as<br>of Dec. 31, |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| €k                                                                     | IFRS 9                              | 2022                              | cost       | loss                                   | loss                               | IFRS 16                 | 2022                         |\n| Financial assets                                                       |                                     |                                   |            |                                        |                                    |                         |                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                              | ac                                  | 40,523                            | 40,523     |                                        |                                    |                         | 40,523                       |\n| Trade accounts receivable                                              |                                     |                                   |            |                                        |                                    |                         |                              |\n| -

Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at December 31, 2023, and as in the previous year, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, are not materially different from their calculated fair values.\n- The fair value of bank loans and other financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. They are therefore allocated to level two of the fair value hierarchy.\n- Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are measured using appropriate measurement techniques. Where available, stock exchanges prices on active markets are used. The valuation of shares in non-listed companies is based mainly on present value models. The valuation of derivatives and conditional purchase price liabilities is based mainly option pricing models.\n\n## **Fair value hierarchy**\n\n \n\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by measurement technique:\n\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.\n\n## **Assets and liabilities measured at fair value**\n\n| €k                                                                  | as of Dec. 31,<br>2023 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss               | 14,852                 | 36      |         | 14,816  |\n| Derivatives                                                         | 14,852                 | 36      |         | 14,816  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss | -13,019                |         |         |         |\n| Purchase price liabilities                                          | -10,922                |         |         | -10,922 |\n| Derivatives                                                         | -2,097                 | -2,097  |         |         |\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no transfers between levels during the reporting period.\n\n| €k                                                                     | as of Dec. 31,<br>2022 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                  | 64,536                 | 4,715   |         | 59,821  |\n| Derivatives                                                            | 64,536                 | 4,715   |         | 59,821  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value through<br>profit or loss | -38,656                |         |         | -38,219 |\n| Purchase price liabilities                                             | -38,219                |         |         | -38,219 |\n| Derivatives                                                            | -437                   | -437    |         |         |\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the main non-observable input factors for the fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and a quantitative sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| Dec. 31, 2023                        | Measurement method     | Main non-observable input factors                             | Considered in measurement | Sensitivity of input factor on fair value |                 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Foreign currency-based derivatives   | Monte Carlo simulation | Exit date of Warburg Pincus from Business Application segment | 0.25 year                 | 0.5 year                                  |                 |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | n.a.                                      |                 |\n|                                      |                        | Volatility                                                    | 5.8%                      | -<br>€ 0.2 million                        |                 |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | +1%                                       | n.a.<br>-1%     |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | +<br>€ 0.2 million                        | -

Members who do not personally attend meetings of the Supervisory Board or of the Audit and Risk Committee held in person (e.g., by participating via telephone or videoconference) always receive only 25% of the attendance fee, and if they participate solely by submitting a voting rights message are not entitled to any attendance fee.\n\nThe following table provides details on the compensation received by members of the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG:\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023                                    | United Internet AG |       |                 | Subsidiaries of United Internet AG |       |                 |       |       |                 | Total |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|-------|-----------------|-------|\n|                                         | €k                 | Fixed | Attendan ce fee | Total                              | Fixed | Attendan ce fee | Total | Fixed | Attendan ce fee |       |\n| Philipp von Bismarck                    | 145                | 25    | 170             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 145   | 25    | 0               | 170   |\n| Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei-Yee Weiß           | 30                 | 17    | 47              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 30    | 17    | 0               | 47    |\n| Dr. Manuel Cubero del Castillo-Olivares | 45                 | 15    | 60              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 45    | 15    | 0               | 60    |\n| Stefan Rasch                            | 55                 | 26    | 81              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 55    | 26    | 0               | 81    |\n| Prof. Dr. Andreas Söffing               | 95                 | 27    | 122             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 95    | 27    | 0               | 122   |\n| Prof. Dr. Franca Ruhwedel               | 37                 | 9     | 46              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 37    | 9     | 0               | 46    |\n|                                         | 407                | 118   | 525             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 407   | 118   | 0               | 525   |\n\n| 2022                                       |       |          | United Internet AG | Subsidiaries of United Internet AG |          |       |       |          |       | Total |  |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|----------|-------|-------|--|\n|                                            |       | Attendan |                    |                                    | Attendan |       |       | Attendan |       |       |  |\n| €k                                         | Fixed | ce fee   | Total              | Fixed                              | ce fee   | Total | Fixed | ce fee   | Other | Total |  |\n| Philipp von Bismarck                       | 145   | 29       | 174                | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 145   | 29       | 0     | 174   |  |\n| Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei<br>Yee Weiß           | 30    | 14       | 44                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 30    | 14       | 0     | 44    |  |\n| Dr. Claudia Borgas<br>Herold               | 20    | 5        | 25                 | 67                                 | 5        | 72    | 87    | 10       | 0     | 97    |  |\n| Dr. Manuel Cubero del<br>Castillo-Olivares | 45    | 15       | 60                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 45    | 15       | 0     | 60    |  |\n| Stefan Rasch                               | 55    | 29       | 84                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 55    | 29       | 0     | 84    |  |\n| Prof. Dr. Andreas<br>Söffing               | 95    | 30       | 125                | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 95    | 30       | 0     | 125   |  |\n|                                            | 390   | 122      | 512                | 67                                 | 5        | 72    | 457   | 127      | 0     | 584   |  |\n\nThere are no subscription rights or share-based payments for members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n \n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the remuneration of the Management Board. The members of the Management Board are compensated according to performance. This compensation consists of a fixed and a variable element (bonus). A target remuneration figure is agreed for the fixed component and the bonus, which is regularly reviewed. The last review was made in fiscal year 2022. The fixed remuneration component is paid monthly as a salary. The size of the bonus depends on reaching certain, fixed financial targets agreed at the beginning of the fiscal year. These targets are based mainly on sales and earnings figures. The target attainment corridor is generally between 90% to 120%. No bonus is paid below 90% of the agreed target and the bonus calculation ends at 120% of the agreed target. No subsequent amendment of the performance targets is allowed. There is no minimum guaranteed bonus. Payment is generally made after the Annual Financial Statements have been adopted by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThere are no retirement benefits from the Company to members of the Management Board.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, the following table provides details on the compensation received by members of the Management Board:\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023             | Fixed | Variable | Fringe benefits | Total fixed,<br>variable and<br>fringe benefits | Market value of<br>share-based<br>payment<br>granted in 2023 |\n|------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ralph Dommermuth | 0     | 0        | 0               | 0                                               | -                                                            |\n| Martin Mildner   | 163   | 96       | 1,253           | 1,512                                           | -                                                            |\n| Markus Huhn      | 413   | 150      | 6               | 569                                             | -                                                            |\n| Ralf Hartings    | 375   | 188      | 8               | 571                                             | 2,118                                                        |\n|                  | 951   | 434      | 1,267           | 2,652                                           | 2,118                                                        |\n\n| 2022             | Fixed | Variable | Fringe benefits | Total fixed, variable and fringe benefits | Market value of share-based payments granted in 2022 |\n|------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ralph Dommermuth | 0     | 0        | 0               | 0                                         | 0                                                    |\n| Martin Mildner   | 650   | 350      | 11              | 1,011                                     | -                                                    |\n|                  | 650   | 350      | 11              | 1,011                                     | -                                                    |\n\n\\* Share-based remuneration (SARs) are remuneration components with a long-term incentive and are paid out over a total period of 6 years.\n\nTotal Management Board remuneration as defined by section 314 (1) number 6 a and b HGB, i.e., including negative effects from the change in share-based payments, amounted to € 1,614k (prior year: € 1,011k).\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, the total Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration was as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term benefits                                   | 2,677 | 1,523 |\n| Benefits after termination of employment              | 0     | 0     |\n| Other benefits due in the long term                   | 0     | 0     |\n| Benefits on the occasion of termination of employment | 500   | 0     |\n| Share-based payments                                  | -811  | 2,354 |\n|                                                       | 2,366 | 3,877 |\n\nSARs were granted to the Management Board members Ralf Hartings and Markus Huhn in the reporting period.

Objectives and methods of financial risk management\n\n## **Principles of risk management**\n\n \n\nThe risk management system introduced by the United Internet Group is based on the COSO-ERM framework and is described in detail in the Management Report.\n\nThe principles of finance policy are set by the Management Board and monitored by the Supervisory Board. Certain transactions require the prior approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe main financial liabilities used by the Group include bank loans, promissory note loans and overdraft facilities, trade accounts payable, and other financial liabilities.\n\nThe Group holds various financial assets which result directly from its business activities. They consist mainly of trade accounts receivable, and short-term deposits.\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group mainly held primary financial instruments.\n\nThe aim of financial risk management is to limit these risks through ongoing operating and financial activities. The Group is hereby exposed to certain risks with regard to its assets, liabilities, and planned transactions, especially liquidity risks and market risks, as described below.\n\n## **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk constitutes the risk that a company will be unable to meet the financial obligations arising from its financial liabilities. As in the previous year, the general liquidity risk of United Internet consists of the possibility that the Group may not be able to meet its current financial obligations in due time. Especially in view of the cost-intensive rollout of the mobile communications network over many years, both short-term liquidity forecasts and longer-term financial planning are conducted in order to secure the solvency and the financial flexibility of the United Internet Group at all times. We expect to be able to cover investments in the mobile communications network predominantly from existing liquidity and future cash flows from operating activities, as well as loans.\n\nAs a result of the expected positive contribution to liquidity from operations and the interest-optimized use of the credit lines already granted, the Group is able to ensure the continual coverage of its financial needs at all times. The credit commitments granted to the Company by banks and the existing syndicated loan facility offer sufficient flexibility for these needs. In order to maintain financial stability, a balanced financial structure is sought which provides both the diversification of financial instruments and a balanced maturity profile.\n\nGlobal cash requirements and surpluses are managed by the central liquidity management system. The daily automated pooling of bank balances held by the participating Group companies (cash pooling) provides United Internet AG at all times with the predominant proportion of its cash denominated in euro. The Group has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank and netting accounts as well as for the execution of payment transactions.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the Company had total liquid funds of € 27.7m (prior year: € 40.5m) as well as free credit lines of € 842m (prior year: € 360m) and thus has more than sufficient liquidity reserves for the fiscal year 2024. The Management Board assumes that additional lines can be raised on the capital market if necessary.\n\nThe following tables show all contractually fixed payments for redemption, repayments, and interest for financial liabilities carried in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\n|                             | Carrying<br>amount on |           |         |           |         |         |           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|\n| €k                          | Dec. 31,<br>2023      | 2024      | 2025    | 2026      | 2027    | > 2027  | Total     |\n| Liabilities due to banks    | 2,464,260             | 621,195   | 335,441 | 1,384,175 | 229,847 | 78,839  | 2,649,496 |\n| Trade accounts payable      | 702,578               | 699,220   | 0       | 0         | 0       | 3,358   | 702,578   |\n| Other financial liabilities | 913,046               | 200,406   | 128,568 | 133,523   | 128,438 | 322,111 | 913,046   |\n|                             | 4,079,884             | 1,520,820 | 464,009 | 1,517,698 | 358,285 | 404,308 | 4,265,119 |\n| Lease liabilities           | 797,249               | 137,742   | 94,463  | 92,905    | 85,765  | 483,575 | 894,450   |\n|                             | 4,877,133             | 1,658,562 | 558,472 | 1,610,602 | 444,050 | 887,883 | 5,159,569 |\n\nPayments from other financial liabilities mainly comprise payment obligations in connection with the 5G spectrum auction of € 61.3m (prior year: € 61.3m), as well as expected payments from derivatives of € 10.9m (prior year: € 38.2m) in the fiscal year 2024. Payments to the German government do not follow a linear pattern. Cash outflows of € 61.3m (prior year: € 61.3m) are expected in the fiscal years 2024 and 2030, as well as cash outflows of € 128m (prior year: € 128m) each year in the fiscal years 2025 to 2029.\n\n| €k                          | Carrying<br>amount on<br>Dec. 31,<br>2022 | 2023      | 2024    | 2025    | 2026      | > 2026    | Total     |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Liabilities due to banks    | 2,155,499                                 | 679,071   | 242,785 | 265,911 | 814,025   | 226,013   | 2,227,804 |\n| Trade accounts payable      | 566,916                                   | 562,618   | 0       | 0       | 0         | 4,298     | 566,916   |\n| Other financial liabilities | 999,910                                   | 232,606   | 61,441  | 128,442 | 128,444   | 449,021   | 999,954   |\n|                             | 3,722,325                                 | 1,474,294 | 304,226 | 394,353 | 942,469   | 679,331   | 3,794,673 |\n| Lease liabilities           | 646,954                                   | 117,885   | 76,710  | 77,976  | 68,799    | 354,320   | 695,691   |\n|                             | 4,369,279                                 | 1,592,180 | 380,936 | 472,329 | 1,011,268 | 1,033,651 | 4,490,364 |\n\nFor the calculation of cash flows from liabilities to banks, management assumed that the portion of the revolving syndicated loan facility currently used amounting to € 150m (prior year: € 550m) would remain constantly drawn until the end of its term (2025).\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease refer to Note 0 for details on interest and redemption payments for liabilities to banks.\n\nThe Company has no significant concentration of liquidity risks.\n\n## **Market risk**\n\n \n\nThe activities of United Internet are mainly exposed to financial risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock exchange prices, and credit or contingency risks.\n\n#### **Interest risk**\n\nThe interest (rate) risk refers to the risk that fair values or future interest payments on existing and future financial liabilities may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group is fundamentally exposed to interest risks as some of its financial instruments as of the reporting date bear variable interest rates with varying terms. An interest risk exists for drawdowns under the revolving syndicated loan and the syndicated loan totaling € 150m (prior year: € 550m).\n\nWith the aid of the liquidity planning, various investment possibilities or possibilities to reduce surplus liquidity are constantly analyzed. The maturity profile and amount of the Group's variable-rate financial instruments are regularly reviewed and appropriate measures are taken to ensure liquidity and the management of interest risks.\n\nMarket interest rate changes might have an adverse effect on the interest result and are included in our calculation of sensitive factors affecting earnings. In order to present market risks, United Internet has developed a sensitivity analysis which shows the impact of hypothetical changes to relevant risk variables on pre-tax earnings. The reporting period effects are illustrated by applying these hypothetical changes in risk variables to the stock of financial instruments as of the reporting date. A 1% increase or decrease in the Euribor would have affected the financial result of the fiscal year by € +13,342k and € - 13,145k, respectively.\n\nThe Group does not expect any material changes in risk premiums in the foreseeable future. United Internet currently regards the interest risk for its existing variable-rate financial instruments as low.\n\nThe interest risk is negligible for other interest-bearing liabilities. At the end of the reporting period, there were no external interest-hedging transactions.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nA currency risk is the risk that fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments may fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The Group companies are mainly exposed to currency risks as a result of their operations (if revenue and/or expenses are in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective company). In order to cover such foreign currency risks, United Internet strives to achieve an equilibrium between the incoming and outgoing payments in non-functional currencies (so-called natural hedging). Currency risks which do not affect cash flows (i.e., risks from translating the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign companies) are not hedged against. With regard to operating activities, individual Group companies perform their business mainly in their respective functional currencies. As in the previous year, the currency risk from operations is therefore regarded as low. In the reporting period, there were no currency risks which significantly affected cash flows. At the end of the reporting period, there were no external currency-hedging transactions.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe currency risks arising from original financial instruments in a currency and of a monetary nature other than that of the functional currency as of the reporting date were valued by the Company. No material currency risks arose from this analysis.\n\n#### **Stock exchange risk (valuation risk)**\n\nThe United Internet Group recognizes financial assets (equity instruments) as follows:\n\n- measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition or\n- measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nDepending on the measurement category and the share price development of listed investments, changes in equity without affecting income, or income and expenses, may arise.\n\nThere were no listed equity instruments as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n#### **Credit and contingency risk**\n\nAs a result of its operating activities, the Group is exposed to a contingency risk. In order to reduce default risks, a sophisticated and preventive fraud management system has been established which is permanently enhanced. Outstanding amounts are monitored locally and on a continual basis. Individual and lump-sum allowances are made to account for non-avoidable contingency risks.\n\nWith regard to trade accounts receivable, the maximum risk in the gross amount stated in the balance sheet is before allowances. Trade accounts receivable which are not impaired as of the reporting date, are classified according to periods in which they become overdue (see Note 19).\n\n## **Internal rating system**\n\nA pre-contractual fraud check is generally conducted and collection agencies are also used for the management of receivables. In addition, a pre-contractual check of creditworthiness is made in the media sales business.\n\nThe Company has no significant concentration of credit risks.\n\n## **Risks from financial covenants**\n\nThe existing loans of United Internet AG are tied to so-called financial covenants. The infringement of a certain net debt-to-EBITDA ratio could result in individual banks terminating outstanding loans with the Company. In view of the low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of United Internet at present, the probability of infringement is regarded as low. Compliance with the covenants is regularly monitored by the Company's Management Board and was met throughout the year.\n\n## **Capital management**\n\nIn addition to the legal provisions for stock corporations, United Internet AG has no further obligations to maintain capital according to its statutes or other agreements. The key financial indicators used by the Company are mainly performance-oriented. The targets, methods, and processes of capital management are thus subordinate to these performance-oriented financial indicators.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to maintain and adapt its capital structure, the Company can adjust dividend payments or pay capital back to its shareholders, can purchase treasury shares and place them again if required, or issue new shares. Please refer to the statement of changes in shareholders' equity. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no changes were made to the Company's targets, methods, and processes.\n\nPlease refer to Note 31 for further details.\n\n# 44. Contingencies, contingent liabilities, and other commitments\n\n## **Contingent liabilities**\n\n \n\nContingent liabilities represent a possible obligation whose existence depends on the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, or a current obligation whose payment is not likely or whose amount cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nIn the previous years, advance service providers have filed claims in the low three-digit million range (for the purposes of internal classification, amounts of up to € 333m are defined as being in the low three-digit million range, and the claims filed do not exceed this amount in total). As of the reporting date December 31, 2023, United Internet AG considers the claims of the counterparties to be unfounded and regards an outflow of resources for these contingent liabilities as unlikely.\n\n## **Litigation**\n\nLitigation risks mainly relate to various legal disputes of Group subsidiaries.\n\nAccruals for litigation were formed for any commitments arising from these disputes (see Note 33).\n\n## **Guarantees**\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group has issued no guarantees.\n\n## **Guarantees and other obligations**\n\nThe Company is jointly and severally liable for credit lines granted to companies of the United Internet Group by a bank. The credit facilities had only been utilized with regard to guarantees as of the reporting date.\n\nThe Management Board has no knowledge of any other facts which could have a significant, adverse effect on the business activities, the financial situation or the operating result of the Company.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 45. Leases and other financial commitments\n\n## **Group as lessee**\n\nThe obligations mainly comprise leased network obligations including subscriber lines, buildings, technical equipment, and vehicles.\n\nMost leases have options to prolong the contractual relationship. The terms of these prolongation options are negotiable or identical with the current terms. The Company currently intends to exercise all material prolongation options. The Company does not intend to exercise any material termination options. In the case of leases for antenna locations in connection with the 1&1 mobile network, however, no prolongation options beyond the non-cancelable basic term are included in the term as there is no reasonable certainty that they will be exercised (see Note 3). If exercised, the prolongation options not included in the measurement pursuant to IFRS 16 will result in future payment obligations of € 133m (December 31, 2022: € 2.6m).

The maturities range from 15 to 29 years.\n\n## **Operating leases**\n\n1&1 Versatel is a lessor as part of operating leases. The underlying agreements mainly relate to the leasing of fiber-optic pairs. The agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments. Due to the strategic importance of the leased fiber-optic pairs for the respective lessees, the residual value risk is considered to be minor.\n\nTotal income from operating leases amounted to € 40,656k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: € 43,779k). These are entirely attributable to fixed lease payments.\n\nThe maturities of lease payments from operating leases is shown in the table below:\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Due dates in k€ | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| up to 1 year    | 26,849        | 29,085        |\n| 1 to 2 years    | 20,920        | 23,384        |\n| 2 to 3 years    | 18,060        | 19,883        |\n| 3 to 4 years    | 17,344        | 17,222        |\n| 4 to 5 years    | 15,915        | 16,618        |\n| Over 5 years    | 20,005        | 35,168        |\n|                 | 119,093       | 141,360       |\n\n## **Other financial commitments**\n\nThe main other financial commitments are described below:\n\n| December 31, 2023                  |         |             |\n|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|\n| €k                                 | Current | Non-current |\n| Unrecognized lease obligations     | 1,418   | 250         |\n| Supply and service relationships   | 131,203 | 390,539     |\n| thereof from advertising contracts | 9,935   | 21,920      |\n| Total*                             | 132,621 | 390,790     |\n\n#### **December 31, 2022**\n\n \n\n| €k                                 | Current | Non-current |\n|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|\n| Unrecognized lease obligations     | 2,671   | 1,868       |\n| Supply and service relationships   | 53,298  | 148,030     |\n| thereof from advertising contracts | 19,595  | 31,143      |\n| Total*                             | 55,969  | 149,899     |\n\nThe Group applies the exemptions provided by IFRS 16 for leases with terms ending within 12 months from the date of initial application and the exemption for leases where the underlying asset is of low value. Lease obligations not recognized in the balance sheet due to this application relief amounted to € 1,668k as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 4,539k). In addition to the above amounts, cash outflows of € 9,311k result from leases that had not yet commenced as at the end of the reporting period, which are spread over the following ten years.\n\nAs part of the MBA MVNO agreement with Telefónica, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG made a binding purchase of network capacity consisting of data volume as well as voice and SMS contingents for the term of the contract until July 2025. The capacity to be purchased under the terms of the MBA MVNO agreement represents 20% to 30% of the used capacity of the Telefónica network. Following the conclusion of the MBA MVNO agreement, 1&1 is able to decrease or increase the acquired contingents to a defined extent on a quarterly basis. The payments for the service components of the agreement amount to a mid-three-digit million amount per year. An exact amount cannot be determined because the payments depend on various contractual variables, as well as any future decrease or increase of capacities. From summer 2024, 1&1 will use national roaming from Vodafone as planned and gradually reduce its advance services from Telefónica Germany.\n\nOn September 5, 2019, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG signed an agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) and the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) regarding the construction of mobile communication sites in so-called \"not-spots\". As a result, 1&1 is committed to make total investments of € 50m. 1&1 is thus helping to close existing supply \n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\ngaps and improve the provision of mobile communications in rural regions by building base stations. These commitments are not included in the other commitments listed above as they are interest-like in nature.\n\n# 46. Statement of cash flows\n\nIncome tax payments in fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 267.1m (prior year: € 287.5m), while income tax proceeds totaled € 26.6m (prior year: 22.8m).\n\nCash and cash equivalents do not include amounts which are only usable under certain conditions (prior year: € 0k).\n\n| Reconciliation of balance sheet changes in liabilities from financial activities: |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n|                                                                                   |  |\n\n|                                             | Jan. 01,<br>2023    | cash transactions |                      | non-cash transactions             |                      |                                   | Dec. 31, 2023       |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | Carrying<br>amounts | Redemption        | Interest<br>payments | Borrowings<br>from<br>liabilities | Interest<br>expenses | Transfers<br>and other<br>changes | Carrying<br>amounts |\n| Non-current loan liabilities                | 1,498.8             | -400.0            | 0.0                  | 1,012.0                           | 0.0                  | -229.0                            | 1,881.8             |\n| Short-term loan liabilities                 | 656.7               | -382.0            | -65.0                | 75.0                              | 66.8                 | 230.4                             | 581.9               |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 646.9               | -121.3            | -21.4                | 271.6                             | 21.3                 | 0.0                               | 797.2               |\n| Spectrum liabilities                        | 825.0               | -61.3             | 0.0                  | 0.0                               | 6.1                  | -6.1                              | 763.0               |\n| Total liabilities from financing activities | 3,627.4             | -964.6            | -86.4                | 1,358.6                           | 94.2                 | -4.7                              | 4,024.6             |\n\n|                                             | Jan. 1, 2022        |            | cash transactions    |                                   | non-cash transactions | Dec. 31, 2022                     |                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | Carrying<br>amounts | Redemption | Interest<br>payments | Borrowings<br>from<br>liabilities | Interest<br>expenses  | Transfers<br>and other<br>changes | Carrying<br>amounts |\n| Non-current loan liabilities                | 1,497.2             | 0.0        | 0.0                  | 300.0                             | 0.0                   | -298.4                            | 1,498.8             |\n| Short-term loan liabilities                 | 325.4               | -367.5     | -18.3                | 400.3                             | 18.5                  | 298.4                             | 656.7               |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 515.2               | -112.5     | -11.9                | 244.2                             | 11.9                  | 0.0                               | 646.9               |\n| Spectrum liabilities                        | 886.3               | -61.3      | 0.0                  | 0.0                               | 6.5                   | -6.5                              | 825.0               |\n| Total liabilities from financing activities | 3,224.1             | -541.3     | -30.2                | 944.5                             | 36.9                  | -6.5                              | 3,627.4             |\n\nInitial recognition of the 5G spectrum in the fiscal year 2019 was made against the background of the deferral and installment payment agreed with the German government, extending the balance sheet and thus neutralizing cash flow. Leases are always recognized directly in equity upon initial recognition. Current payments include interest and repayment components and are reported in cash flow from financing activities.\n\nCash flows in connection with the change in other financial liabilities of € 111.8m (prior year: € 123.5m) are recognized in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nCash inflows and outflows from/to minority shareholders mainly relate to cash inflows in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE amounting to € 291.8m and related costs of € 3.1m.\n\nIn addition, there was a cash inflow of € 17.1m from a subsequent purchase price adjustment in connection with the partial exit of Warburg Pincus as part of the IPO.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Change in the presentation of the cash flow statement**\n\n \n\nIn order to reconcile EBITDA and free cash flow more effectively, the Group has adjusted interest payments in cash flow and no longer discloses them in operating activities, but in cash flow from financing activities. As interest expense is not included in EBITDA – which serves as a measure of operating profit and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization – the inclusion of interest payments in operating cash flow may distort the presentation of the actual operating performance.\n\nBy transferring interest payments to cash flow from financing activities, the Company's financial result can be presented more accurately and with greater consistency between EBITDA and free cash flow. Moreover, the interest portion of the repayments of lease liabilities has been eliminated, thus enabling the entire outflow of interest payments to be presented in one line.\n\nAs a result, this measure contributes to a more transparent presentation of the Company's financial performance and clarifies the Company's ability to repay its debts. Moreover, it allows a (more) transparent and (more) comparable presentation of cash flow, thus giving investors and other stakeholders a better understanding of the Company's financial performance.\n\nThe resulting effect on presentation in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 is presented below:\n\n| in € million                        | 2023  |      | 2022 |      |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|------|------|------|\n|                                     | new   | old  | new  | old  |\n| Operative cash flow                 | 1,018 | 946  | 1011 | 992  |\n| Cash flow from investing activities | -798  | -800 | -702 | -704 |\n| Cash flow from financing activities | -44   | 30   | 14   | 35   |\n\n# 47.

In addition, we have audited the Group Management Report of United Internet AG, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n#### *Basis for the Audit Opinions*\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German\n\n252\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\ncommercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\n#### *Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements*\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- Appropriateness of revenue recognition\n- Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use (spectrum)\n- Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n- Matter and issue\n- Audit approach and findings\n- Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### Appropriateness of revenue recognition\n\n In the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG, revenue (sales) of EUR 6,213.2 million is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. This significant item in terms of its amount is subject to particular risk due to the complexity of the processes and controls necessary for correct recognition and deferral, the impact of ever-changing business, price and tariff models (including tariff structures, customer discounts, incentives), and the existence of multiple-element arrangements.\n\nIn addition, the accounting standard applicable to revenue recognition, IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15), requires estimates and judgments in certain areas – such as determining the transaction price and allocating it to the performance obligations identified in a multiple-element arrangement based on the relative stand-alone selling prices – that had to be assessed for appropriateness in the context of our audit. Against this background, the accounting treatment of revenue was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\nIn the knowledge that the complex nature of this matter and the need to make estimates and assumptions give rise to an increased risk of accounting misstatements, as part of our audit we began by assessing the processes and controls put in place by the Group, including the IT systems used for the purposes of revenue recognition. In particular, we assessed the IT system environment \n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor billing and measurement, other relevant systems supporting the accounting treatment of revenue, and the billing and measurement systems right up to entries in the general ledger.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the transaction prices to be determined based on contracts with customers and their allocation to the performance obligations identified in a multiple-element arrangement on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices, and assessed whether these obligations were satisfied over time or at a point in time. In this context, we also assessed the appropriateness of the procedure used to allocate revenue to the correct period, and the estimates and judgments made by the executive directors with respect to revenue recognition and accrual/deferral. We took account of the increased inherent risk in the case of manual entries, in particular by performing additional analytical audit procedures, for instance by means of time series analyses or by forming ratios. Furthermore, we assessed the accounting consequences of new business, price and tariff models and the appropriateness of the associated changes to the processes and IT systems used for the purposes of revenue recognition. We examined customer invoices and the related contracts, as well as payments received on a test basis for selected companies and revenue streams. We applied consistent audit procedures for the audit of the operating subsidiaries to ensure that we responded appropriately throughout the Group to the inherent audit risk relating to revenue recognition.\n\nWe were able to satisfy ourselves that the systems, processes and controls in place are appropriate and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with respect to revenue recognition are sufficiently documented and substantiated to ensure that revenue is properly accounted for.\n\nThe Company's disclosures relating to revenue recognition in the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG are contained in the sections \"2.1 Explanation of main accounting measurement policies\", \"3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\" and \"5. Sales revenue/segment reporting\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use (spectrum)\n\n Non-current assets amounting in total to EUR 9,405.6 million are reported in the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG. Goodwill amounting in total to EUR 3,628.8 million (32.3% of total assets or 65.3% % of equity) is reported under the \"Goodwill\" balance sheet item. Furthermore, intangible assets (spectrum) amounting to EUR 1,069.7 million (10.3% of total assets or 20.2% of equity) are reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item that, in part, are not yet available for use and thus not subject to amortization (hereinafter \"intangible assets (spectrum)\").\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets (spectrum) are tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any need for write-downs. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the respective cash-generating units to which the goodwill or intangible assets (spectrum) are allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating unit, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal in the case of the cash-generating units of the Business Applications and Consumer Applications segments, and using the value in use for the \"1&1 Consumer Access\" (goodwill) and \"1&1 Mobile Network\" (intangible assets (spectrum)) cash-generating units in the Consumer Access segment. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cashgenerating unit normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted budget of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about the Group's medium term business\n\n254\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\ndevelopment and long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating unit. The impairment tests on goodwill and on intangible assets (spectrum) determined that no writedowns were necessary in financial year 2023.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment tests is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rates of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuations, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash flows used for the calculation against the adopted budget and the medium-term business plan of the Group prepared on this basis, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied and the growth rates can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate and the growth rates applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company. We verified that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes relating to cashgenerating units for which a reasonably possible change in an assumption would result in the recoverable amount falling below the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including the allocated goodwill or intangible assets (spectrum).\n\nOverall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures relating to the \"Goodwill\" balance sheet item and to intangible assets (spectrum) are contained in the sections \"2.1 Explanation of main accounting measurement policies\", \"3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\", \"27. Intangible assets (without goodwill)\", \"28. Goodwill\" and \"29. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as intangible assets not yet usable (spectrum licenses)\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Other Information*\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\n- the section \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" of the group management report\n- the disclosures marked as unaudited in sections \"2.2 Business development\", \"2.3 Position of the Group\" and \"5. Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report\n- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB included in section \"7. Corporate governance declaration\" of the group management report\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\nthe separate non-financial group report to comply with §§ 315b to 315c HGB\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n all remaining parts of the annual report – excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## *Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial* Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n256\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and supplementary compliance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this Group Management Report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the Group Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the Group Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### **OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n#### **Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a** HGB\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file unitedinternetag\\_KA\\_ZLB\\_2023-12- 31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").

Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1 (09.2022)).\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. [number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material noncompliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error.

We were engaged by the supervisory board on 12 October 2023. We have been the group auditor of the United Internet AG, Montabaur, without interruption since the financial year 2022.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n## **REFERENCE TO AN OTHER MATTER– USE OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT**\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited Group Management Report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited Group Management Report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n## **GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT**\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Erik Hönig.\n\nDüsseldorf, March 19, 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nErik Hönig Christian David Simon Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüfer\n\n[German Public Auditor] [German Public Auditor]\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\n# RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the Group, and the Management Report and Group Management Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.\n\nMontabaur, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nRalph Dommermuth Ralf Hartings Markus Huhn\n\nh.S.Ch\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **United Internet AG**\n\nElgendorfer Straße 57 56410 Montabaur Germany\n\nwww.united-internet.com",

Moreover, certain information may not be verifiable by the auditor: such \"non-auditable information\" cannot be assessed by the auditor due to the nature of the disclosures or the absence of suitable criteria.\n\nIn the Combined Management Report of United Internet AG for the Company and the Group as of December 31, 2023, the following chapters or disclosures were identified as \"non-audited management report disclosures\":\n\n- The disclosures made in the subsection \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" are \"nonaudited management report disclosures\", as the content of \"non-management report-related disclosures\" is not audited.\n- The \"quarterly development\" tables contained in the subsections \"2.2 Business development\" and \"2.3 Position of the Group\" with key financial figures on a quarterly basis for the segments and the Group are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as United Internet does not subject its Interim Financial Statements to a review or audit. The quarterly figures are marked accordingly as \"unaudited\".\n- The German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") recommends disclosures on the internal control and risk management system. These go beyond the statutory requirements for the management report and are not included in the auditor's review of the content of the management report (\"non-management report-related disclosures\"). In chapter 5 \"Internal control and risk management system\", they are thematically assigned to the main elements of the internal control and risk management system and are separated from the disclosures to be audited by separate paragraphs and marked accordingly as \"unaudited\".\n- The disclosures made in chapter \"7. Declaration on Company Management\" are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as an audit of the disclosures contained in the Declaration on Company Management in accordance with section 317 (2) sentence 6 German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB) is limited to the fact that the information has been provided and the Corporate Governance Report in chapter 7 constitutes a \"non-management report-related disclosure\" which is not subject to a substantive audit.\n\n# General notes\n\n- Due to calculation processes, tables and references may produce rounding differences from the mathematically exact values (monetary units, percentage statements, etc.).\n- For reasons of better readability, the additional use of the female form is omitted in this report. United Internet would like to stress that the use of the masculine form is to be understood purely as the gender-neutral form.\n- These Annual Financial Statements are available in German and English. Both versions can also be downloaded at www.united-internet.de. In all cases of doubt, the German version shall prevail.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1. GROUP AND COMPANY PROFILE\n\n# 1.1 Business model\n\n# Group structure\n\n4\n\nFounded in 1998 and based in Montabaur, Germany, United Internet AG is the parent company (hereinafter also referred to as \"the Company\") of the United Internet Group.\n\nTogether with its service company United Internet Corporate Services GmbH, United Internet AG focuses mainly on centralized functions in the areas of Finance, Corporate Controlling & Accounting, Tax, Investment Management, Press Relations, Investor Relations, Legal, Corporate Governance, Compliance & Sustainability, Risk Management, Corporate Audit, HR Management, Facility Management, Procurement, and Corporate IT.\n\nCompared to the previous year, the Group structure as of December 31, 2023 is largely unchanged from the previous year.\n\nOperating activities in the Consumer Access segment are mainly managed by the companies Drillisch Online GmbH and 1&1 Telecom GmbH under the umbrella of 1&1 AG.\n\nIn its Business Access segment, United Internet mainly operates via 1&1 Versatel Germany GmbH, held by 1&1 Versatel GmbH.\n\nOperating activities in the Consumer Applications segment are primarily managed via the companies 1&1 Mail & Media GmbH, 1&1 Mail & Media Inc., and United Internet Media GmbH, pooled together under 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE.\n\nIn its Business Applications segment, United Internet is primarily active via its shares in STRATO AG and its subsidiary Cronon GmbH – held by the holding companies IONOS Group SE and IONOS Holding SE – as well as in IONOS SE and its main domestic and foreign subsidiaries. These include - in addition to the foreign subsidiaries IONOS Inc. (USA), IONOS Cloud Ltd. (UK), IONOS S.A.R.L. (France), and IONOS Cloud S.L.U. (Spain) - in particular Arsys Internet S.L.U. (Spain), Fasthosts Internet Ltd. (UK), home.pl S.A. (Poland), InterNetX GmbH, Sedo GmbH, united-domains AG, we22 GmbH, and World4You Internet Services GmbH (Austria).\n\nIn addition to these operating and fully consolidated subsidiaries, United Internet held a number of other investments as of December 31, 2023. These mainly consist of equity interests – held by United Internet Investments Holding AG & Co. KG – in Kublai GmbH, Frankfurt am Main (40.00%), which in turn holds 95.39% of shares in Tele Columbus AG, Berlin, and investments in the strategic partners Open-Xchange AG, Cologne (25.39%), rankingCoach International GmbH, Cologne (31.52%), uberall GmbH, Berlin (25.10%), and AWIN AG, Berlin (20.00%), as well as the investment in Stackable GmbH, Pinneberg (25.10%) held by IONOS SE.\n\nFurther details on these investments and changes in investments are provided in chapter 2.2 \"Business development\" under \"Group investments\".\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nA simplified illustration of the Group structure of United Internet with its significant operating subsidiaries and investments - as of December 31, 2023 - is shown in the following chart.\n\n5\n\nUnited Internet AG\n\n| 1&1 AG (78.32%)                                        |                              |               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|\n| Drillisch Online (100%)                                |                              |               |\n| 1&1 Telecommunication (100%)                           |                              |               |\n| 1&1 Telecom (100%)                                     |                              |               |\n| 1&1 Versatel GmbH (100%)                               |                              |               |\n| 1&1 Versatel Deutschland (100%)                        |                              |               |\n| 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE (100%)                |                              |               |\n| 1&1 De-Mail (100%)                                     | 1&1 Mail & Media (100%)      |               |\n| 1&1 Energy (100%)                                      | United Internet Media (100%) |               |\n| IONOS Group SE (63.84%)                                |                              |               |\n| IONOS Holding SE (100%)                                |                              |               |\n| IONOS (100%)                                           | STRATO (100%)                |               |\n| IONOS USA (100%)                                       | InterNetX (100%)             | Cronon (100%) |\n| IONOS UK (100%)                                        | Sedo (100%)                  |               |\n| IONOS FR (100%)                                        | united-domains (100%)        |               |\n| IONOS ES (100%)                                        | we22 (100%)                  |               |\n| Arsys (100%)                                           | World4You (100%)             |               |\n| Fasthosts (100%)                                       | Stackable (25.10%)           |               |\n| home.pl (100%)                                         |                              |               |\n| United Internet Investments Holding AG & Co.

In the case of business with ADSL connections (currently being phased out), further advance service providers are used.\n\nUnited Internet is also one of the leading providers of mobile internet products in Germany.\n\nSince the launch of mobile services on December 8, 2023, 1&1's mobile communications network has been fully operational. Wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient mobile coverage during its years of network expansion, it uses national roaming. This is currently provided by Telefónica and as of summer 2024 national roaming services are to be procured from Vodafone. National roaming is a standard procedure used in the rollout of new mobile networks that enables customers to surf and make calls without interruption in areas not yet covered. This is achieved by automatically using the roaming partner's antennas in these areas.\n\nUntil 1&1 has migrated its more than 12 million existing customers to its own 1&1 mobile network, it will also use the Telefónica mobile network as a so-called Mobile Bitstream Access Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MBA MVNO), as well as MVNO capacities of Vodafone. As of the beginning of 2024, existing MVNO customers are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network.\n\nMobile internet products are marketed via the premium brand 1&1 as well as via discount brands, such as winSIM and sim.de.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Access segment**\n\nIn its Business Access segment, United Internet offers a wide range of telecommunication products and services for business customers via 1&1 Versatel.\n\nThe core of this business model is the operation of a modern fiber-optic network with a length of over 61,000 km, which is one of the largest networks in Germany and is constantly being expanded.\n\n1&1 Versatel uses this network to offer telecommunication products – from standardized fiber-optic direct connections to tailored ICT solutions (voice, data and network solutions) – to companies and local authorities. In addition, the 1&1 fiber-optic network is offered for infrastructure services (wholesale) to national and international carriers.\n\n## **Consumer Applications segment**\n\nApplications for home users are pooled in the Consumer Applications segment. In particular, these applications include Personal Information Management applications (e-mail, to-do lists, appointments, addresses), and online storage (cloud), as well as domains, website solutions tailored to consumer needs, and office software.\n\nIn the course of portfolio development over the past few years, the GMX and WEB.DE brands have been expanded from pure e-mail service providers to complete command centers for the communication, information, and identity management needs of users.\n\nApplications for home users are nearly all developed in-house and operated at the Group's own data centers. Products are offered as fee-based subscriptions (pay accounts) or - for free - in the form of ad-financed accounts (free accounts). Online advertising is marketed by United Internet Media.\n\nWith its GMX and WEB.DE brands, United Internet operates primarily in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where it is among the leading players.\n\nSince the acquisition of the US provider mail.com, United Internet has also been driving its international expansion in this segment. In addition to the USA, mail.com targets other countries, such as the UK, France, and Spain.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the Business Applications segment, United Internet opens up online business opportunities for freelancers and SMEs, helping them digitize their processes. This involves offering a broad range of products, such as domains, websites, web hosting, servers and e-shops, group work, online storage (cloud), and office software, which customers use via subscription agreements. In addition, cloud solutions and cloud infrastructure are offered.\n\nThe applications are developed at in-house development centers or in cooperation with partner firms and operated on over 100,000 servers at 11 own data centers and 21 co-locations.\n\nIn its Business Applications segment, United Internet is also a leading global player with activities in Europe (Germany, France, the UK, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Sweden) as well as in North America (the USA, Canada, Mexico).\n\nBusiness applications are marketed to specific target groups via differently positioned brands, such as IONOS, Strato, Fasthosts, Arsys, home.pl, InterNetX, united-domains, and World4You.

With the fiber-optic network of 1&1 Versatel spanning over 61,000 km, United Internet operates one of Germany's largest fiber-optic networks.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Consumer Applications segment**\n\nIn its Consumer Applications segment, United Internet operates in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria via the GMX and WEB.DE brands, as well as in countries such as the USA, UK, France, and Spain via the international brand mail.com. United Internet is the leading provider of e-mail services and one of the leaders in cloud services in its domestic German market – based on the number of users.\n\n## **Competitive standing in the Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the globally aligned Business Applications segment, United Internet is active in a total of 18 countries with its hosting and cloud applications. The Company has long been the market leader in the German hosting business – based on the number of managed country domains – and strengthened its position in 2017 with the takeover of its competitor STRATO. In other European countries, United Internet's hosting applications are now available in all major markets – either locally or from Germany. In addition to the domestic German market, these mainly include the major European economies of France, the UK, Italy, Poland, and Spain. With the exception of Italy, the Company is among the market leaders –\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeasured by the number of managed country domains – in the aforementioned countries. All in all, therefore, United Internet is also one of the leading European suppliers of hosting applications – based on the number of managed country domains. Further target markets outside Europe are the North American countries Canada, USA, and Mexico. In the most important of these markets, the USA, United Internet is also one of the leading players in this segment – based on the number of managed country domains.\n\nFrom a global perspective, United Internet is thus also one of the leading companies in the hosting business.\n\n# Main locations\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the United Internet Group employed a total of 10,962 people worldwide at around 40 domestic and foreign facilities.\n\n| Location                                        | Segment               | Main Company                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Montabaur (HQ)                                  | Corporate functions   | United Internet               |\n|                                                 | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n| Karlsruhe                                       | Corporate functions   | United Internet               |\n|                                                 | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Consumer Applications | 1&1 Mail & Media Applications |\n|                                                 | Business Applications | IONOS                         |\n| Berlin                                          | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Business Access       | 1&1 Versatel                  |\n|                                                 | Business Applications | IONOS, Strato, we22           |\n| Dusseldorf                                      | Consumer Access       | 1&1                           |\n|                                                 | Business Access       | 1&1 Versatel                  |\n| Cebu City (Philippines)                         | Business Applications | IONOS                         |\n| Madrid / Logroño / Barcelona / Lugo ...

Such a business model ensures generally stable and plannable revenue and cash flows, protects against macroeconomic effects, and provides the financial scope to grasp opportunities in new or extended business fields and new or extended markets – organically, or via acquisitions and investments.\n\nThe large number of customer relationships helps the Company to utilize so-called economies of scale: the more customers using the products created by its development teams and operated at its own data centers, and/or transport data via its own networks, the greater the profit will be. These profits can then be invested in new customers, new developments, and new or extended business fields.\n\nFrom the current perspective, Cloud Applications and Mobile Internet will be the growth markets over the coming years. With its clear positioning in the Access and Applications segments, United Internet is well placed to exploit the expected market potential.\n\nIn view of the dynamic market development of Cloud Applications and Mobile Internet, the Company's growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. These internet-based programs for private users and companies will also be United Internet's growth drivers in the years ahead – both as stand-alone products in the Applications division, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in the Access division.\n\nWith its many years of experience as an access and application provider, its expertise in software development and data center operation, marketing, sales and customer support, as well as its strong and well-known brands (such as 1&1, GMX and WEB.DE), and customer relationships with millions of private users, freelancers, and small companies in Germany and abroad (currently over 68 million user accounts worldwide), the Company is excellently positioned.\n\nIn order to leverage this positioning for further sustainable growth, United Internet will continue to invest heavily in new customers, new products, and new or extended business fields, as well as in its further internationalization.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, United Internet also continuously seeks possibilities for company acquisitions, investments, and partnerships in order to extend its market positions, vertical integration levels, and expertise.\n\nThanks to its high and plannable level of free cash flow, United Internet has a strong source of internal funding as well as good access to debt financing markets. Further information on the Company's equity strength and external financing is presented in the chapters 2.2 \"Business development\" and 2.3 \"Position of the Group\".\n\nFurther information on strategy, opportunities and targets is included in the \"Risk, Opportunity and Forecast Report\" in chapter 4.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.3 Management systems\n\nThe internal management systems help the management team steer and monitor the Group and its segments. The systems consist of planning, actual situation, and forecast calculations based on the Group's annually revised strategic planning. Particular attention is paid to market developments, technological developments, and trends, as well as their impact on the Group's own products and services, and the Group's financial possibilities. The corporate management system's aim is the continuous and sustainable development of United Internet and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's reporting system comprises the monthly profit calculations and quarterly IFRS-compliant reports for all consolidated subsidiaries. It presents the financial position and performance of the Group and all divisions. Financial reporting also includes other detailed information which is required for the assessment and control of the operating business.\n\nQuarterly reports on significant risks for the Company represent a further component of the management systems.\n\nThe above mentioned reports are discussed at meetings of the Management Board and Supervisory Board and provide the fundamental basis for assessments and decisions.\n\nIn order to steer the Group's performance, United Internet AG uses in particular the key figures of the income statement (sales, EBITDA, EBIT, EPS), of the statement of cash flows (free cash flow), and of the statement of financial position (asset items, financial liabilities).\n\nInformation on the use and definition of the relevant key financial figures is presented in chapter 2.2 \"Business development\".\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG steers the segments mainly on the basis of key performance figures. It measures the success of each segment primarily according to sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).\n\nThe main non-financial key figures used are the number and growth of fee-based customer contracts, as well as ad-financed free accounts.\n\nThe performance indicators of the United Internet Group for top management are also presented in \"Segment reporting\" under note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) used by top management at Group level are sales and operating (i.e., adjusted for special items) EBITDA according to IFRS. These figures are also used in forecast reporting.\n\nDue to its role as the holding company, United Internet AG (parent company) is mainly influenced by its investment result (profit transfers and dividends) and interest result and therefore focuses on its investment result and net income.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of customer contracts, the gross and net sales figures, and the related customer acquisition costs in particular - compared to the Company's plans and forecast calculations - serve as an early warning system.\n\nThe KPIs used in the fiscal year 2023 were unchanged from the previous year.\n\nA comparison of the KPIs stated in the forecast and the actual figures is provided in this Management Report in chapter 2.2 \"Business Development\" in the section \"Actual and Forecast Development\".\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\n\nThe disclosures made in the subsection \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" are \"nonaudited management report disclosures\", as the content of \"non-management report-related disclosures\" is not audited. \n\nAs an internet service provider, the United Internet Group does not engage in research and development (R&D) on a scale comparable with manufacturing companies. Also within the context of its own sector, research and development expenditures play a fairly subordinate role. Against this backdrop, United Internet does not disclose key figures for R&D.\n\nAt the same time, the United Internet brands stand for high-performance internet access, solutions, and innovative web-based products and applications which are mostly developed in-house. The success of United Internet is rooted in an ability to develop, combine, or adapt innovative products and services, and launch them on major markets.\n\nThanks to its high-performance development centers (especially in Karlsruhe, Berlin, and Bucharest) with around 3,800 programmers, product managers, and technical administrators (corresponding to around 35% of all employees), United Internet is able to react swiftly and flexibly to new ideas and trends, and to continuously enhance its established products by adapting them to changing market needs – a key success factor in the fast-moving internet market. The Company's expertise in product development, enhancement, and rollout minimizes its reliance on third party development work and supplies in many areas, and thus ensures decisive competitive and time-to-market advantages.\n\nDue to the steady growth in customer figures, the demands placed on reliability and availability are constantly rising. In addition to the further development of existing products and continuous optimization of back-end operations, the Company also focuses on continuously enhancing existing processes in order to raise system reliability, and thus also customer satisfaction.\n\n# Focus areas 2023\n\n## **Consumer Access**\n\n- With the launch of mobile services in 1&1's mobile network in December 2023, 1&1 established the key prerequisites for extending its vertical integration in this market segment – as in the landline segment; 1&1 has since been producing advance services for new customers in its own network; wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient network coverage during the network rollout, it uses the national roaming advance services of Telefónica and, from summer 2024, of Vodafone; as of the beginning of 2024, existing 1&1 customers on third-party networks are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network.\n- Extension of \"1&1 5G at home\" with addition of conventional telephony, making it a complete replacement for DSL, cable or fiber-optic home connections\n- Simplification of process for multiple orders of mobile products from business customers\n- Implementation and start-up of a new omnichannel platform (Customer Operations)\n- Process enhancements and implementations in connection with the German Telecommunications Modernization Act (TKMoG)\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Extensive enhancements and improvements to fiber-optic customer communication and optimization of customer processes\n- Implementation and launch of 1&1 Cinema as a video-on-demand service; usage via TV app or together with IPTV\n- Expansion of products, ordering options and services for business customers\n- Standardization of order communication: platform for text-based order communication was revamped and standardized; to improve comprehensibility, customers now receive all order documents in a standardized form and based on the shopping cart display\n- Creation of a new platform for landline products at Drillisch Online\n\n## **Business Access**\n\n- Launch of Cloud PBX product \"1&1 Business Phone\" in cooperation with NFON\n- Introduction of \"1&1 Fiber Connect Basic\" product for smart clusters in business parks\n- \"1&1 Connected Calls for MS Teams\" as a simple telephone system and access to the public telephone network with Microsoft Teams\n- Expansion of the \"1&1 Business Phone\" product to include hospitality as a cloud PBX industry solution for the hospitality and trade sectors\n- Launch of an internet product for customer locations abroad\n- Implementation of a multichannel order management system for fully digitalized order entry across all sales segments\n- Extensive expansion and optimization of customer processes\n- Integration of further advance service products to increase the fiber-optic footprint in Germany\n\n## **Consumer Applications**\n\n- Launch of \"United Internet Media Ad Manager\" to improve internal and external control and creation of online campaigns\n- Implementation of a modern Customer Care Suite for the GMX and WEB.DE brands that raises degree of automation in processing and can be flexibly adapted\n- Expansion of upselling order lines in mobile applications to effectively support sales campaigns\n- Launch of a new e-mail web client (read use case) for GMX and WEB.DE\n- Extension of the AI-based categorized mail inbox (One Inbox)\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Launch of \"Account Recovery Assistant\" that provides customers with highly automated support in the event of access problems\n- Implementation of \"Effective Settings\", a centralized high-load platform for applying business rules to products and advertising across the company, based on consent, contract data, and legal frameworks\n- Conversion of the cashback platform from WebCents to EUR cents and addition of a credit card that users can also use offline to collect cents\n- Optimization of advertising by using AI to calculate prospecting scores\n- Launch of a lead generation system to enable customers to sign up for new newsletters from their inbox\n\n## **Business Applications**\n\n- Extension of \"Database-as-a-Service\" with MongoDB as document-based NoSQL database\n- Replacement of HDD storage with SSD products for higher storage performance, efficiency and packing density\n- Extension of Virtual Network Services with Managed NAT Gateway, Managed Network Load Balancer, Managed Application Load Balancer and Cloud DNS\n- Launch of IPv6 in native network stack\n- Launch of open source solution \"Managed Stackable\" (by IONOS and Stackable) as first Managed Big Data product\n- Launch of STRATO Virtual Dedicated Server based on IONOS Cloud Compute\n- Launch of STRATO V-Server based on IONOS Cloud (CoreVPS/Cubes)\n- Launch of HiDrive4You as new STRATO cloud storage tariff\n- Introduction of AI solutions in website builder and domain search\n- Launch of virtual CPUs as new compute type\n- Introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as first commercial Linux operating system\n- Launch of new platform services: Private Node Pools for Managed Kubernetes, Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning, and Logging-as-a-Service\n- Launch of a new managed server generation based on Alma Linux at STRATO\n- Introduction of ServerGuard24 for STRATO server products\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2. ECONOMIC REPORT\n\n# 2.1 General economic and sector conditions\n\n# General economic development\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for 2023 slightly during the course of the year. In its latest economic outlook (World Economic Outlook, Update January 2024), the IMF reported growth of 3.1% for the global economy in 2023, based on preliminary calculations. Growth was thus below the prior-year level (3.5%) but at the same time 0.2 percentage points above the IMF's original outlook of January 2023 (2.9%).\n\nIn the United Internet Group's target markets in North America, growth rates varied somewhat. The IMF anticipates growth of 2.5% for the USA (prior year: 1.9%), and thus 1.1 percentage points more than in its January outlook for 2023 (1.4%). However, the calculated growth of 1.1% for Canada (prior year: 3.8%) is 0.4 percentage points less than originally expected (1.5%). And for Mexico, the IMF forecasts an increase in economic output of 3.4% (prior year: 3.9%), and thus 1.7 percentage points more than anticipated at the beginning of the year (1.7%).\n\nThe picture is much gloomier in the eurozone region, where all countries of importance for United Internet displayed much weaker growth than in 2022. The IMF now expects overall growth of 0.5% (prior year: 3.4%) for the eurozone and thus a further 0.2 percentage points less than it forecast in January (0.7%). Growth of 0.8% was calculated for France (prior year: 2.5%), 0.7% for Italy (prior year: 3.7%), and 2.4% for Spain (prior year: 5.8%). This corresponds to an improvement of 0.1 percentage points each for France and Italy, and 1.3 percentage points for Spain, compared to the January outlook (France: 0.7%; Italy: 0.6%; Spain: 1.1%). And for Poland, the IMF expects growth of 0.6% (prior year: 5.3%).\n\nFor the UK, a non-EU country, the IMF expects growth of 0.5% (prior year: 4.3%), and thus 1.1 percentage point more than at the beginning of the year (-0.6%).\n\nThe economic development in Germany – United Internet's most important market by far (sales share 2023: around 89%) – was much slower than in the previous year and also below the IMF's original expectations. The IMF has calculated that economic output in Germany decreased by -0.3% (prior year: 1.8%) and was thus a further -0.4 percentage points below expectations at the beginning of the year (0.1%).\n\nThe IMF's calculations for Germany are therefore in line with the preliminary figures of the country's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), which – at its \"GDP 2023\" press conference on January 15, 2024 – also announced a decline in (price-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) of -0.3% for 2023. This is 2.1 percentage points less than in 2022 (1.8%). According to the Federal Statistical Office, this was due to further inflation-related high prices throughout the economy, unfavorable borrowing conditions caused by rising interest rates and an overall decline in both domestic and foreign demand.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n|          | January<br>forecast<br>2023 | April<br>forecast<br>2023 | July<br>forecast<br>2023 | October<br>forecast<br>2023 | Actual<br>2023 | Change on<br>January forecast |\n|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| World    | 2.9%                        | 2.8%                      | 3.0%                     | 3.0%                        | 3.1%           | +0.2%-points                  |\n| USA      | 1.4%                        | 1.6%                      | 1.8%                     | 2.1%                        | 2.5%           | +1.1%-points                  |\n| Canada   | 1.5%                        | 1.5%                      | 1.7%                     | 1.3%                        | 1.1%           | -0.4%-points                  |\n| Mexico   | 1.7%                        | 1.8%                      | 2.6%                     | 3.2%                        | 3.4%           | +1.7%-points                  |\n| Eurozone | 0.7%                        | 0.8%                      | 0.9%                     | 0.7%                        | 0.5%           | -0.2%-points                  |\n| France   | 0.7%                        | 0.7%                      | 0.8%                     | 1.0%                        | 0.8%           | +0.1%-points                  |\n| Spain    | 1.1%                        | 1.5%                      | 2.5%                     | 2.5%                        | 2.4%           | +1.3%-points                  |\n| Italy    | 0.6%                        | 0.7%                      | 1.1%                     | 0.7%                        | 0.7%           | +0.1%-points                  |\n| UK       | -0.6%                       | -0.3%                     | 0.4%                     | 0.5%                        | 0.5%           | +1.1%-points                  |\n| Germany  | 0.1%                        | -0.1%                     | -0.3%                    | -0.5%                       | -0.3%          | -0.4%-points                  |\n\n#### **Changes in growth forecasts made during 2023 for United Internet's key target countries and regions**\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2023, April 2023, July 2023, October 2023 and January 2024\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: GDP trend in United Internet's key target countries and regions**\n\n|          | 2019  | 2020   | 2021 | 2022 | 2023  | YoY change   |\n|----------|-------|--------|------|------|-------|--------------|\n| World    | 2.8%  | -3.1%  | 6.2% | 3.5% | 3.1%  | -0.4%-points |\n| USA      | 2.2%  | -3.4%  | 5.9% | 1.9% | 2.5%  | +0.6%-points |\n| Canada   | 1.9%  | -5.2%  | 5.0% | 3.8% | 1.1%  | -2.7%-points |\n| Mexico   | -0.1% | -8.2%  | 4.7% | 3.9% | 3.4%  | -0.5%-points |\n| Eurozone | 1.3%  | -6.4%  | 5.3% | 3.4% | 0.5%  | -2.9%-points |\n| France   | 1.5%  | -8.0%  | 6.8% | 2.5% | 0.8%  | -1.7%-points |\n| Spain    | 2.0%  | -10.8% | 5.5% | 5.8% | 2.4%  | -3.4%-points |\n| Italy    | 0.3%  | -8.9%  | 6.7% | 3.7% | 0.7%  | -3.0%-points |\n| Poland   | 4.4%  | -2.0%  | 6.9% | 5.3% | 0.6%  | -4.7%-points |\n| UK       | 1.4%  | -9.4%  | 7.6% | 4.3% | 0.5%  | -3.8%-points |\n| Germany  | 0.6%  | -4.6%  | 2.6% | 1.8% | -0.3% | -2.1%-points |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of price-adjusted GDP in Germany**\n\n|     | 2019 | 2020  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023  | YoY change   |\n|-----|------|-------|------|------|-------|--------------|\n| GDP | 1.1% | -3.8% | 3.2% | 1.8% | -0.3% | -2.1%-points |\n\nSource: Destatis, January 2024\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Development of sector / core markets\n\nAt its annual press conference on January 10, 2024, the industry association Bitkom assumed growth of 2.0% (prior year: 6.8%) to € 215.0 billion for the German ICT market in 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the association was still anticipating revenue growth of 3.8% for 2023. Nevertheless, the digital sector is proving highly robust once again – despite the adverse macroeconomic environment dominated by geopolitical crises, disrupted supply chains, and skilled labor shortages.\n\nThe increase in the overall ICT market resulted in particular from growth in sales of information technology. According to Bitkom's 2023 forecast, sales in this largest submarket – and of particular importance for United Internet – rose by 2.2% (prior year: 8.7%) to € 142.9 billion, compared to a growth forecast of 6.3% at the beginning of 2023. The various segments of this sub-market made varied progress: software grew by 9.6% (prior year: 15.0%) and IT services by 5.1% (prior year: 8.5%), while IT hardware fell by -5.4% (prior year: 4.8%) following the disproportionately high level of investment during the pandemic.\n\nThere was also good progress in the telecommunications submarket. For this second core market of United Internet, the industry association expects growth in 2023 of 1.7% (prior year: 3.4%) to € 72.1 billion – compared to its forecast at the beginning of 2022 of 0.9%. Growth in the individual segments of the telecommunications market was also quite varied: whereas the infrastructure business (driven by the 5G network rollout) grew by 4.4% (prior year: 14.2%) and telecommunication services by 1.9% (prior year: 2.1%), sales of user devices fell by -0.7% (prior year: 2.4%).\n\nThe smallest sub-market, consumer electronics (of no significance for United Internet), continued its decline and decreased by -2.1% (prior year: -7.2%) to € 8.1 billion.\n\nThe most important ICT markets for United Internet's business model are the German telecommunications market (broadband connections and mobile internet) in its mostly subscriptionfinanced Access division, as well as the global cloud computing market, and the German online advertising market for its subscription- and ad-financed Applications division.\n\n## **(Stationary) broadband market in Germany**\n\nIn view of the high level of household coverage already achieved and the strong trend toward mobile internet usage, demand for new landline-based broadband connections in Germany has slowed in recent years. With expected growth of 0.2 million, or 0.5%, to 37.0 million in 2023, the number of new connections was again at a moderate level. These figures were calculated by the Association of Telecommunications and Value-Added Service Providers (Verband der Anbieter von Telekommunikations- und Mehrwertdiensten – VATM) and Dialog Consult in their joint \"25th TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023\" (November 2023). The connections currently of relevance for United Internet in the two technology fields of DSL and FTTB/FTTH (fiber-optic) performed very differently: whereas DSL connections in Germany fell by 0.4 million to 24.3 million, fiber-optic connections grew by 0.8 million to 4.2 million. The number of cable connections also fell by 0.2 million to 8.5 million.\n\nAccording to estimates of Dialog Consult/VATM, revenues generated in the landline business in 2023 were unchanged from the previous year at € 32.6 billion. In addition to retail sales, these revenue figures also include wholesale, interconnection, and terminal device revenues.\n\nAt the same time, however, calculations of Dialog Consult/VATM indicate that the average volume of data used is rising much more strongly than the number of newly activated connections and landline \n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nrevenues – as an indicator of continued growth in usage of e.g., IPTV and cloud applications – with growth of 16.1% to 320.9 GB (per connection and month).\n\nAs a result, demand for more powerful broadband connections also developed strongly. For example, the proportion of switched broadband connections with (downstream) speeds of at least 50 Mbit/s increased by 3.2 percentage points, from 58.7% in the previous year to 61.9% (of all broadband connections) in 2023. There was even stronger growth in fixed-line connections with speeds of at least 250 Mbit/s, which raised their share by 5.1 percentage points to 23.0% (of all broadband connections).\n\n#### **Key market figures: fixed-line in Germany**\n\n|                                    | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Fixed-line revenues (in € billion) | 32.6 | 32.6 | 0.0%   |\n\nSource: Dialog Consult / VATM, TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023, November 2023\n\n## **Mobile internet market in Germany**\n\nAccording to estimates of Dialog Consult / VATM, the number of active SIM cards in the German mobile communications market increased by 12.9 million, or 7.6%, to 181.9 million in 2023. This growth is attributable to so-called M2M SIM cards (machine-to-machine SIM cards), which are used, for example, for the automated exchange of information between machines, vending machines, vehicles, etc. and/or with a central control station, which increased by 12.0 million to 70.3 million. The number of active personal SIMs (active = used in the last three months) rose only slightly by 0.5 million to 104.9 million – thus indicating a largely saturated market, as the figures for the past few years have shown.\n\nDialog Consult / VATM calculates that total revenues in the German mobile communications market increased by 0.4% from € 27.5 billion to € 27.6 billion in 2023 (including interconnection, wholesale, and user device revenues). Service revenues rose by 1.0% to € 21.1 billion, while other revenues (which include interconnection, wholesale, and user device revenues) decreased by 3.0% to € 6.4 billion.\n\nAccording to forecasts of Dialog Consult/VATM, the average volume of data used (per connection and month) - as an indicator of the growing use of mobile data services - grew much faster than the number of active personal SIM cards and mobile revenues by 22.1% to 6.57 GB.\n\n#### **Key market figures: mobile communications in Germany**\n\n|                                | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Mobile revenues (in € billion) | 27.6 | 27.5 | + 0.4% |\n| thereof service sales          | 21.1 | 20.9 | + 1.0% |\n| thereof other sales            | 6.4  | 6.6  | - 3.0% |\n\nSource: Dialog Consult / VATM, TC Market Analysis for Germany 2023, November 2023\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Global cloud computing market**\n\nThere was further dynamic growth in the cloud computing market in 2023. In its \"Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update\" (November 2023), Gartner Inc. forecasts global growth for public cloud services of 17.8% in 2023, from USD 478.32 billion to USD 563.59 billion.\n\nOver the past years, cloud technology has evolved from a useful and competitive business tool to a key enterprise enabler.\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic conditions and high inflationary pressure, the coronavirus pandemic in particular has accelerated the digitalization process across numerous sectors since 2020. Most companies now regard new technologies as essential tools for coping with the crises. Within just a short period of time, for example, thousands of employees working from home were connected, new digital channels for sales and support were opened, and a large number of systems and data were moved to the cloud.\n\nAs a result, the migration of data, applications, and infrastructure to the cloud has become an integral part of most digital transformation strategies, with the aim of creating more agile and adaptable operations.\n\nGrowth is particularly strong at present in the field of IaaS, as companies accelerate their IT modernization initiatives in order to minimize risks and optimize costs. Moving operations to the cloud reduces current capital expenditures by spreading them over the life of a cloud subscription - a key advantage in an environment where liquidity can be critical to maintaining operations.\n\n| in \\$ billion                                      | 2023   | 2022   | Change  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Global sales of public cloud services              | 563.59 | 478.32 | + 17.8% |\n| thereof Application Infrastructure Services (PaaS) | 145.32 | 119.58 | + 21.5% |\n| thereof Application Services (SaaS)                | 205.22 | 174.42 | + 17.7% |\n| thereof Business Process Services (BPaaS)          | 66.34  | 61.56  | + 7.8%  |\n| thereof Desktop as a Service (DaaS)                | 2.78   | 2.43   | + 14.6% |\n| thereof System Infrastructure Services (IaaS)      | 143.93 | 120.33 | + 19.6% |\n\n#### **Key market figures: cloud computing worldwide**\n\nSource: Gartner, Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update, November 2023\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **German online advertising market**\n\nIn its study \"German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 - 2027\" (September 2023), the auditing and consultancy company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecasts an increase in total revenues (paid search, display, video, affiliate / classifieds) of the German online advertising market (mobile advertising and desktop advertising) of 7.0% from € 12.58 billion to € 13.47 billion for 2023 – following growth of 6.0% in 2022.\n\n| Key market figures: total online advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to PWC |       |       |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| in € billion                                                                                                            | 2023  | 2022  | Change |\n| Online advertising revenues                                                                                             | 13.47 | 12.58 | + 7.0% |\n\nSource: PricewaterhouseCoopers, German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 – 2027, September 2023\n\nThe Online Marketing Group (OVK) of the German Association for the Digital Economy (BVDW) is somewhat more cautious than PwC in its assessment of the situation in the German online advertising market. The OVK only takes net revenues into account in its market figures and focuses on the most important sub-market for United Internet, the display advertising market (mobile and desktop). The definition of the display advertising market comprises in-page advertising, including out-stream advertising and in-stream video advertising. Keyword-based paid search, affiliate or newsletter marketing, advertising for apps in the app store, and in-game advertising, by contrast, are not included in the OVK model.\n\nBased on its updated forecast in September 2023, the OVK anticipates - in its OVK Report 2023/02 an increase in net revenues of the display advertising market from € 5.18 billion in the previous year to € 5.47 billion. This represents an increase of 5.6%, compared to growth of 1.1% in the previous year. In spring 2023, the Online Marketing Group (OVK) had forecast an increase in net revenues of 4.6%.\n\n#### **Key market figures: display advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to OVK**\n\n| in € billion                 | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Display advertising revenues | 5.47 | 5.18 | + 5.6% |\n\nSource: Online-Vermarkterkreis (OVK), OVK-Report 2023/02, September 2023\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Legal conditions / significant events\n\nThe legal parameters for United Internet's business activities remained largely unchanged from the previous year in 2023 and had no significant influence on the development of the United Internet Group.\n\n## **Legal conditions**\n\nOne of the factors determining the future success of United Internet subsidiary 1&1 as a mobile network operator is the future allocation of mobile communication frequencies (spectrum). As part of the German Federal Network Agency's spectrum auction in 2019, 1&1 acquired 5G spectrum in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands. The frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band are already available and are being used for mobile network operations, while the frequencies in the 2 GHz band will be available from 2026. In order to bridge this period, 1&1 has leased further spectrum in the 2.6 GHz band from Telefónica.\n\nIn order to be able to operate its mobile network competitively and efficiently, 1&1 – as well as all other mobile network operators – not only requires high-frequency spectrum but also so-called low-band frequencies, which are essential for indoor coverage. Around 80% of data traffic is handled in this band.\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Network Agency once again addressed the topic of awarding low-band frequencies in the 800 MHz spectrum, which are due to expire in 2025. In a so-called consultation paper, it advocated a prolongation of the frequencies to the three incumbent network operators. In the past, spectrum was awarded exclusively via non-discriminatory auctions in Germany, and such a prolongation would be a novelty. In the event of such an award, 1&1 would not receive access to the low-band frequencies.\n\nThe German Federal Cartel Office also commented on the spectrum award situation in November 2023. In a position paper, the Federal Cartel Office stated that an extension of the frequencies without taking 1&1 into account would expose 1&1, as a market newcomer, to serious competitive disadvantages compared to the established mobile network operators. In its position paper, the Federal Cartel Office also points out, with reference to other European countries, that the available spectrum is sufficient for four mobile network operators.\n\nVarious studies published by 1&1 on the spectrum situation in Germany came to the same conclusion. They argue that the low-band frequencies are not always being used efficiently by the three other mobile network operators and that there is no discernible correlation between a high level of spectrum held by individual mobile network operators and the performance of their mobile networks, meaning that low-band frequencies could be allocated to all four mobile network operators without any loss of quality.\n\nIn an expert opinion commissioned by 1&1, the former Federal Constitutional Court judge and renowned legal expert, Prof. Udo Di Fabio, also clearly stated that the auctioning of the first 5G spectrum to a market newcomer in 2019 resulted in additional regulatory responsibility. Prolonging the spectrum usage rights of established network operators without taking 1&1 into account as a newcomer would violate the protection of legitimate expectations principle and the equality principle and would even be unconstitutional from several points of view.\n\nThe Federal Network Agency is expected to provide further information on the exact award modalities in 2024.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Significant events**\n\n## **IPO of IONOS**\n\nOn January 17, 2023, IONOS Group SE announced concrete plans for the IPO of IONOS as part of an \"intention to float\" (ITF) and completed its IPO on February 8, 2023. The shares of IONOS Group SE have since been listed on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) under ISIN: DE000A3E00M1, WKN: A3E00M, ticker symbol: IOS. United Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292 million from the sale of shares, while the entire placement volume amounted to around € 389 million. Following the IPO of IONOS Group SE, United Internet holds 63.8% and Warburg Pincus 21.2% of IONOS shares. 15.0% of shares are in free float.\n\n## **Acquisition of fiber-optic city networks from BT**\n\nIn early July 2023, 1&1 Versatel acquired four fiber-optic city networks from BT. The acquisition of the BT city networks in Munich, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Stuttgart with a total length of 1,590 km is in line with 1&1 Versatel's strategy of steadily expanding its own fiber-optic network. The purchase price amounted to around € 42 million.\n\n## **Conclusion of binding heads of terms for a long-term exclusive national roaming partnership with Vodafone**\n\nIn August 2023, 1&1 concluded binding heads of terms with Vodafone for a long-term exclusive national roaming partnership.\n\nThe national roaming cooperation includes the non- discriminatory provision of national roaming services in areas not yet covered by the new 1&1 mobile network and comprises in particular access to Vodafone's 5G network including the mobile standards 2G and 4G, as well as future mobile standards and technologies.\n\nThe starting date for the Vodafone national roaming services will be one year after concluding the final national roaming cooperation, however no later than October 1, 2024. The basic term of the national roaming cooperation will be 5 years from that point on. 1&1 Mobilfunk will have the right to prolong the term of the national roaming cooperation up to twice by five further years each time – i.e., by up to an additional 10 years. The end of the contract term will be followed by a transition period of three years.\n\nThe calculation basis is a so-called capacity model, under which 1&1 will pay a fixed price per percentage point for the percentage share of the Vodafone network used by its customers. This fixed price changes from time to time in line with the percentage cost development of the Vodafone network. The conditions are thus geared to future market developments and enable 1&1 to make competitive offers over the long term.\n\n## **Addition of 5G to national roaming agreement with Telefónica**\n\nIn November 2023, 1&1 expanded the national roaming agreement it concluded with Telefónica Germany in May 2021 with the addition of 5G.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nWherever the 5G network currently under construction does not yet have its own coverage, 1&1 customers will automatically have access to Telefónica Germany's 2G/4G/5G network as part of the national roaming agreement expanded to include 5G. From October 2024 at the latest, 1&1 will use national roaming from Vodafone as planned and gradually reduce its advance services from Telefónica Germany.\n\n## **1&1 O-RAN: launch of mobile services in Europe's most modern 5G network**\n\nFollowing the launch of \"1&1 5G at home\" in December 2022, 1&1 activated its mobile services on December 8, 2023. Germany's fourth mobile network is thus now fully functional and can also be used with smartphones on the move.\n\nA condition for the activation of mobile services was the previously completed provision of 5G national roaming by Telefónica Germany. This means that 1&1 customers can now access Telefónica's 5G network wherever the 1&1 network, which is currently being set up, does not yet have its own coverage – automatically and without interruption. Vodafone is scheduled to provide 5G national roaming from summer 2024.\n\n1&1 is the first network operator in Europe to rely entirely on the new Open RAN technology. At the heart of the 1&1 network (\"1&1 O-RAN\") is a private cloud operated in hundreds of cities through decentralized edge data centers. All network functions are controlled by software running on conventional servers. 1&1 plans to use Gigabit antennas at all antenna locations, which are connected via fiber-optic cable to the 1&1 edge data centers. This network architecture enables minimal latency, which is essential for future real-time applications.\n\nUnlike traditional networks based on proprietary technology from specialized network suppliers, such as Huawei, the 1&1 O-RAN has a large number of standardized interfaces. This means that software and hardware components from the most innovative and secure providers can be flexibly combined. At the same time, it also eliminates 1&1's dependence on individual suppliers.\n\n## **Partial repayment of the shareholder loan by IONOS Group SE**\n\nIn December 2023, IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity. Following the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million and is subordinated. The shareholder loan continues to have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.75%, a term until December 15, 2026, and is to be gradually repaid before this date.\n\nThere were no other significant events in fiscal 2023 which had a material effect on the development of business.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.2 Business development\n\n# Segment reporting changed from \"controlling view\" to \"accounting view\"\n\nIn the course of preparing the Interim Financial Statements as at March 31, 2023, the Management Board decided to make a significant adjustment to its internal reporting system. As a consequence, this change also led to a revision of segment reporting with a shift in focus from the previous \"controlling view\" to the \"accounting view\". This decision was intended to strengthen the harmonization of the Company's internal controlling and external reporting. The change resulted in reconciliation effects/shifts in key sales and earnings figures among the segments.\n\n- Reconciliation effects on sales: certain intercompany sales are no longer consolidated at segment level (as previously in the controlling view), but only at Group level (accounting view).\n- Reconciliation effects on EBITDA and EBIT: depreciation allocations and profit margins for intercompany services are no longer \"netted\" between segments (as was previously the case for internal service charging in the controlling view) but are disclosed (accounting view) – as if \"booked\" at segment level.\n\nOverall, the change has no effect on the Group's sales and earnings figures, as reporting at Group level was already based on the \"accounting view\".\n\nBy making this change at segment level, United Internet is also taking account of the increasing independence of its segments (subgroups) and aligning segment reporting with the reporting of its listed and thus also reportable subgroups 1&1 AG (Consumer Access segment) and IONOS Group SE (Business Applications segment).\n\nA reconciliation of sales, as well as operating EBITDA and EBIT, for the preceding quarters Q1 2022 - Q4 2022 and the fiscal years 2019 - 2022 is presented in the Notes on the Interim Statement Q1 2023 (page 28 et seq.).\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Use and definition of relevant financial performance measures\n\nIn order to ensure the clear and transparent presentation of United Internet's business trend, the Group's Annual Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements include key financial performance measures - in addition to the disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) – such as EBITDA, the EBITDA margin, EBIT, the EBIT margin, and free cash flow.\n\nUnited Internet defines these measures as follows:\n\n- **EBIT:** Earnings before interest and taxes represents the operating result disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.\n- **EBIT margin:** Presents the ratio of EBIT to sales.\n- **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are calculated as EBIT/operating result plus the depreciation and amortization (disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements) of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as well as assets capitalized in the course of company acquisitions.\n- **EBITDA margin:** Presents the ratio of EBITDA to sales.\n- **Free cash flow:** Calculated as cash flow from operating activities (disclosed in the consolidated financial statement), less capital expenditure for intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, plus payments from the disposal of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\n\nInsofar as necessary for a clear and transparent presentation, these indicators are adjusted for special items and disclosed as \"key operating figures\" (e.g., operating EBITDA, operating EBIT, and operating EPS). A reconciliation of EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS (according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income) with figures adjusted for special items can be found in chapter 2.3 \"Position of the Group\".\n\nSuch special items usually refer solely to those effects capable of restricting the validity of the key financial performance measures with regard to the Group's financial and earnings performance – due to their nature, frequency, and/or magnitude. All special items are presented and explained for the purpose of reconciliation from the unadjusted key financial figures to the key operating figures in the relevant section of the financial statements.\n\nBy contrast, expenses for the 1&1 network rollout or start-up costs for new business fields of 1&1 Versatel are not adjusted but disclosed – should there be any – in the respective sections.\n\nCurrency-adjusted sales and earnings figures are calculated by converting sales and earnings figures with the average exchange rates of the comparative period, instead of the current period.\n\nThe most important key financial figures for managing the Group are sales and operating EBITDA according to IFRS.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Actual and forecast development 2023\n\nUnited Internet AG maintained its growth trajectory in the fiscal year 2023 and reached its guidance for the fiscal year 2023, as issued in March 2023 and updated in November 2023.\n\n## **Forecast development**\n\nIn an ad-hoc announcement on March 29, 2023, United Internet published its guidance for the fiscal year 2023 and updated it during the year as follows:\n\n|        | Forecast 2023<br>(March 2023)                              | Specification<br>(November 2023)                 |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Sales  | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion)           | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion) |\n| EBITDA | at the previous year's level(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion) | slight increase(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion)    |\n\n(1) This includes around € -120 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network\n\n## **Actual development**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, consolidated sales rose by 5.0%, from € 5.915 billion in the previous year to € 6.213 billion and were thus slightly above the sales forecast (March 2023: approx. € 6.2 billion).\n\nWithout consideration of non-cash valuation effects from derivatives (€ -0.5 million in the previous year; € -6.3 million in 2023) and additionally adjusted for IPO costs in connection with the IPO of Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE (€ -8.8 million in the previous year; € -1.7 million in 2023), operating EBITDA for the Group in the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 1.300 billion and was thus 2.2% above the comparable prior-year figure (€ 1.272 billion). As a result, EBITDA was above the original EBITDA forecast (\"on a par with the previous year\") and within the range of the EBITDA update (\"slight increase\") – despite higher expenses (€ -132.4 million) for the rollout of 1&1's mobile network than originally anticipated (approx. € -120 million).\n\n#### **Summary: actual and forecast development of business in 2023**\n\n|        | Forecast 2023<br>(March 2023)                              | Specification<br>(November 2023)                 | Actual<br>2023     |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Sales  | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion)           | approx. € 6.2 billion<br>(2022: € 5.915 billion) | € 6.213 billion    |\n| EBITDA | at the previous year's level(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion) | slight increase(1)<br>(2022: € 1.272 billion)    | € 1.300 billion(2) |\n\n(1) This includes around € -120 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network (2) This includes € -132.4 million (2022: € -52.4 million) for the expansion of the 1&1 mobile network\n\nNet income of United Internet AG (parent company) for the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 274.0 million (including a special item of € 219.1 million from income from the disposal of financial assets as a result of the sale of shares in Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE as part of the IONOS IPO). Without this special item, the parent company's net income for the year was \"in the mid-double-digit million range\" as forecast.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Development of divisions and segments\n\nThe Group's operating activities are divided into the business divisions Access and Applications, which in turn are divided into the segments Consumer Access and Business Access, as well as Consumer Applications and Business Applications.\n\nDetails on the business models of the individual segments are presented in chapter 1.1 \"Business model\".\n\n## **Consumer Access segment**\n\nIn addition to preparations for the launch of mobile services in the 1&1 mobile network, the Consumer Access segment once again focused on adding further valuable broadband and mobile internet contracts in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe total number of fee-based contracts in the Consumer Access segment rose by 480,000 contracts to 16.26 million in 2023. As expected, the number of broadband connections decreased by -90,000 to 4.01 million, but stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the reporting period, mobile internet contracts increased by 570,000 to 12.25 million.\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Access contracts in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n| in million                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Consumer Access, total contracts | 16.26         | 15.78         | + 0.48 |\n| thereof Mobile Internet          | 12.25         | 11.68         | + 0.57 |\n| thereof broadband connections    | 4.01          | 4.10          | - 0.09 |\n\n#### **Development of Consumer Access contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023**\n\n| in million                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2023 | Change |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|\n| Consumer Access, total contracts | 16.26         | 16.11          | + 0.15 |\n| thereof Mobile Internet          | 12.25         | 12.10          | + 0.15 |\n| thereof broadband connections    | 4.01          | 4.01           | 0.00   |\n\nSales of the Consumer Access segment rose by 3.4% in the fiscal year 2023, from € 3,963.7 million in the previous year to € 4,096.7 million.\n\nDue to good contract growth on the whole, high-margin service revenues – which represent the core business of the segment – rose by 2.1% from € 3,175.4 million in the previous year to € 3,243.2 million in 2023. Low-margin hardware sales rose by 8.3%, or € 65.2 million, from € 788.3 million to € 853.5 million. Hardware sales are subject to seasonal effects and also depend strongly on the appeal of new devices and the model cycles of hardware manufacturers. Consequently, this effect may be reversed in the coming quarters. If this is the case, however, it would have no significant impact on the segment's EBITDA trend.\n\nMainly as a result of the planned increase in costs for the rollout of 1&1's mobile communications network, segment EBITDA of € 653.8 million was 5.7% or € 39.5 million down on the previous year (€ 693.3 million). The expenses for network rollout included in this calculation amounted to € -132.4 million, compared to € -52.4 million in the previous year – corresponding to a year-on-year increase of € -80.0 million.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, segment EBIT was impacted by increased depreciation due to investments in the rollout of the 1&1 mobile network (€ -46.2 million). On the whole, segment EBIT of € 455.8 million was 14.8%, or € 79.1 million, below the prior-year figure (€ 534.9 million). Since the beginning of 2024, the increase in depreciation on investments – mainly due to the operational launch of 1&1's mobile network – is being offset by steadily increasing cost savings on advance services.\n\nThere was a corresponding decline in the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin from 17.5% in the previous year to 16.0% and from 13.5% in the previous year to 11.1%, respectively.\n\nThe number of employees increased by 5.0% in 2023 to 3,320 (prior year: 3,163).\n\n#### **Key sales and earnings figures in the Consumer Access segment (in € million)**\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/4 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing sales, service sales, other sales, EBITDA, and EBIT for 2023 and 2022. Sales were 4,096.7 in 2023 and 3,963.7 in 2022, a +3.4% change. Service sales were 3,243.2 in 2023 and 3,175.4 in 2022, a +2.1% change. Other sales were 853.5 in 2023 and 788.3 in 2022, a +8.3% change. EBITDA was 653.8 in 2023 and 693.3 in 2022, a -5.7% change.

Among other things, the network was connected with all national and international networks and the functionality of mobile services was checked with external customer groups.\n\nIn August 2023, 1&1 also agreed a long-term national roaming partnership with Vodafone. On the basis of this agreement, the national roaming services currently provided by Telefónica are to be gradually replaced from summer 2024. National roaming is required to provide coverage for over twelve million 1&1 mobile customers during the construction phase of the network in those areas where 1&1 does not yet have its own network coverage.\n\nThe 1&1 network is based on innovative OpenRAN technology. Hardware, software and services from a variety of partner companies are used in the 1&1 O-RAN. This makes 1&1 independent of dominant manufacturers such as Huawei. And unlike conventional networks, the 1&1 network is operated in a private cloud that is spread across hundreds of far edge data centers throughout Germany. 112 regional far edge data centers are already in operation, as are 23 decentralized edge data centers and two core data centers. All network functions are controlled by software running on market-standard servers. Gigabit antennas are used at all locations and connected to the regional far edge data centers via fiberoptic cable. This architecture enables minimal latency, which is essential for future real-time applications.\n\n1&1 is also making good progress with the construction of its antenna locations: the initial backlog caused by delivery shortfalls of its main supplier is now being gradually made up in cooperation with additionally commissioned expansion partners. At the end of 2023, 1&1 had 1,062 antenna locations (passive architecture). By the end of 2024, this figure is set to rise to approx. 3,000 locations for the installation of 5G high-performance antennas and connection to fiber-optic cable.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Business Access segment**\n\nSales in the Business Access segment rose by 3.8% from € 534.4 million in the previous year to € 564.0 million in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nDespite start-up costs for new business fields, segment EBITDA improved by 5.7% from € 154.1 million in the previous year to € 162.9 million in 2023. As a result, the EBITDA margin rose from 28.4% to 28.9%.\n\nIn the new \"5G\" business field, 1&1 Versatel is responsible for setting up data centers and fiber-optic connections for the antenna locations of 1&1's mobile network and providing them to 1&1 on a rental basis as part of an intercompany agreement. In its second new business field \"Expansion of business parks\", 1&1 Versatel uses newly constructed regional expansion clusters to provide fiber-optic connections for companies in business parks. In the fiscal year 2023, total start-up costs for the new business fields amounted to € -21.5 million (prior year: € -10.8 million) for EBITDA and € -65.2 million (prior year: € -20.6 million) for EBIT.\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned start-up costs for new business fields, as well as increased depreciation for the associated investments in network infrastructure, segment EBIT decreased from € -39.5 million in the previous year to € -51.5 million. Without consideration of the new business fields, segment EBIT improved from € -18.9 million in the previous year to € 13.7 million in 2023.\n\nThe number of employees increased by 13.9% in 2023 to 1,522 (prior year: 1,336).\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/6 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing sales, EBITDA, and EBIT for 2023 and 2022. Sales were 564.0 in 2023 and 543.4 in 2022, representing a +3.8% change. EBITDA was 162.9 in 2023 and 154.1 in 2022, representing a +5.7% change.

Accordingly, only voting rights notifications that have reached at least the first notification threshold of 3% are taken into account. In addition, any directors' dealings announcements available to the Company have been taken into account accordingly.\n\nThe treasury shares held by United Internet do not carry voting or dividend rights. Due to the nonvoting nature of treasury shares, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by companies controlled by Mr. Dommermuth in relation to the total number of voting rights of United Internet AG amounts to 54.37%, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by Bank of America to 5.48%, the proportion of shares with voting rights held by Wellington to 3.35%, and the proportion of shares with voting rights in free float to 36.80%.\n\n## **Dividend**\n\nUnited Internet's dividend policy aims to pay a dividend to shareholders of approx. 20-40% of adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests (adjusted consolidated net income attributable to the \"shareholders of United Internet AG\" – according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income), provided that funds are not needed for further Company development.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG held on May 17, 2023, the proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board to pay a dividend of € 0.50 per share (prior year: € 0.50) for the fiscal year 2022, was approved with a majority of 99.93% of votes cast. As a consequence, a total of € 86.4 million (prior year: € 93.4 million) was distributed on May 23, 2023. The payout ratio was thus 23.5% of the adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests for 2022 (€ 374.1 million) and – in view of the investments already made and still due to be made in the Company's own mobile communications network and in the expansion of its own fiber-optic network – therefore within the range targeted by the dividend policy.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG will propose to the Supervisory Board a dividend of € 0.50 per share (prior year: € 0.50). The Management Board and Supervisory Board will discuss this dividend proposal at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 20, 2024 (and thus after the preparation deadline for this Management Report). The Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG on May 17, 2024 will then vote on whether to adopt the joint proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nOn the basis of around 172.8 million shares with dividend entitlement (as of December 31, 2023), the total dividend payment for fiscal year 2023 would amount to € 86.4 million. The dividend payout ratio would therefore be 35.6% of adjusted consolidated net income after minority interests for 2023 (€ 243.0 million) and thus lie – despite the investments already made and still due to be made in the Company's own mobile communications network and in the expansion of its own fiber-optic network – within the upper range of the dividend policy. Based on the closing price of the United Internet share on December 31, 2023, the dividend yield would be 2.2%.\n\n|                                 | For 2019 | For 2020 | For 2021 | For 2022 | For 2023(1) |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Dividend per share (in €)       | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50        |\n| Dividend payment (in € million) | 93.9     | 93.6     | 93.4     | 86.4     | 86.4        |\n| Payout ratio                    | 22.2%    | 32.2%    | 22.4%    | 23.5%    | 37.1%       |\n| Adjusted payout ratio(2)        | 23.6%    | 26.7%    | 23.7%    | 23.1%    | 35.6%       |\n| Dividend yield(3)               | 1.7%     | 1.5%     | 1.4%     | 2.6%     | 2.2%        |\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: dividend development**\n\n(1) Subject to approval of Supervisory Board and Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2024\n\n(2) Without special items\n\n(3) As of: December 31\n\n## **Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2023**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG was held in Frankfurt am Main on May 17, 2023.\n\nOf the Company's registered capital stock of € 192,000,000.00, divided into192,000,000 no-par value shares, of which 19,183,705 treasury shares without voting rights, a total of 135,921,273 no-par value shares with the same number of voting rights were represented. Including the postal votes received for 956,726 no-par value shares, this corresponded to a total of 136,877,999 no-par value shares or 71.29% of the registered capital stock, or 79.20% of the registered capital stock less treasury shares.\n\nThe shareholders adopted all resolutions on the agenda requiring voting with large majorities.\n\n## **Capital stock and treasury shares**\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2022, United Internet AG held 7,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 3.75% of the capital stock at the time of 194,000,000 shares.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and on the basis of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 regarding the acquisition and use of treasury shares, to initially cancel two million treasury shares and to reduce the capital stock of United Internet AG by € 2 million from € 194 million to € 192 million. The number of shares issued decreased accordingly by two million shares, from 194 million shares to 192 million shares. The pro-rata amount of capital stock per issued share remained unchanged at € 1 per share. The cancellation of the treasury shares serves to increase the proportionate participation of United Internet shareholders. Following the cancellation of the aforementioned two\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion shares, United Internet AG initially held 5,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 2.75% of the Company's current capital stock.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG also decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9 million shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9 million. With the public share buyback offer, United Internet AG made use of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company on May 20, 2020, under which up to 10% of the Company's capital stock could be bought back by August 31, 2023. The shares bought back may be used for all of the purposes permitted under the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020. The shares may also be canceled.\n\nIn the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period. The offer was based on the buyback of up to 13.9 million shares in total. As the total number of shares for which the offer was accepted exceeded this maximum amount, the declarations of acceptance were considered on a pro rata basis, i.e., corresponding to the ratio of the maximum number of United Internet shares to be purchased pursuant to this offer, i.e., 13.9 million United Internet shares, to the aggregate number of United Internet shares tendered by United Internet shareholders for buyback.\n\nUpon completion of the above mentioned capital reduction by cancellation of 2 million treasury shares and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet holds 19,183,705 treasury shares as of December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares. In view of the offer price of € 21.00 per United Internet share, the purchase price for the buyback of 13,899,596 shares in total amounted to € 291.9 million. For further details, please refer to note 39 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Investor Relations**\n\nContinuous and transparent corporate communication with all capital market participants is important for United Internet. The Company aims to provide all target groups with timely information without discrimination. To this end, the Management Board and the Investor Relations department continued their regular discussions with institutional and private investors in the fiscal year 2023. The capital market was informed via the quarterly statements, half-year financial report and annual report, press and analyst conferences, as well as via various webcasts. The Company's management and Investor Relations department explained the Company's strategy and financial results in numerous one-on-one discussions at the Company's offices in Montabaur, as well as at roadshows and conferences in Europe and North America. In addition, over 15 national and international investment banks are in contact with the Company's Investor Relations department and regularly publish studies and comments on the Company's progress and share performance.\n\nApart from one-on-one meetings, shareholders and potential future investors can also receive the latest news around the clock via the Company's extensive and bilingual website (www.unitedinternet.de). In addition to the publication dates of financial reports, the dates and venues of investor conferences and roadshows are made publicly available at https://www.united-internet.de/investorrelations/finanzkalender.html. Online versions of the Annual Report and Sustainability Report are also provided on the corporate website.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Personnel report\n\nAs a telecommunications and internet company, United Internet is subject to the defining characteristics of the industry: rapid change, short innovation cycles, and fierce competition. United Internet AG has risen to these challenges with great success over many years now. One of the key factors for the success and growth of the United Internet Group are its dedicated and highly competent employees and executives with their entrepreneurial and autonomous approach to work. The Company therefore attaches great importance to a sustainable and balanced strategy across all aspects of its HR activities: from employee recruitment, to targeted entry-level and vocational training formats, tailored skills training programs, support with individual career paths, through to sustainable management development programs, and the long-term retention of executives, high potentials, and top performers.\n\nUnited Internet AG was once again recognized as a top employer in 2023. Based on an independent study of the \"Top Employers Institute\", United Internet received the \"TOP Employers Germany\" award – as in the preceding years. Certification is only awarded to organizations which offer staff attractive working conditions. Assessment is based on career opportunities, employer benefits, and working conditions, as well as training and development opportunities.\n\n## **Headcount and personnel expenses**\n\nIn the highly competitive market for skilled workers in the ICT sector, United Internet once again succeeded in recruiting top staff for its key positions and thus meeting the needs of its growing business. In addition to targeted employer branding, partnerships with education and training providers, and the positive impact of the Company's product brands, our successful recruitment efforts center around a candidate-friendly, highly competitive acquisition and selection process.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the number of employees increased year on year by 4.7%, or 488 employees, to 10,962 (prior year: 10,474). This increase was in line with the development of business and resulted mainly from the Consumer Access and Business Access segments due to the strong increase in headcount for the rollout of 1&1's mobile network and the expansion of 1&1 Versatel's fiber-optic network.\n\nHeadcount in Germany rose by 5.0% or 431 employees, to 8,981 as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: 8,550). The number of employees at the Group's non-German subsidiaries grew by 3.0%, or 57 employees, to 1,981 (prior year: 1,924).\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: headcount development by location(1); year-on-year change**\n\n|                    | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022   | 2023   | Change |\n|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees, total   | 9,374 | 9,638 | 9,975 | 10,474 | 10,962 | + 4.7% |\n| thereof in Germany | 7,761 | 7,929 | 8,199 | 8,550  | 8,981  | + 5.0% |\n| thereof abroad     | 1,613 | 1,709 | 1,776 | 1,924  | 1,981  | + 3.0% |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nFrom the segment perspective, there were 3,320 employees in the Consumer Access segment (prior year: 3,163), 1,522 in the Business Access segment (prior year: 1,336), 1,072 in the Consumer Applications segment (prior year: 1,036), and 4,364 in the Business Applications segment (prior year: 4,247).

As a result, the personnel expense ratio increased to 12.2%.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of personnel expenses; year-on-year change**\n\n|                         |  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | Change  |\n|-------------------------|--|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| in € million            |  |       |       |       |       |       |         |\n| Personnel expenses      |  | 552.8 | 592.3 | 645.4 | 675.5 | 760.0 | + 12.5% |\n| Personnel expense ratio |  | 10.6% | 11.0% | 11.4% | 11.4% | 12.2% |         |\n\nSales per employee, based on annual average headcount, amounted to approx. € 580k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: approx. € 579k).\n\n## **Diversity**\n\nRespect for diversity is a core aspect of United Internet's corporate culture. The reason for this is simple: only a workforce that mirrors the many different facets of society offers the best possible conditions for creativity and productivity, and makes employees – and the organization itself – unique. This unique diversity creates an incomparable wealth of potential ideas and innovations, increasing the Company's competitiveness and providing opportunities for all.\n\nAll United Internet employees are to be treated with respect and should receive the same opportunities, regardless of their nationality, ethnic origin, religion, ideological beliefs, gender and gender identity, age, disability, or sexual orientation and identity. Each employee should be able to find the area of activity and function in which they can make the most of their individual potential and talents.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employees by gender(1)**\n\n|       | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Women | 32%  | 32%  | 33%  | 32%  | 33%  |\n| Men   | 68%  | 68%  | 67%  | 68%  | 67%  |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nThe average age of the United Internet Group's employees at the end of fiscal year 2023 was around 40 (prior year: 39).\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employee age profile(1)**\n\n|         | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| < 30    | 23%  | 23%  | 22%  | 23%  | 20%  |\n| 30 – 39 | 34%  | 33%  | 33%  | 31%  | 32%  |\n| 40 – 49 | 27%  | 27%  | 27%  | 27%  | 28%  |\n| ≥ 50    | 16%  | 17%  | 18%  | 19%  | 20%  |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nEmployees of United Internet AG work in an international environment at around 40 sites around the world.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: employees by country(1)**\n\n|                     | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Employees, total    | 9,374 | 9,638 | 9,975 | 10,474 | 10,962 |\n| thereof Germany     | 7,761 | 7,929 | 8,199 | 8,550  | 8,981  |\n| thereof France      | 3     | 3     | 4     | 7      | 8      |\n| thereof UK          | 233   | 251   | 251   | 246    | 273    |\n| thereof Austria     | 43    | 44    | 65    | 67     | 72     |\n| thereof Philippines | 360   | 395   | 392   | 468    | 464    |\n| thereof Poland      | 309   | 299   | 333   | 352    | 339    |\n| thereof Romania     | 195   | 217   | 229   | 242    | 261    |\n| thereof Spain       | 330   | 340   | 381   | 422    | 445    |\n| thereof USA         | 140   | 160   | 121   | 120    | 119    |\n\n(1) Active employees as December 31 of the respective fiscal year\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"Working Conditions and HR Strategy\", \"Training and Education\", \"Recruiting and Retaining Young Talent\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", and \"Occupational Health and Safety, and Health Management\", please refer to the chapter \"Social Responsibility\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html).\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Liquidity and finance\n\nThe Group's financial strategy is primarily geared to the strategic business plans of its operating business units. In order to provide sufficient flexibility for further growth, United Internet therefore constantly monitors trends in funding opportunities arising on the financial markets. Various options for funding and potential for optimizing existing financial instruments are regularly reviewed. The main focus is on ensuring sufficient liquidity and the financial independence of the Group at all times. In addition to its own financial strength, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity reserves with core banks. The flexible use of these liquidity reserves enables efficient management of Group liquidity, as well as optimal debt management to reduce interest costs.\n\nA euro cash pooling agreement (zero balancing) has been in place between United Internet AG and certain subsidiaries since July 2012. Under the agreement, credit and debit balances of the participating Group subsidiaries are pooled and netted via several cascades in a central bank account of United Internet AG and available each banking day.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, the Group's bank liabilities amounted to € 2,464.3 million (prior year: € 2,155.5 million) and mainly comprise promissory note loans, syndicated loans, and bilateral credit agreements / credit facilities.\n\n## **Promissory note loans**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, United Internet AG successfully placed a promissory note loan (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") – as in the years 2017 and 2021 – with an amount of € 300 million. The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. There are no covenants attached to the new promissory note loan.\n\nMoreover, two promissory note loan tranches totaling € 238.0 million were redeemed on schedule in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, total liabilities from the promissory note loans 2017, 2021, and 2023 with maximum terms until May 2030 therefore amounted to € 1,162.0 million (prior year: € 1,100.0 million).\n\n## **Partial repayment of the shareholder loan by IONOS Group SE**\n\nIn December 2023, IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity.\n\nFollowing the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million and is subordinated. The shareholder loan continues to have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.75%, a term until December 15, 2026, and is to be gradually repaid before this date.\n\n## **Syndicated loan facilities & syndicated loans**\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a banking syndicate granted United Internet AG a revolving syndicated loan facility totaling € 810 million until January 2025. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made use of a \n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontractually agreed prolongation option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated loan facility for the period from January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690 million was agreed for this prolongation period.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, € 150 million of the revolving syndicated loan facility had been drawn (prior year: € 550 million). As a result, funds of € 660 million (prior year: € 260 million) were still available to be drawn from the credit facility as at the balance sheet date.\n\n## **Bilateral credit agreements / bilateral credit facilities**\n\nThe Company also has bilateral credit agreements with several banks totaling € 50 million (prior year: € 200 million). The term expires at the latest on August 12, 2024. As of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, these bilateral credit agreements were used in full (as in the previous year).\n\nIn addition, various bilateral credit facilities amounting to € 475 million (prior year: € 400 million) are available to the Company. These have been granted in part until further notice and in part have terms until March 31, 2025. Drawings of € 295 million (prior year: € 300 million) had been made from these credit facilities as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nUnited Internet therefore had free credit lines from syndicated loan facilities and bilateral credit agreements totaling € 840 million (prior year: € 360 million) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned credit lines, the Group has guaranty credit facilities of € 105.0 million (prior year: € 105.0 million) as at the end of the reporting period, which in some cases can also be used by other Group companies. The guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees.\n\nFurther disclosures on the various financial instruments, drawings, interest rates, and maturities are provided under note 31 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there are purchase obligations for property, plant and equipment (especially for network infrastructure) totaling € 591.4 million (prior year: € 370.8 million). In addition, there are purchase commitments for intangible assets (especially software) totaling € 68.0 million (prior year: € 143.9 million).\n\nFor further details on significant investment obligations, please refer to notes 26 and 27 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.3 Position of the Group\n\nThere were no significant acquisition or divestment effects on consolidated and segment sales and EBITDA in the fiscal year 2023. There were also only minor negative currency effects at Group and segment level (mainly Business Applications segment) amounting to € 9.6 million for sales and € 2.5 million for EBITDA. The same applies to the Group's asset position, for which there were no significant effects from currency fluctuations.\n\n# Group's earnings position\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the total number of fee-based customer contracts in the United Internet Group was raised by a total of 1.03 million contracts, from 27.46 million to 28.49 million contracts.\n\nConsolidated sales increased by 5.0% in the fiscal year 2023, from € 5,915.1 million in the previous year to € 6,213.2 million. Sales outside Germany improved by 5.0% from € 625.5 million to € 656.9 million (despite negative currency effects of € 9.6 million).\n\nThe cost of sales increased from € 3,906.3 million to € 4,145.1 million in the reporting period. Consequently, the cost of sales ratio rose from 66.0% (of sales) in the previous year to 66.7% (of sales) in 2023. This was due in part to a strong year-on-year increase in low-margin hardware sales in the Consumer Access segment. As a result, the gross margin fell from 34.0% to 33.3% and consequently the growth in gross profit of 3.0% from € 2,008.7 million to € 2,068.1 million fell short of sales growth (5.0%).\n\nThe rise in sales and marketing expenses was slightly below that of sales, from € 907.2 million (15.3% of sales) in the previous year to € 943.2 million (15.2% of sales), while the increase in administrative expenses from € 248.5 million (4.2% of sales) to € 275.9 million (4.4% of sales) was slightly in excess of sales growth.\n\nThis disproportionately strong rise in some of the above mentioned cost items results in part from increased expenditure for the rollout of 1&1's mobile communications network, higher depreciation and amortization due to investments in the expansion of the fiber-optic network and mobile network, and strong increases in personnel expenses following an expansion of headcount as well as significant salary adjustments to keep pace with high inflation.\n\n| in € million                  | 2019    | 2020    | 2021       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of sales                 | 3,427.0 | 3,769.3 | 3,684.9(1) | 3,906.3 | 4,145.1 |\n| Cost of sales ratio           | 66.0%   | 70.2%   | 65.3%      | 66.0%   | 66.7%   |\n| Gross margin                  | 34.0%   | 29.8%   | 34.7%      | 34.0%   | 33.3%   |\n| Selling expenses              | 741.8   | 767.9   | 835.7      | 907.2   | 943.2   |\n| Selling expenses ratio        | 14.3%   | 14.3%   | 14.8%      | 15.3%   | 15.2%   |\n| Administrative expenses       | 205.9   | 206.0   | 243.0      | 248.5   | 275.9   |\n| Administrative expenses ratio | 4.0%    | 3.8%    | 4.3%       | 4.2%    | 4.4%    |\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: Development of key cost items**\n\n(1) Including the non-period positive effect on earnings attributable to the second half of 2020 (EBITDA and EBIT effect: € +39.4 million)\n\nOther operating expenses decreased from € 46.5 million in the previous year to € 33.3 million in 2023 and other operating income from € 92.3 million to € 60.6 million. Due to an increase in payment defaults, impairment losses on receivables and contract assets rose from € 117.4 million in the previous year to € 122.3 million in 2023.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nKey earnings figures were influenced by two special items in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022:\n\n- The special item \"IPO costs IONOS\" results from one-off costs in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE, as well as – with an opposing effect in 2023 – the partial assumption of costs by IONOS co-owner Warburg Pincus, and had an overall negative impact on EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n- The special item \"non-cash valuation effect from derivatives\" results from quarterly revaluations of derivatives and had a negative impact on EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n\n**Reconciliation of EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS with figures adjusted for special items (operating)** \n\n|                                                                                  | Fiscal year | Fiscal year |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| in € million; EPS in €                                                           | 2023        | 2022        |\n| EBITDA                                                                           | 1,292.1     | 1,262.5     |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBITDA adjusted for special items (operating)                                    | 1,300.1     | 1,271.8     |\n| EBIT                                                                             | 754.0       | 781.4       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBIT adjusted for special items (operating)                                      | 762.0       | 790.7       |\n| EBT                                                                              | 597.6       | 711.5       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.8         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 6.3         | 0.5         |\n| EBT adjusted for special items (operating)                                       | 605.6       | 720.8       |\n| Net income                                                                       | 362.2       | 464.7       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 1.7         | 8.7         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 4.4         | 0.4         |\n| Net income adjusted for special items (operating)                                | 368.3       | 473.8       |\n| Net income \"Shareholders United Internet\"                                        | 232.7       | 367.2       |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 5.9         | 6.5         |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 4.4         | 0.4         |\n| Net income \"Shareholders United Internet\" adjusted for special items (operating) | 243.0       | 374.1       |\n| EPS                                                                              | 1.35        | 1.97        |\n| IPO costs IONOS                                                                  | 0.03        | 0.03        |\n| Non-cash valuation effect from derivatives                                       | 0.03        | 0.00        |\n| EPS adjusted for special items (operating)                                       | 1.41        | 2.00        |\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdjusted for the above mentioned special items, the key performance measures EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, net income, and EPS for the fiscal year 2023 developed as follows:\n\nConsolidated operating EBITDA rose by € 28.2 million (2.2%), from € 1,271.8 million in the previous year to € 1,300.1 million. This at first glance only moderate EBITDA growth was due in particular to planned increased costs for the construction of 1&1's mobile communications network. In 2023, these rose to € -132.4 million, after € -52.4 million in the previous year.\n\nConsolidated operating EBIT was additionally burdened by increased depreciation, especially for investments in the fiber-optic network and the mobile network (€ -71.3 million). As a result, it fell by € -28.7 million (-3.6%) from € 790.7 million to € 762.0 million. Since the beginning of 2024, the increase in depreciation on investments – mainly due to the operational launch of 1&1's mobile network – is being offset by steadily increasing cost savings on advance mobile services.\n\nThere was a corresponding fall in the operating EBITDA margin and the operating EBIT margin from 21.5% to 20.9% and from 13.4% to 12.3%, respectively.\n\nThe number of Group employees rose by 4.7% to 10,962 in 2023 (prior year: 10,474).\n\nImage /page/49/Figure/15 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing Sales, EBITDA, and EBIT.

Likewise, operating consolidated net income and operating consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of United Internet AG fell from € 473.8 million to € 368.3 million and from € 374.1 million to € 243.0 million, respectively. In addition to the lower EBIT result (€ -28.7 million), this decline in the key operating figures was mainly due to a year-on-year decrease in the result from associated companies (€ -26.4 million) and the financial result (€ -60.0 million). The latter was impacted by the increase in interest rates.\n\nWithout consideration of the valuation effects from derivatives and the IONOS IPO costs (total EPS effect: € -0.06; prior year: € -0.03), operating EPS in the fiscal year 2023 declined from € 2.00 in the prior-year period to € 1.41. In addition to the decrease in EBIT (EPS effect: € -0.13), this was also due to a lower result from associated companies (EPS effect: € -0.16), and the lower financial result (EPS effect: € -0.30).\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group's financial position\n\nDespite the decline in net income, operative cash flow rose slightly from € 1,010.7 million(1) in the previous year to € 1,018.0 million in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nCash flow from operating activities increased to € 828.5 million (prior year: € 616.4 million(1) – incl. phasing effects of € -97.2 million from Q4 2021). The increase mainly results from the change in trade accounts payable.\n\nCash flow from investing activities in the reporting period led to a net outflow of € -798.2 million (prior year: € -701.6 million(1)). This resulted mainly from capital expenditures of € -797.9 million (prior year: € -681.4 million).\n\nUnited Internet's free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus payments from disposals of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Free cash flow in the fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 36.4 million (prior year: € -60.5 million(1) – incl. phasing effects). After deducting the cash flow item \"Redemption of lease liabilities\" – disclosed in cash flow from financing activities since the initial application of the accounting standard IFRS 16 – free cash flow (after leasing) amounted to € -85.0 million (prior year: € -173.2 million(1)).\n\nCash flow from financing activities in the fiscal year 2023 was dominated by the purchase of treasury shares (€ -291.9 million; prior year: € 0), the net assumption of loans (€ +305.2 million; prior year: € +328.6 million(1)), payments for interest (€ -91.0 million; prior year: € -30,2 million(1)), the redemption of lease liabilities (€ -121.3 million; prior year: € -112.6 million), dividend payments (€ -86.4 million; prior year: € -93.4 million), and payments received from minority shareholders (€ 305.0 million; prior year: € -15.2 million disbursement) in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE as well as from purchase price payments made by Warburg Pincus.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 27.7 million – compared to € 40.5 million on the same date last year.\n\n| in € million                             | 2023     | 2022(1)   | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|---------|\n| Operative cash flow                      | 1,018.0  | 1,010.7   | + 7.3   |\n| Cash flow from operating activities      | 828.5    | 616.4     | + 212.1 |\n| Cash flow from investing activities      | -798.2   | -701.6    | - 96.6  |\n| Free cash flow(2)                        | -85.0(3) | -173.2(4) | + 88.2  |\n| Cash flow from financing activities      | -43.6    | 14.2      | - 57.8  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents on December 31 | 27.7     | 40.5      | - 12.8  |\n\n#### **Development of key cash flow figures**\n\n(1) With regard to the changes in the presentation of the cash flow statement, reference is made to the explanations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 46\n\n(2) Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus payments from disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\n(2) 2023 including the repayment portion of lease liabilities (€121.3 million), which have been reported under cash flow from financing activities since the fiscal year 2019 (IFRS 16)\n\n(4) 2022 including the repayment portion of lease liabilities (€112.6 million), which have been reported under cash flow from financing activities since the fiscal year 2019 (IFRS 16)\n\nFor further details on guarantees, leases, and other financial obligations, please refer to chapter 2.2 \"Business development\", \"Liquidity and finance\", as well as note 45 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group's asset position\n\nThe balance sheet total increased from € 10.358 billion as of December 31, 2022 to € 11.246 billion on December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Development of current assets**\n\n| in € million               | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change  |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents  | 27.7          | 40.5          | - 12.8  |\n| Trade accounts receivable  | 508.9         | 418.8         | + 90.1  |\n| Contract assets            | 676.1         | 648.4         | + 27.7  |\n| Inventories                | 178.1         | 120.6         | + 57.5  |\n| Prepaid expenses           | 303.8         | 282.1         | + 21.7  |\n| Other financial assets     | 96.9          | 106.6         | - 9.7   |\n| Income tax claims          | 34.8          | 34.7          | + 0.0   |\n| Other non-financial assets | 13.8          | 19.7          | - 5.9   |\n| Total current assets       | 1,840.1       | 1,671.4       | + 168.7 |\n\nCurrent assets rose from € 1,671.4 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 1,840.1 million on December 31, 2023. However, cash and cash equivalents disclosed under current assets decreased from € 40.5 million to € 27.7 million due to closing-date effects. Likewise, trade accounts receivable fell from € 418.8 million to € 508.9 million due to closing-date effects. As a result of customer growth, the item current contract assets rose from € 648.4 million to € 676.1 million and includes current claims against customers due to accelerated revenue recognition from the application of IFRS 15. In order to avoid supply bottlenecks, inventories were raised from € 120.6 million to € 178.1 million. Due to prepayments made to advance service providers and closing-date effects, current prepaid expenses increased from € 282.1 million to € 303.8 million and mainly comprise the short-term portion of expenses relating to contract acquisition and contract fulfillment according to IFRS 15.

Due in particular to the deterioration in the pro rata result of investments (mainly Kublai / Tele Columbus), shares in associated companies fell from € 429.3 million to € 373.2 million. Capital expenditures in the reporting period (especially for the 5G network rollout and expansion of the fiber-optic network in the Consumer Access and Business Access segments) led to a strong increase in property, plant and equipment from € 1,851.0 million to € 2,405.3 million, while intangible assets declined from € 2,029.3 million to € 2,001.6 million mainly as a result of amortization. Due to\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nprepayments made to advance service providers and closing-date effects, non-current prepaid expenses rose strongly from € 429.0 million to € 679.8 million.

Due to closing-date effects, current trade accounts payable increased from € 561.5 million to € 699.2 million. There was a decrease in current liabilities due to banks from € 656.7 million to € 582.4 million as a result of the reduction of short-term liabilities. Current other nonfinancial liabilities increased from € 69.0 million to € 129.6 million and mainly include liabilities due to tax authorities as of the respective balance sheet date. The items income tax liabilities and current contract liabilities (which mainly include payments received from customer contracts for which the performance has not yet been completely rendered), as well as current other accrued liabilities, and current other financial liabilities were all virtually unchanged.\n\n#### **Development of non-current liabilities**\n\n| in € million                  | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change  |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n| Liabilities due to banks      | 1,881.9       | 1,498.8       | + 383.0 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities      | 293.0         | 309.7         | - 16.7  |\n| Trade accounts payable        | 3.4           | 4.3           | - 0.9   |\n| Contract liabilities          | 32.7          | 31.3          | + 1.4   |\n| Other accrued liabilities     | 68.7          | 67.1          | + 1.6   |\n| Other financial liabilities   | 1,388.3       | 1,313.3       | + 75.0  |\n| Total non-current liabilities | 3,667.9       | 3,224.5       | + 443.4 |\n\nNon-current liabilities increased from € 3,224.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 3,667.9 million on December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to non-current liabilities due to banks, which rose from € 1,498.8 million to € 1,881.9 million, largely as a result of the assumption of a promissory note loan totaling € 300 million. As a result of higher leasing additions (IFRS 16), other financial liabilities rose from € 1,313.3 million to € 1,388.3 million. The items deferred tax liabilities, non-current trade accounts payable, non-current contract liabilities, as well as non-current other accrued liabilities were largely unchanged.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in € million                                              | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Change  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n| Capital stock                                             | 192.0         | 194.0         | - 2.0   |\n| Capital reserves                                          | 2,197.7       | 1,966.2       | + 231.6 |\n| Accumulated profit                                        | 2,980.5       | 2,835.8       | + 144.7 |\n| Treasury shares                                           | -459.8        | -231.5        | - 228.3 |\n| Revaluation reserves                                      | 0.1           | 1.3           | - 1.2   |\n| Currency translation adjustment                           | -12.5         | -15.7         | + 3.2   |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent company | 4,898.0       | 4,750.1       | + 147.9 |\n| Non-controlling interests                                 | 657.0         | 548.3         | + 108.7 |\n| Total equity                                              | 5,555.1       | 5,298.4       | + 256.7 |\n\n**Development of equity** \n\nConsolidated equity capital rose from € 5,298.4 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 5,555.1 million on December 31, 2023. The Group's accumulated profit – comprising the past profits of the consolidated companies, insofar as they were not distributed – rose from € 2,835.8 million to € 2,980.5 million in the fiscal year 2023. At the same time, capital reserves rose from € 1,966.2 million to € 2,197.7 million due to the sale of shares during the IONOS IPO with an opposing effect from the cancellation of treasury shares. As a result of the share buyback explained below, there was an increase in the value of treasury shares from € -231.5 million to € -459.8 million. Treasury shares are deducted from equity capital. The consolidated equity ratio fell slightly from 51.2% to 49.4%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, United Internet AG held a total of 7,284,109 treasury shares, corresponding to approx. 3.75% of the capital stock at the time of 194,000,000 shares. On February 14, 2023, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and on the basis of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 regarding the acquisition and use of treasury shares, to initially cancel two million treasury shares and to reduce the capital stock of United Internet AG from € 194 million to € 192 million. The number of shares issued decreased accordingly from 194 million shares to 192 million shares. The pro-rata amount of capital stock per issued share remained unchanged at € 1. The cancellation of the treasury shares serves to increase the proportionate participation of United Internet shareholders. Following the cancellation of the aforementioned two million shares, United Internet AG initially held 5,284,109 treasury shares. This corresponded to approx. 2.75% of the Company's current capital stock.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG also decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9 million shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9 million. With the public share buyback offer, United Internet AG made use of the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company on May 20, 2020, under which up to 10% of the Company's capital stock could be bought back by August 31, 2023. The shares bought back may be used for all of the purposes permitted under the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020. The shares may also be canceled.\n\nIn the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period. The offer was based on the buyback of up to 13.9 million shares in total. As the total number of shares for which the offer was accepted exceeded this maximum amount, the declarations of acceptance were considered on a pro rata basis, i.e., corresponding to the ratio of the maximum number of United Internet shares to be purchased pursuant to this offer, i.e., 13.9 \n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion United Internet shares, to the aggregate number of United Internet shares tendered by United Internet shareholders for buyback.\n\nUpon completion of the above mentioned capital reduction by means of canceling two million treasury shares, and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet holds 19,183,705 treasury shares as of December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares. In view of the offer price of € 21.00 per United Internet share, the purchase price for the buyback of 13,899,596 shares in total amounted to € 291.9 million and thus corresponded approximately to the sales proceeds of United Internet from the IONOS IPO.\n\nDue mainly to investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (€ -797.9 million, of which € -41.9 million for the acquisition of the BT city networks), as well as the contingent payment for advance services to Deutsche Telekom (€ -276.5 million), and the dividend payment (€ -86.4 million), net bank liabilities (i.e., the balance of bank liabilities and cash and cash equivalents) increased from € 2,115.0 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 2,436.6 million on December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, United Internet AG successfully placed a promissory note loan totaling € 300 million. The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. Moreover, in December 2023, the subsidiary IONOS Group SE concluded a loan of € 800 million with a banking syndicate to partially refinance its existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. Following the partial repayment, the shareholder loan with United Internet amounts to € 350 million.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of relative indebtedness**\n\n|                                     | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, | Dec. 31, |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|                                     | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     | 2022     | 2023     |\n| Net bank liabilities(1) /<br>EBITDA | 1.28     | 1.27     | 1.31     | 1.68     | 1.89     |\n\n(1) Net bank liabilities = balance of bank liabilities and cash and cash equivalents\n\nFurther details on the objectives and methods of the Group's financial risk management are provided under note 43 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### **Multi-period overview: development of key balance sheet items**\n\n| in € million                   | Dec. 31,<br>2019 | Dec. 31,<br>2020 | Dec. 31,<br>2021 | Dec. 31,<br>2022 | Dec. 31,<br>2023 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Total assets                   | 9,128.8          | 9,230.8          | 9,669.1          | 10,358.5         | 11,245.6         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents      | 117.6            | 131.3            | 110.1            | 40.5             | 27.7             |\n| Shares in associated companies | 196.0            | 89.6(1)          | 431.6(1)         | 429.3            | 373.2            |\n| Other financial assets         | 90.4             | 9.9(2)           | 11.6             | 10.7             | 8.3              |\n| Property, plant and equipment  | 1,160.6          | 1,271.6          | 1,379.6          | 1,851.0          | 2,405.3          |\n| Intangible assets              | 2,167.4          | 2,197.8          | 2,059.4          | 2,029.3          | 2,001.6          |\n| Goodwill                       | 3,616.5          | 3,609.4          | 3,627.8          | 3,623.4          | 3,628.8          |\n| Liabilities due to banks       | 1,738.4          | 1,466.1          | 1,822.7          | 2,155.5          | 2,464.3          |\n| Capital stock                  | 205.0            | 194.0(3)         | 194.0            | 194.0            | 192.0(3)         |\n| Equity                         | 4,614.7          | 4,911.2          | 4,923.2          | 5,298.4          | 5,555.1          |\n| Equity ratio                   | 50.6%            | 53.2%            | 50.9%            | 51.2%            | 49.4%            |\n\n(1) Decrease due to reclassification Tele Columbus (2020); increase due to stake in Kublai (2021)\n\n(2) Decrease due to sale of Afilias shares (2020)\n\n(3) Decrease due to withdrawal of treasury shares (2020 and 2023)\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's business situation\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for 2023 slightly during the course of the year. In its latest economic outlook, the IMF reported growth of 3.1% for the global economy in 2023, based on preliminary calculations. Growth was thus below the prior-year level (3.5%) but at the same time 0.2 percentage points above the IMF's original outlook in January 2023 (2.9%).\n\nThe IMF's calculations for Germany are in line with the preliminary figures of the country's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), which – at its \"GDP 2023\" press conference on January 15, 2024 – announced a decline in (price-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) of -0.3% for 2023. This is 2.1 percentage points less than in 2022 (1.8%). According to the Federal Statistical Office, this was due to further inflation-related high prices throughout the economy, unfavorable borrowing conditions caused by rising interest rates and an overall decline in both domestic and foreign demand.\n\nThanks to its stable and largely non-cyclical business model, United Internet made good progress again in the fiscal year 2023 – despite the aforementioned adverse macroeconomic conditions. The Company was able to achieve the sales and earnings targets it set itself, continuing its successful development with an increase in fee-based customer contracts of over 1 million to 28.49 million and sales growth of 5.0% to € 6.213 billion. At the same time, there was a further improvement in operating EBITDA – despite heavy investment in future topics – with an increase of 2.2% to around € 1.300 billion. This at first glance only moderate EBITDA growth was due in particular to planned increased costs for the construction of 1&1's mobile communications network. These rose to € -132.4 million, compared to € - 52.4 million in the previous year – a year-on-year increase of € -80.0 million.\n\nThe positive performance once again highlights the benefits of United Internet's business model based predominantly on electronic subscriptions with fixed monthly payments. This ensures stable and predictable revenues and cash flows, offers protection against cyclical influences and provides the financial scope to win new customers, expand existing customer relationships, and grasp opportunities in new business fields and new markets – organically or via investments and acquisitions.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company once again invested heavily in gaining and expanding customer relationships, as well as in developing new products – thus laying the basis for future growth.\n\nAs of the reporting date for the Annual Financial Statements 2023, and at the time of preparing this Management Report, the Management Board believes that the United Internet Group as a whole is well placed for its further development. It regards the financial position and performance – subject to possible special items – as positive and is optimistic about the Group's future prospects.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.4 Position of the Company\n\n# Earnings of United Internet AG\n\nAs a pure holding company, the earnings position of United Internet AG is usually dominated by its investment and financial result. In the fiscal year 2023, sales of the parent company amounted to € 1.1 million (prior year: € 0.7 million) and result mainly from services rendered to the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nOther operating income amounted to € 221.4 million (prior year: € 4.2 million). In addition to minimal income from internal charges to Group companies and the release of accruals, this mainly resulted from the disposal of financial investments of € 219.1 million from the sale of shares in Group subsidiary IONOS Group SE in the course of the IONOS IPO.\n\nOther operating expenses amounted to € 31.3 million (prior year: € 20.2 million) and mainly include expenses relating to internal charges for services rendered to Group companies, legal, auditing, and consulting fees, as well as non-period expenses.\n\nIncome from profit transfer agreements of € 101.9 million (prior year: € 90.6 million) resulted from profit transfers of 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE amounting to € 98.9 million (prior year: € 87.1 million), United Internet Corporate Services GmbH amounting to € 2.8 million (prior year: € 3.4 million), and United Internet Service SE amounting to € 0.1 million (prior year: € 0.1 million).\n\nIncome from investments amounted to € 0 (prior year: € 13.8 million). In the previous year, this item mainly comprised the dividends of 1&1 AG for 2021 and – due to the requirement at the time for sameperiod profit recognition – for 2022.\n\nExpenses for loss assumptions of € 19.2 million (prior year: € 6.2 million) related to the compensation expense of United Internet Investments Holding SE, United Internet Management Holding SE, and United Internet Corporate Holding SE.\n\nIncluding the special items from the above mentioned sale of IONOS shares, the parent company's result before taxes amounted to € 318.1 million (prior year: € 170.4 million).\n\nIncome taxes amounted to € 44.1 million (prior year: € 49.7 million).\n\nNet income in the separate financial statements of United Internet AG for the fiscal year 2023 – including special items (IONOS IPO) – amounted to € 274.0 million (prior year: € 120.7 million).\n\n# Assets and financial position of United Internet AG\n\nThe parent company's balance sheet total decreased from € 6,563.9 million as of December 31, 2022 to € 5,865.6 million on December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-current assets of the parent company amounting to € 4,832.2 million (prior year: € 5,816.9 million) were dominated by financial assets. Due to the sale of IONOS shares, shares in affiliated companies fell to € 4,132.2 million (prior year: € 4,221.9 million). Loans to affiliated companies declined to € 700.0 million (prior year: € 1,595.0 million), due in particular to the partial refinancing of the existing shareholder loan between United Internet AG and IONOS by means of a syndicated loan amounting to € 800 million. After consideration of further repayments during the fiscal year 2023 totaling € 95 million, the outstanding loan as at December 31, 2023 amounted to € 350 million.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent assets of the parent company amounting to € 1,033.4 million (prior year: € 746.9 million) comprise receivables due from affiliated companies and other assets. The receivables due from affiliated companies increased to € 1,010.6 million (prior year: € 724.8 million). Contrary to the previous year (comparable amount: € 618.0 million), these receivables are disclosed net in the balance sheet as of the fiscal year 2023. They mainly comprise receivables from sales tax grouping as part of the cash management system, as well as from profit transfer agreements. The rise in receivables due from affiliated companies is mainly the result of receivables due from the subsidiary 1&1 Versatel GmbH from cash management and reflects the company's increased investments in the fiber-optic network. Other assets amounting to € 22.7 million (prior year: € 19.3 million) consist mainly of receivables due from the tax office relating to audits of previous years.\n\nShareholders' equity of the parent company amounted to € 3,517.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 3,621.7 million). The decrease in equity during the reporting period is mainly due to the dividend payout of € 86.4 million and the purchase of treasury shares amounting to € 291.9 million, which are deducted from equity. There was an opposing effect from net income of € 274.0 million. The equity ratio rose from 55.2% in the previous year to 60.0% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe parent company's accruals of € 7.7 million (prior year: € 8.1 million) mainly comprise accrued taxes amounting to € 5.0 million (prior year: € 3.8 million), as well as other accrued liabilities for employee stock ownership plans, legal, auditing and consulting fees, bonuses, and other items totaling € 2.6 million (prior year: € 4.3 million).\n\nThe liabilities of the parent company are shaped in particular by liabilities due to banks and to affiliated companies. In the fiscal year 2023, liabilities to banks decreased to € 1,668.3 million (prior year: € 2,157.2 million). Bank liabilities mainly comprise three promissory note loans totaling € 1,162 million, syndicated loans totaling € 150 million, drawings from bilateral credit agreements of € 50 million, drawings from bilateral credit facilities of € 295 million, and interest of € 11.4 million. Liabilities to affiliated companies fell to € 564.0 million (prior year: € 757.6 million). As of the fiscal year 2023, these liabilities are disclosed net in the balance sheet. They mainly comprise liabilities from balances within the United Internet Group's cash pooling system, from sales tax grouping, and from profit and loss transfer agreements. Other liabilities of € 89.8 million (prior year: € 3.4 million) are mainly sales tax liabilities.\n\nCash flow of the parent company's financial statements is dominated by cash flows from the profit transfer agreements, as well as the dividends of investments.\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the current business situation of the parent company\n\nDue to its role as the Group's holding company, the economic position of United Internet AG at parent company level is mainly influenced by its investment and financial result. The above statements on the Group's economic position therefore also apply qualitatively for United Internet AG itself.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.5 Corporate Responsibility\n\nUnited Internet AG's Management Board and Supervisory Board consider it their responsibility to ensure the Company's continued existence and create sustainable value through responsible corporate management that takes a long-term perspective. For United Internet, running a business involves more than pursuing economic goals – it also has an obligation to society, the environment, employees, and other stakeholders.\n\nUnited Internet AG fulfills its disclosure obligations pursuant to the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – CSR-RUG) (sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with section 289c of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB)) and publishes a separate non-financial Group report as part of a separate sustainability report. In this Sustainability Report, the Company also complies with its reporting obligation under the EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and discloses its proportion of environmentally sustainable business activities accordingly.\n\nThe Company's Sustainability Report 2023 will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.unitedinternet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html) and thus fulfills the disclosure requirements of the CSR-RUG and the transparency requirements of stakeholders.\n\nThe separate non-financial Group report contains the statutory disclosures for the aspects \"environmental matters\" (chapter: Environmental Responsibility), \"employee-related matters\" and \"social matters\" (chapter: Social Responsibility), and \"respect for human rights\" and \"anti-corruption and bribery matters\" (chapter: Corporate Responsibility). This list of the minimum aspects required by the CSR-RUG has been supplemented by the chapter \"Digital Responsibility\", which is a material aspect for United Internet and also particularly relevant for the sector.\n\nIn addition to the CSR-RUG, reporting is based on the internationally recognized Sustainability Reporting Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) with the option: \"With reference to the GRI Standards\". Both the CSR-RUG and the GRI Standards expect information to be presented on how the material topics and their impacts are managed, and in particular the associated goals and measures, and the procedures used for risk identification and mitigation. In addition, the European Commission's Guidelines on non-financial reporting are applied, which build on Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups – the European Directive underlying the CSR-RUG.\n\nWhen defining the content, the materiality principle was applied. In 2022, a double materiality analysis was carried out to determine the material topics. Both the business relevance for United Internet and the potential and specific impact of the Company's activities on the environment and society were taken into account.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, the main focus was on preparing for the first CSRD reporting for the fiscal year 2024. A Group-wide project was driven forward in order to meet the reporting requirements of the new EU reporting obligation. The materiality matrix from the fiscal year 2023 formed the basis for the development of the future reporting strategy. A reconciliation to the CSRD requirements and a comprehensive gap analysis of the future quantitative and qualitative reporting obligations were conducted. The necessary transformation of the reporting system was initiated. As part of an evaluation project, the necessary processes, IT concepts and software solutions were reviewed in order to facilitate future data collection for all parties involved.\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board is responsible for examining the content of sustainability reporting. The Supervisory Board is supported in this by a \"limited assurance\" review of the separate non-financial Group report by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 3. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nThere were no significant events subsequent to the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023 which had a material effect on the financial position and performance or the accounting and reporting of the parent company or the Group.\n\nInformation on the economic position of the Group and Company at the time of preparing this Management Report are provided in chapter 4.3 \"Forecast report\".\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4. RISK, OPPORTUNITY AND FORECAST REPORT\n\nThe risk and opportunity policy of the United Internet Group is based on the objective of maintaining and sustainably enhancing the Company's values by utilizing opportunities while at the same time recognizing and managing risks from an early stage in their development. A risk and opportunity management system which is \"lived\" ensures that the United Internet Group (\"United Internet\") can exercise its business activities in a controlled company environment. The risk and opportunity management system regulates the responsible handling of those uncertainties which are always involved with economic activity.\n\n# 4.1 Risk report\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe concept, organization, and task of United Internet's risk management system are defined by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG, and documented in a risk management strategy and risk management manual which is valid for and available to all members of the Group. These requirements are regularly adapted to changing legal conditions and continuously developed. Corporate Risk Management coordinates the implementation and ongoing development of the risk management system and is responsible for the centrally managed risk management process on behalf of the Management Board. The risk management system covers only the Group's risks, while responsibility for the early and ongoing identification, evaluation, and management of opportunities lies directly with the Group Management Board and the operating management levels of the respective segments.\n\nCorporate Risk Management is supported by the risk management teams of the respective segments (Company Risk Management). In order to support Company Risk Management, additional local risk managers have been installed in business fields of particular importance for the Company's business success (such as the areas \"Technology & Development\"). In order to facilitate the Group-wide exchange and comparison of risk information, regular Risk Manager Meetings are held between the various risk managers and also with the Company-wide, cross-functional managers.\n\nThe Corporate Audit department regularly examines the functioning and efficiency of the risk management system. As part of his statutory auditing obligations for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, the external auditor also examines whether the risk early recognition system is generally suitable for the early identification of risks and developments which might endanger the Company so that suitable countermeasures can be swiftly introduced. The system complies with statutory requirements regarding risk early recognition systems, as well as with the version of the German Corporate Governance Code valid at the time of the last Declaration of Conformity of United Internet AG. Its design is based on the specifications of the ISO standard 31000:2018. In accordance with the regulations of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board also examines the efficacy of the risk management system.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Methods and objectives of risk management\n\nThe risk management system comprises those measures which enable United Internet to identify, classify in terms of money and scenario, steer, and monitor from an early stage all possible risks for the attainment of its corporate objectives with the aid of assessments and early warning systems. The aim of the Group-wide and IT-supported risk management system is to provide maximum transparency for management regarding the actual risk situation, its changes, and the available options for action so that a conscious decision can be taken to accept or avoid such risks. Risks endangering the Company must be avoided as a matter of principle. There is always an established indirect connection to central Group-wide risk management via the regular reporting channels throughout the Group and a direct connection for all major divisions. This ensures the completeness of registered risks in the risk management system.\n\nThe current status of the main risks is communicated to the Management Board and Supervisory Board four times per year.\n\nIdentified significant risks with an immediate impact and changes in the risk situation trigger an ad-hoc reporting obligation. The respective risk is then communicated immediately to the CFO of United Internet AG, who in turn reports it to the Supervisory Board where necessary. In this way, significant risks can be addressed as quickly as possible.\n\nRisks are assessed with their net impact, i.e., effects from mitigating measures are only considered in the risk assessment after their implementation.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Risks for the United Internet Group\n\nThe assessment of the overall risk situation is the result of a consolidated examination of all known material risks. Of the total risks identified for the Group, the following sections describe the main risk categories from the Company's point of view.\n\nThe starting point for assessing the materiality of risks is provided by the characteristics \"probability of occurrence\" and \"potential damage\". The potential damage comprises all negative influences on earnings. Based on the combination of probability of occurrence and potential damage, the risks are assigned as follows to one of three risk categories: \"Significant\", \"Moderate\", and \"Low\" risks.\n\n|                                         |                                                   | Very low<br>(0% - 5%) | Low<br>(> 5% - 20%) | High<br>(> 20% - 50%) | Very high<br>(> 50% - 100%) |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                         | Extremely high<br>(> € 200 million)               |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | Very high<br>(> € 100 million -<br>€ 200 million) |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | High<br>(> € 20 million -<br>€ 100 million)       |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| Potential damage                        | Low<br>(> € 5 million - € 20 million)             |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n|                                         | Very low<br>(€ 0 - € 5 million)                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| Probability of occurrence               |                                                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n| significant risk moderate risk low risk |                                                   |                       |                     |                       |                             |\n\nSpecific assessments of the Company's Management Board regarding the Group's risk situation, as well as the probability of occurrence, potential damage, and resulting categorization of the risks described below are provided at the end of this Risk Report.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Strategy**\n\n#### **Shareholdings & investments**\n\nThe acquisition and holding of shares in other companies and the making of strategic investments represent a key success factor for United Internet AG. In addition to improved access to existing and new growth markets, as well as to new technologies and know-how, investments also serve to exploit synergy and growth potential. However, these opportunities involve risks. For example, there is a risk that the targeted potential cannot be exploited as forecast or that acquired shareholdings will not develop as expected (non-scheduled write-downs/impairments, disposal losses, absence of dividend, or reduction of hidden reserves).\n\nAll investments are therefore subject to a continuous monitoring process by the Investment Management and are supported promptly if required. This risk is largely without relevance for EBITDA as, in the event of an incident, predominantly non-cash-effective impairments are incurred. The value of investments is continuously monitored by management and the Controlling division.\n\n#### **Business development & innovations**\n\nA further important success factor for United Internet is the development of new and constantly improved products and services in order to enhance sales and earnings, attract new customers, and expand existing customer relationships. There is always a risk, however, that new developments might be launched too late on the market or not be accepted by the target group as expected.\n\nUnited Internet counters such risks by constantly and closely observing market, product, and competition trends, as well as by undertaking product development which constantly responds to customer feedback.\n\nAs part of its efforts to diversify the business model or expand its value chain, United Internet occasionally enters new markets, or upstream and downstream markets. For example, the management board of 1&1 AG, a subsidiary of United Internet AG, decided with the approval of its supervisory board to establish and operate a high-performance 5G mobile network on the basis of the spectrum in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands it acquired in 2019. By establishing and operating its own network, the Company plans to further expand its value added in mobile communications, to tap new business fields, and to reduce its dependence on procuring wholesale services from other network operators.\n\n1&1 has enlisted in particular the services of the Japanese technology group and acclaimed OpenRAN expert Rakuten as general contractor for the rollout of its mobile communications network. Together with Rakuten, 1&1 is building a fully virtualized mobile network based on the innovative OpenRAN technology. The use of OpenRAN technology will reduce 1&1's dependence on network equipment suppliers. There are risks that the network rollout will not progress at the expected speed. Supply problems for the necessary hardware or delays in the search for sites are potential risks.\n\nIn selecting partners for the rollout of its network, 1&1 placed great importance on minimizing such risks. The general contractor and partner for active network technology Rakuten, for example, was the world's first and only network equipment supplier to establish a mobile communications network on the basis of the new OpenRAN technology in Japan. As a result, 1&1 can benefit from the experience and learning curve Rakuten gained during this time. The partners for passive technology are established and leading companies in Europe for radio tower infrastructure, enabling 1&1 to benefit from their existing infrastructure.\n\nNevertheless, initial delays in the construction of antenna locations already occurred in 2022 and 2023. These delays were due to supply problems of advance service providers. Delays in network rollout may\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nmean that more advance services have to be procured externally than planned in the period up to completion of the mobile network rollout, which would have a negative impact on value added.\n\nIn order to counter this risk appropriately, 1&1 entered into further partnerships for the acquisition of antenna locations and for its own construction of antenna locations, thus reducing the risk position.\n\n#### **Cooperation & outsourcing**\n\nSome operating divisions of United Internet work together with specialized cooperation and outsourcing partners in certain areas of the Company. The focus here is on objectives such as focusing on the actual core business, reducing costs, or leveraging the expertise of partners. These opportunities also involve risks in the form of dependencies on external service providers, as well as contractual and default risks.\n\nIn order to reduce these risks, detailed market analyses and due diligence reviews are carried out before major contracts are concluded with external service providers, and close and cooperative relationships are maintained with the cooperation and outsourcing partners after the contracts have been concluded.\n\n#### **Organizational structure & decision-making**\n\nThe choice of the appropriate organizational structure is essential for the efficiency and success of the Company. In addition to the organizational structure, business success depends to a large extent on making the right decisions. The basis for such decisions can be negatively influenced by various factors, such as limited flexibility offered by existing business processes and structures, or misunderstandings caused by ambiguities in the definition of key figures. If efficiency is jeopardized by one or several factors, this represents a strategic risk for United Internet which should be avoided wherever it makes economic sense.\n\nDue to the high degree of agility within the organization, United Internet considers itself to be generally well positioned in this respect and undertakes a number of measures to standardize and optimize processes, structures, and key figures.\n\nUnited Internet is not aware of any significant risks in this field at present.\n\n#### **Personnel development & retention**\n\nHighly skilled and well trained employees form the basis for the economic success of United Internet. In addition to the successful recruitment of qualified personnel (see also the \"personnel recruitment\" risk), personnel development and the long-term retention of top performers within the Company are strategically important. If the Company fails to develop and retain executives and employees with specialist or technological knowledge, there is the danger that United Internet may not be able to effectively conduct its business and achieve its growth targets. The concentrated accumulation of strategic knowledge and skills (so-called head monopoly) can have a considerable impact on the performance of the Company if the corresponding employee is no longer available.\n\nUnited Internet counteracts this risk by continuously nurturing employee and management skills. For example, it offers targeted measures for professional development, mentoring and coaching programs, as well as special offers for high potentials geared to talent development and retention and leadership skills.\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"HR Strategy and HR Organization\", \"Training and Education\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", as well as \"Occupational Health and Safety\", please refer to the chapter \"United Internet as an Employer\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which \n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nwill be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investorrelations/publications/reports.html).\n\n## **Market**\n\n#### **Sales market and competition**\n\nThe markets in which United Internet operates are characterized by strong and sustained competition. Depending on the strategy of the parties involved in the market, different effects may occur which may lead also involve adjustments to the Company's own business models or pricing policy. The entry of new competitors might also jeopardize market shares, growth targets, or margins. In addition, United Internet itself occasionally enters new, additional markets with large competitors. Such an entrepreneurial decision is always associated with new risks.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to minimize these risks by means of detailed planning based on internal experience and external market studies, as well as by constantly monitoring the market and the competition.\n\n#### **Procurement market**\n\nA gap in the procurement or delivery of resources required for business operations may also lead to bottlenecks or outages at United Internet. This applies both to the purchase of hardware and the purchase of wholesale services. Increases in the price of purchased products and services represent a risk for the targeted margins. Planned positive effects from contractually fixed price adjustment rounds can become a risk for the achievement of the Company's periodic targets due to time delays.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks by cooperating with several long-term service providers and suppliers, contractual obligations, and – where it makes economic sense – by expanding its own value chain. Although significant and unforeseeable developments on the procurement market as a result of events such as the Ukraine war cannot be fully offset, they can be countered by taking preventive measures such as rapidly restocking inventories.\n\n#### **Financial market**\n\nUnited Internet's activities are fundamentally exposed to risks on the financial market. In particular, these include risks from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.\n\n#### **Interest**\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest risks as the major share of its borrowing bears variable interest rates with varying terms. As part of its liquidity planning, the Company constantly monitors the various investment possibilities and debt conditions. Any borrowing requirements are met by using suitable instruments to manage liquidity. Surplus cash is invested on the money market to achieve the best possible return. Due to developments on the global finance markets, i.e., adjustments to central bank interest rates around the world, there was a slight increase in the interest rate risk, but at the same time opportunities from more attractive investment options. Market interest rate changes might have an adverse effect on the interest result and are included in our calculation of sensitive factors affecting earnings. In order to present market risks, United Internet has developed a sensitivity analysis which shows the impact of hypothetical changes to relevant risk variables on pretax earnings. The reporting period effects are illustrated by applying these hypothetical changes in risk variables to the stock of financial instruments as of the balance sheet date. The Company regularly reviews the possibility of interest rate hedging in order to mitigate the negative effects of rising interest rates.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Currency**\n\nThe currency risk predominantly results from operations (if revenue and/or expenses are in a currency other than the Group's functional currency) and its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Personnel recruitment market**\n\nIt is essential for United Internet that human resources are effectively controlled so that the Company can ensure its short- and long-term needs for staff and the requisite expertise. If it is unable to attract managers and employees with specialist and technological knowledge, United Internet would not be able to effectively conduct its business and achieve its growth targets.\n\nIn recent years, the shortage of skilled workers has become an increasingly important issue. As an attractive employer, however, United Internet believes it is well placed to hire highly skilled specialists and managers with the potential to drive its business success in the future. This was confirmed in the past years by the Top Employers Institute, which awarded United Internet the accolade \"Top Employer 2023\".\n\nFor further information on topics such as \"HR Strategy and HR Organization\", \"Training and Education\", \"Diversity and Equal Opportunities\", as well as \"Occupational Health and Safety\", please refer to the chapter \"United Internet as an Employer\" in the Sustainability Report 2023 of United Internet AG, which will be published in late March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investorrelations/publications/reports.html).\n\n## **Provision of services**\n\n#### **Work processes**\n\nIn view of the ever-increasing complexity and interoperability of the products offered, there are steadily growing demands placed on the development of internal work processes. This also involves an ever-higher degree of coordination The particular challenge is to ensure quality standards especially in view of fast-changing market events – and on numerous differing domestic and foreign markets.\n\nThe Company counters these risks by continuously developing and enhancing its internal processes, pooling and retaining its experts and key personnel, and continuously optimizing its organizational structures.\n\n#### **Information security**\n\nUnited Internet generates its commercial success largely in the telecommunications market and within the environment of the internet. In order to provide products and services, the Company uses information and telecommunication technologies (data centers, transmission systems, connection nodes, etc.) in its business processes which are closely networked with the internet and whose availability may be endangered by threats from the internet.\n\nIn order to continue to deal with such risks quickly, the existing monitoring, building access, and alarm system, together with the necessary processes and documentation, is continuously optimized.\n\nThere is also the risk of hacker attacks with the aim of stealing or deleting customer data, or using services fraudulently. In the fiscal year 2023, an increasing professionalization of the attackers and their attack methods was observed once again. According to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the number of new malicious program variants detected daily reached an average of 250,000 in the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. In connection with the war in Ukraine, pro-Russian hacktivist attacks were seen as a threat, although they did not cause any lasting damage and were regarded more as a propaganda tool.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnited Internet counters this risk with the aid of virus scanners, firewalling concepts, self-initiated tests, and various technical monitoring mechanisms.\n\nThe threat potential of the internet is one of the largest threat groups for United Internet with regard to its effects, which are all monitored and reduced by numerous technical and organizational measures. Of particular relevance in this respect are the operation and continuous improvement of the security management system and the steady enhancement of system resilience.\n\n#### **Capacity bottlenecks**\n\nDue to temporary or permanent shortages of technical resources, e.g., due to the temporary overloading of systems or a lack of resources to operate data centers, existing capacities might be exceeded and consequently the planned provision of services could be jeopardized, threatening a corresponding loss of sales. Risks from the procurement of resources, such as products or services on the market, are not taken into account here.\n\nIn order to counter these marginally increased risks, several internal stores are maintained which are continuously adapted to delivery times on the global market. In addition, the Company is in close contact with energy suppliers, for example, in order to coordinate emergency concepts regarding the data centers. In the case of outages, these can be compensated for at short notice by implementing the aforementioned measures.\n\n#### **Projects**\n\nThe classic project objectives of quality, time, and budget are defined before or at the start of a project and are thus the subject of entrepreneurial planning. If potential risks already become apparent in the course of planning or project design or if negative deviations from these plans become apparent in the course of a project's implementation, these are recorded as risks. Moreover, projects may also involve risks that do not affect the project itself but arise after the project has been completed (e.g., security vulnerabilities in new software code).\n\n1&1 faces a variety of technical project risks as part of the construction and operation of its mobile network. The challenge is to migrate all customers to the company's own network within the next two years. If this does not succeed as planned, it could lead to dissatisfaction among the customers affected and ultimately to customer losses. 1&1 launched its customer migration projects at an early stage and developed concepts together with its partners to ensure the success of the customer migration.\n\nActive project management ensures that risk-reducing measures are already implemented during the project. In addition to maintaining the current professional project management, the Company reduces the aforementioned risks by holding regular specialist project management training courses, in order to improve such aspects as security or data privacy requirements. Project objectives are also closely monitored by management and the Controlling division.\n\n#### **Technical plant operation**\n\nUnited Internet's products and related business processes are based on a complex technical infrastructure and a number of success-critical software systems (servers, customer relationship databases, and statistics systems, etc.). Constantly adapting this infrastructure to changing customer needs leads to greater complexity and regular changes. In addition to major events, like the migration of databases, this may lead to various disruptions or defects. Should this affect our business systems or their databases, for example, daily account debiting may be delayed or no longer possible. Should this affect our performance systems, for example, United Internet may not be able to provide its customers with the promised service, on a temporary or longer-term basis.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company meets these risks by making targeted adjustments to the architecture, introducing quality assurance measures, and establishing spatially separated (geo-redundant) core functionalities.\n\nFor the operation of systems, there is a risk of targeted attacks from inside and outside the Company, e.g., from hackers or manipulation by staff with access rights, which may result in non-availability or a deterioration of services.\n\nIn order to counter this risk, the Company takes a wide variety of software- and hardware-based safety precautions to protect the infrastructure and its availability. By dividing responsibilities, the Company has made sure that activities or business transactions involving risks are not carried out by single employees but on the basis of the \"double-check principle\". Manual and technical access restrictions also ensure that employees may only operate within their particular area of responsibility. As an additional precautionary measure against data loss, all data are regularly backed up and stored in separate, i.e., geo-redundant, data centers.\n\n## **Compliance**\n\n#### **Data privacy**\n\nIt can never be fully ruled out that data privacy regulations may be contravened, e.g., by human error or technical weaknesses. In such cases, United Internet faces fines and the loss of customer confidence.\n\nUnited Internet stores the data of its customers on servers according to international security standards at its own and at rented data centers. The handling of these data is subject to extensive legal regulations.\n\nThe Company is aware of this great responsibility and attaches a high degree of importance and care to data privacy. By using state-of-the-art technologies, continuously monitoring all data-privacy and other legal regulations, providing extensive staff training, and involving data protection aspects and requirements as early as possible in product development, United Internet continuously invests in improving the standard of its data privacy.\n\n#### **Misconduct & irregularities**\n\nNon-compliance with legal regulations may result in legal consequences and fines. In order to ensure compliance with legal regulations and internal guidelines, the Management Board of United Internet AG has set up a Group-wide risk-oriented Compliance Management System (CMS).\n\nIn the reporting period, the CMS was further developed, particularly in terms of its organizational structure, and Corporate Compliance at the level of the Group's parent company was more closely integrated with the segment compliance units at the level of the four segments Consumer Access, Business Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications. This led to a reduction in risk.\n\n#### **Legislation & regulation**\n\nChanges in existing legislation, the enactment of new laws, and changes in government regulation issues may have unexpected negative effects on the business models pursued by United Internet and their further development. The decisions of the Federal Network Agency and the Federal Cartel Office have an influence on network access and the pricing of internet access tariffs. As United Internet purchases advance services for its own customers, regulatory changes may have a negative impact on the profitability of its own tariffs. In the same way, there is also the possibility that a lack of regulation may lead to a deterioration of market circumstances for United Internet.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n1&1's frequency acquisition in 2019 was tied to the fulfillment of certain regulatory requirements. Among other things, 1&1 was obliged to put 1,000 5G base stations into operation by the end of 2022, distributed proportionately across Germany's federal states. Due to delivery difficulties of the upstream providers commissioned by 1&1 to provide the antenna locations, 1&1 had fallen well short of this target by the end of 2022. Compliance with the frequency requirements is closely monitored by the Federal Network Agency. Non-compliance may result in a fine and, in the worst case, the revocation of frequency usage rights. As a result of the failure to meet the rollout target by the end of 2022, the Federal Network Agency is currently considering a corresponding sanction in the form of a fine. Moreover, there are requirements that the mobile communications network must cover 25 percent of households by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030. Failure to meet these targets could also result in fines or, in the worst case, the withdrawal of frequencies.\n\nIn connection with the construction of a high-performance 5G mobile network, 1&1 is dependent on the allocation of relevant frequencies by the Federal Network Agency. Low-band frequencies are expected to be reallocated in 2026. There is a risk that 1&1 will not be included in the allocation of these frequencies and that instead the frequency allocation to the established network operators will be prolonged. In this case, 1&1 would be forced to purchase a higher volume of advance services, which would have a negative impact on its value creation. Due to their physical properties, low-band frequencies have a greater range and better penetration capacity than high-band frequencies and thus enable cost-effective coverage in rural areas with mobile phone masts located far apart from each other while also ensuring good reception inside buildings. Without access to these low-band frequencies with a greater range, the risk of failing to meet the Federal Network Agency's expansion obligations by the end of 2025 would also increase considerably.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to counter this tendency toward an increasing regulation risk by cooperating with various pre-service providers and by actively participating in the activities of industry associations.\n\n#### **Litigation**\n\nUnited Internet is currently involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings arising from its normal business activities. The outcome is by definition uncertain and thus represents a risk. Insofar as the prospects of success are negative in specific cases and the size of the obligation can be reliably estimated, accruals are formed for such risks from litigation.\n\nIn 2019, an advance service provider filed claims against 1&1 in the low three-digit million range (for the purposes of internal classification, amounts of up to € 333 million are defined as being in the low threedigit million range, and the claims filed do not exceed this amount in total). 1&1 considers the claims of the respective counterparty to be unfounded and regards an outflow of resources as unlikely.\n\n#### **Tax risks**\n\nAs an internationally operating company, United Internet is subject to the tax laws applicable in the respective countries. Risks may arise from changes in tax laws and double taxation agreements, or case law, as well as from differences in the interpretation of existing regulations. Compared to December 31, 2022, there has been an increase in this risk field. This is due to new knowledge regarding sales and income tax risks, among other things, and the associated revaluation of the risk assessment.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks by continuously expanding its existing tax management system.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Finance**\n\n#### **Financing**\n\nThe main financial liabilities incurred by United Internet AG for the financing of its activities include bank loans, overdraft facilities, and other financial liabilities. Some of the bank loans are subject to financial covenants. Non-compliance with these covenants can have a negative impact on the financing of the United Internet Group. In extreme cases, a loan might be terminated. As of the balance sheet date, the Company almost exclusively held primary financial instruments.\n\nThe aim of financial risk management is to limit risks through ongoing operating and financial activities.\n\n#### **Fraud & credit default**\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of dynamic customer growth and provide services as quickly as possible in the interests of its customers, United Internet has largely automated its order and provision processes – as have many other companies in such mass market businesses. The nature of such automated processes provides possibilities for attacks from fraudsters. Due to the strong appeal of the products and services offered, not only the number of customers is increasing but also the number of non-payers and fraudsters. Consequently, the amount of credit default has risen.\n\nUnited Internet attempts to prevent such fraud attacks – or at least to recognize and end them at an early stage – by permanently expanding its fraud management capabilities, working closely with preservice providers, and taking account of such risks in the design of its products.\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nThe general liquidity risk of United Internet AG consists of the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its financial obligations, such as the redemption of financial debts. The Company's objective is to continuously cover its financial needs and secure flexibility, for example by using overdraft facilities and loans.\n\nGroup-wide cash requirements and surpluses are managed centrally by the cash management system. By netting these cash requirements and surpluses within the Group, the amount of external bank transactions can be minimized. This is managed, e.g., by using cash pooling processes. The Company has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank accounts and internal netting accounts, as well as for the execution of automated payment transactions. In addition to operating liquidity, United Internet AG also holds other liquidity reserves, which are available at short notice.\n\n## **Acts of God**\n\nExternal events such as natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, etc.), personnel crises (pandemics, strikes, etc.), infrastructure crises (power outages, road damage, etc.), or violent incidents (rampage, terrorist attacks, war, etc.) may affect United Internet's operations.\n\nUnited Internet counters these risks as far as possible with a variety of measures. Examples include the establishment of building access restrictions, the operation of georedundant data centers, or hygiene precautions, location-independent workplaces, the use of modern communication media to avoid travel, and the elaboration of emergency concepts.\n\nThe latter has become more important as a result of the growing geopolitical tensions. The United Internet Group has taken this as an opportunity to revise its existing security measures and concepts and, if necessary, to adapt them to the higher threat levels.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Additional disclosures on risks, financial instruments, and financial risk management** \n\nFurther details on risks, financial instruments, and financial risk management are provided in note 43 \"Objectives and methods of financial risk management\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Additional disclosures on sustainability risks**\n\nInformation on sustainability risks can be found in the Sustainability Report 2023, which will be published at the end of March 2024 (at https://www.united-internet.de/investorrelations/publikationen/berichte.html).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's risk position\n\nThe assessment of the overall level of risk is based on a consolidated view of all significant risk fields and individual risks, also taking account of their interdependencies.\n\n- From the current perspective, the main challenges are the risk fields \"Legislation & regulation\", \"Litigation\", \"Information security\", and \"Technical plant operation\".\n- The risk assessment of the risk field \"Personnel recruitment\" rose from Low to Moderate. The background to this change is the difficulty of attracting the required IT specialists.\n- There was also an increase from Low to Moderate for the risk field \"Capacity bottlenecks\". This was due to a slightly increased risk in the Business Applications segment.\n- And there was an increase in the risk field \"Tax risks\" from Low to Moderate. The reason for this increase is enhanced risk awareness, which has led to an increased identification of risks in this field.\n- The risk assessment of the risk field \"Business development & innovations\" could be reduced from Moderate to Low. The background to this reduction is an improved risk position in the Consumer Access segment.\n- Thanks to the implementation of measures and the closure of risks, the risk field \"Misconduct & irregularities\" has also fallen from Moderate to Low.\n- Otherwise, the risk classifications of the risk fields of United Internet AG as at December 31, 2023 were unchanged from December 31, 2022.\n\nThe continuous expansion of its risk management system enables the United Internet Group to limit risks to a minimum, where economically sensible, by implementing specific measures.\n\nCompared to the previous year, there was an increase in the overall risk. In addition to the aforementioned risk fields \"Tax risks\", \"Personnel recruitment\", and \"Capacity bottlenecks\", the main risk increases were in the fields of \"Litigation\" and \"Procurement market\", although the increase in the latter two risk areas did not lead to an overall increase in the risk classification.\n\nIn the assessment of the overall risk situation, the existing opportunities in the United Internet Group were not taken into consideration. There were no risks which directly jeopardized the continued existence of the United Internet Group in the fiscal year 2023, nor as of the preparation date for this Management Report, neither from individual risk positions nor from the overall risk situation.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Probability of occurrence, potential damage, and the classification of risks

|\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nSociety, politics and the economy are currently facing complex macroeconomic challenges resulting from a combination of high interest rates, subdued growth expectations, a tense financing framework, falling trade growth and declining confidence among companies and consumers. In addition to the destabilizing effects of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East is also contributing to greater uncertainty about the economic future. The United Internet Group is responding to this by actively accepting the current challenges and integrating them into its business decisions, in particular by developing strategies to minimize risk, such as reducing the proportion of variable-interest debt or through diversified procurement strategies to ensure a secure and fair energy supply.\n\nAlthough the United Internet Group has no business activities in the countries involved in the wars, it is still confronted with the indirect effects. In view of the uncertain security situation caused by the war in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, especially surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, and the potential indirect effects on global business activities, United Internet has developed proactive risk management and mitigation strategies:\n\n- Cybersecurity risks: due to the increased cybersecurity threats associated with the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, the Company is stepping up its investment in cybersecurity measures. These include the use of advanced monitoring technologies, conducting regular security audits and training employees to improve their resistance to cyberattacks.\n- Hardware bottlenecks: the Company is adapting its logistics and procurement strategies in order to overcome potential hardware bottlenecks that could be caused by the uncertain security situation surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, exacerbated by the war in the Middle East. Among other things, this is being done by increasing the stock of hardware in order to cushion potential supply disruptions.\n\nThe Management Board and the operational managers will closely monitor further developments and initiate any appropriate countermeasures (if possible).\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4.2 Opportunity report\n\n## Opportunity management\n\nOpportunity management is based on strategic planning and the resulting measures for the development of products and their positioning for various target groups, markets, and countries during the product life cycle.\n\nThe Group Management Board, as well as the operative management level of the respective business segments, have the direct responsibility for the early and continuous identification, assessment, and steering of opportunities.\n\nThe management team of United Internet AG makes extensive use of detailed evaluations, models, and scenarios on current and future trends regarding sectors, technologies, products, markets/market potential, and competitors in the Group's fields of activity. The potential opportunities identified during these strategic analyses are then examined with regard to the critical success factors and existing external conditions and possibilities of United Internet AG in planning discussions between the Management Board, Supervisory Board, and operational managers before being implemented in the form of specific measures, targets, and milestones.\n\nThe progress and success of these measures is continuously monitored by operational management, as well as the managing directors and management board members of the respective companies.\n\n# Opportunities for United Internet\n\nUnited Internet's stable and largely non-cyclical business model ensures predictable revenues and cash flows, thus providing the financial flexibility to grasp opportunities in new business fields and markets – organically or via investments and acquisitions.\n\n## **Broad strategic positioning in growth markets**\n\nIn view of its broad positioning in current growth markets, the Company's purely strategic growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, permanently available, and increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. From the current perspective, these internet-based programs for home users, freelancers, and small companies are likely to be United Internet's growth drivers over the coming years – both as stand-alone products in the Consumer Applications and Business Applications segments, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in our Consumer Access segment.\n\n## **Participation in market growth**\n\nDespite the uncertain macroeconomic conditions, United Internet – as well as many of the sector's leading analysts – expects further progress in those markets of importance to the Company. United Internet is one of the leading players in these markets. At home and abroad. With its highly competitive Access products, its growing portfolio of cloud applications, its strong and specialized brands, its high sales strength, and already established business relationships with millions of private and business\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\ncustomers (cross-selling and up-selling potential), United Internet is also well positioned to participate in the expected market growth of both its business divisions.\n\n## **Expansion of market positions**\n\nUnited Internet AG is now one of the leaders in many of its business fields. Based on its existing technological know-how, its high level of product and service quality, the widespread popularity of Group brands such as 1&1, GMX or WEB.DE, its business relationships with millions of private and business customers, and its high customer retention ratio, United Internet sees good opportunities to build on its current market shares.\n\n## **Entry into new business fields**\n\nOne of United Internet's core competencies is to recognize customer wishes, trends, and thus new markets at an early stage. With its broadly based value chain (from product development and data center operation, to effective marketing, powerful sales organization, and active customer support), United Internet is often faster at placing innovations on the market and – thanks to the high level of cash generation in its existing business fields – capable of providing them with strong marketing support.\n\n## **Use of artificial intelligence (AI)**\n\nThe potential of AI applications is immense, particularly in the IT sector. United Internet uses AI to optimize processes and increase efficiency, for example by automating routine tasks in software development, customer service and marketing as well as for the analysis of large data volumes.\n\nHowever, there are also many opportunities at product level for companies such as United Internet to use AI to optimize existing products for their customers or to develop new products in the field of AI in order to acquire new customers and increase customer loyalty. For example, IONOS helps its customers build their websites with the aid of an AI website generator. This enables customers to independently generate website suggestions in a matter of seconds based on just a few details (such as sector and relevant keywords) – AI takes care of the design, images, texts, and search engine optimization.\n\n## **Extending vertical integration: own landline infrastructure**\n\nSince its acquisition of 1&1 Versatel (2014), United Internet operates its own telecommunications network, which is being constantly expanded. With a current length of over 61,000 km, it is one of Germany's largest fiber-optic networks. This network infrastructure gives United Internet the opportunity to extend its vertical integration and also gradually reduce its purchases of wholesale broadband services for the B2C segment.\n\nIn addition, having its own network also offers United Internet the opportunity to systematically expand its B2B data and infrastructure business with SMEs and large corporations. The scale of this opportunity is underlined by the considerable pent-up demand for direct fiber-optic connections in Germany. According to the latest survey of the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) in December 2022, only 9.2% (end of 2021: 7.1%) of all broadband connections in Germany are fiberoptic connections. Germany therefore still lags well behind in 36th place among the 38 OECD countries\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nsurveyed, and is well below the leaders Korea (88.0%), Japan (84.8%), and Spain (83.1%), as well as below the OECD average of 37.7% (end of 2021: 34.3%).\n\n## **Extending vertical integration: rollout of own mobile communications network**\n\nWith the launch of mobile services in 1&1's mobile network in December 2023, United Internet's subsidiary 1&1 established the key prerequisites for extending its vertical integration in this market segment – as in the landline segment. 1&1 has since been producing advance services for new customers in its own network. Wherever 1&1 does not yet have sufficient network coverage during the network rollout, it uses the national roaming advance services of Telefónica. As of summer 2024, these national roaming advance services are to be provided by Vodafone. National roaming is a standard procedure used in the rollout of new mobile networks that enables customers to surf and make calls without interruption in areas not yet covered during the construction phase of the new network. This is achieved by automatically using the roaming partner's antennas in these areas.\n\nUntil the launch of mobile services on its own network, 1&1 had extensive access to Telefónica's mobile network in Germany (as a so-called MBA MVNO) and also used capacities from other advance service providers such as Vodafone. As of the beginning of 2024, 1&1's existing customers on these third-party networks are being gradually migrated to the 1&1 mobile network in order to increasingly replace the purchase of advance services from third parties and instead use internally produced advance services.\n\nDespite the initial delay in the rollout of antenna locations, 1&1 is still pursuing its goal of covering a quarter of German households by the end of 2025 and half by the end of 2030. To this end, additional partners have been acquired for the network rollout. The company therefore expects to make up for the delays in the course of the rollout phase.\n\n## **High degree of vertical integration for applications**\n\nIn its Applications segment, United Internet covers the entire value creation chain. Applications are developed at the Company's own \"Internet Factories\" or in cooperation with partner firms and operated on over 100,000 servers at the Company's 11 own data centers and 21 co-locations. This enables United Internet to maintain high quality standards and to respond quickly to customer needs and changing market situations in order to win new customers and retain existing ones.\n\n## **Internationalization**\n\nCloud applications can be used anywhere in the world and work on the same principle in Frankfurt as they do in London, Rome, or New York. In the past, United Internet has already successfully adapted cloud products many times to various languages and country-specific features and gradually rolled them out in different nations.\n\nThanks to the high degree of exportability which these products offer, United Internet is already active in its Applications segment in numerous European countries (Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden), as well as in North America (USA, Canada, and Mexico). Further countries and product rollouts will gradually follow.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Acquisitions and investments**\n\nIn addition to organic growth, United Internet also constantly examines the possibility of company acquisitions and strategic investments. Thanks to its high and plannable level of free cash flow, United Internet also has a strong source of internal funding and good access to debt financing markets in order to utilize opportunities in the form of acquisitions and investments.\n\nUnited Internet has enhanced its market standing in Germany and abroad, for example, by making several acquisitions and strategic investments while gaining considerable expertise in the field of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and company integration. The most important M&A activities of the past include the acquisition of WEB.DE's portal business (in 2005), the acquisitions of Fasthosts (2006) and united-domains (2008), the acquisition of freenet's broadband business (2009), and the acquisitions of mail.com (2010), Arsys (2013), Versatel (2014; now 1&1 Versatel), home.pl (2015), STRATO (2017), ProfitBricks (2017; now IONOS Cloud), Drillisch (2017; now 1&1), World4You (2018), and we22 (2021). The most important strategic investments include the investments in Open-Xchange (2013), uberall (2014), Tele Columbus (2016), rankingCoach (2017), AWIN (2017; via the contribution of affilinet), and Stackable (2021).\n\n# Management Board's overall assessment of the Group's opportunity position\n\nIn view of its broad positioning in current growth markets, the Company's growth opportunities are clearly apparent: universally accessible, permanently available, and increasingly powerful broadband connections are enabling new and more sophisticated cloud applications. From the current perspective, these internet-based programs for home users, freelancers, and small companies are likely to be United Internet’s growth drivers over the coming years – both as stand-alone products in the Consumer Applications and Business Applications segments, as well as in combination with landline and mobile access products in the Consumer Access segment. Based predominantly on electronic subscriptions with fixed monthly amounts and contractually agreed terms, United Internet's business model ensures stable and plannable revenue and cash flows. Against this backdrop, the Company's Management Board is convinced that it will continue to be in a position to deal successfully with challenges and seize opportunities.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4.3 Forecast report\n\n## Expectations for the economy\n\nIn its global economic outlook published on January 30, 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) updated its forecasts for the development of the global economies in 2024 and 2025. In view of the current fall in inflation and the recent upturn in growth, the IMF raised the forecast for the global economy in its update from 2.9% to 3.1% for 2024 (after 3.1% in 2023). Nevertheless, global economic growth will once again fall well short of the average figure for recent years of 3.8%. For 2025, the IMF forecasts global economic growth of 3.2%.\n\nAccording to the IMF, there are risks associated with geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, which have already led to a significant increase in prices for freight shipments between Asia and Europe.\n\nThe latest IMF forecasts for United Internet's target markets in North America (the USA, Canada, and Mexico) are as follows: the US economy is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025 (after 2.5% in 2023); in Canada, economic growth of 1.4% and 2.3% is anticipated for 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 1.1% in 2023); and the Mexican economy is expected to grow by 2.7% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025 (after 3.4% in 2023).\n\nThe IMF anticipates growth of 0.9% and 1.7% in the eurozone for 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 0.5% in 2023).\n\nLikewise, the IMF expects no more than minor economic growth in United Internet's main EU markets (France, Spain, and Italy): the economists anticipate growth of 1.0% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025 for France (after 0.8% in 2023); growth in Spain is expected to reach 1.5% and 2.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 2.4% in 2023); and for Italy, the IMF forecasts growth of 0.7% and 1.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively (after 0.6% in 2023).\n\nFor the non-EU country the UK, the IMF expects an increase in economic output of 0.6% in 2024 and growth of 1.6% in 2025 (after 0.5% in 2023).\n\nFor United Internet's most important market, Germany, the IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 (after -0.3% in 2023). According to the outlooks, Germany is likely to have the lowest growth of all G7 states again in 2024.\n\nWith expected growth of 0.5% in 2024, the IMF is above the forecast of the German government, which, in its 2024 Annual Economic Report on February 21, 2024, forecast growth for price-adjusted gross domestic product of just 0.2% in 2024.\n\nThe German government cites the ongoing geopolitical crises, the impact of the energy price crisis, the overall distinct weakness of the global economy and the increasingly noticeable effects of restrictive monetary policy as the reasons for this estimate.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n|          | 2025e | 2024e | 2023  |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| World    | 3.2%  | 3.1%  | 3.1%  |\n| USA      | 1.7%  | 2.1%  | 2.5%  |\n| Canada   | 2.3%  | 1.4%  | 1.1%  |\n| Mexico   | 1.5%  | 2.7%  | 3.4%  |\n| Eurozone | 1.7%  | 0.9%  | 0.5%  |\n| France   | 1.7%  | 1.0%  | 0.8%  |\n| Spain    | 2.1%  | 1.5%  | 2.4%  |\n| Italy    | 1.1%  | 0.7%  | 0.7%  |\n| Poland   | 3.2%  | 2.8%  | 0.6%  |\n| UK       | 1.6%  | 0.6%  | 0.5%  |\n| Germany  | 1.6%  | 0.5%  | -0.3% |\n\n**Market forecast: GDP development of most important economies for United Internet** \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Update), January 2024\n\n# Sector/market expectations\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the adverse macroeconomic conditions, disrupted supply chains, and the shortage of skilled workers, the industry association Bitkom expects the German ICT market as a whole to grow by 4.4% (prior year: 2.0%) to € 224.3 billion in 2024.\n\nAccording to Bitkom calculations, the IT market is expected to grow again – after a brief dip in growth in 2023 – by 6.1% (prior year: 2.2%) to € 151.5 billion in 2024. Driven in particular by cloud and AI technologies, software is likely to be the fastest-growing segment again with a strong increase of 9.4% (prior year: 9.6%) to € 45.5 billion. Growth of 4.8% (prior year: 5.1%) to € 51.7 billion is expected for the IT services business, which also includes IT consulting. And sales of IT hardware are also set for a return to significant growth with an expected increase of 4.6% (prior year: -5.4%) to € 54.5 billion. The strongest growth driver is still Infrastructure-as-Service, i.e., rented servers, network and storage capacities.\n\nBy contrast, the consumer electronics market will remain under pressure. According to a Bitkom forecast, sales are likely to decline again in 2024 by an estimated -3.4% (prior year: -2.1%) to € 7.8 billion.\n\nThe most important ICT markets for United Internet's business model are the German telecommunications market (broadband connections and mobile internet) for its mostly subscriptionfinanced Access division, and the global cloud computing and German online advertising markets for its subscription- and ad-financed Applications division.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Telecommunications market in Germany**\n\nThe industry association Bitkom expects the German telecommunications market to grow in total by 1.0% (prior year: 1.7%) to € 72.8 billion. The strongest growth in this segment is expected to come from business with telecommunications services, which is set to grow by 1.6% (prior year: 1.9%) to € 52.6 billion. Total spending on telecommunications infrastructure is expected to decrease slightly by -1.0% (prior year: 4.4%) to € 8.4 billion. Sales of end-user devices are likely to be on a par with the previous year with a slight decline of -0.2% (prior year: -0.7%) to € 11.8 billion.\n\n#### **Market forecast: telecommunications market in Germany**\n\n| in € billion | 2024e | 2023 | Change |\n|--------------|-------|------|--------|\n| Sales        | 72.8  | 72.1 | + 1.0% |\n\nSource: Bitkom, January 2024\n\n## **Global cloud computing market**\n\nFollowing the very strong growth of 2023 (17.8%), Gartner forecasts global growth for public cloud services of 20.4% to USD 678.79 billion in 2024.\n\n#### **Market forecast: global cloud computing**\n\n| in \\$ billion                                      | 2024e  | 2023   | Change  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Global sales of public cloud services              | 678.79 | 563.59 | + 20.4% |\n| thereof Application Infrastructure Services (PaaS) | 176.49 | 145.32 | + 21.5% |\n| thereof Application Services (SaaS)                | 243.99 | 205.22 | + 18.9% |\n| thereof Business Process Services (BPaaS)          | 72.92  | 66.34  | + 9.9%  |\n| thereof Desktop as a Service (DaaS)                | 3.16   | 2.78   | + 13.5% |\n| thereof System Infrastructure Services (IaaS)      | 182.22 | 143.93 | + 26.6% |\n\nSource: Gartner, Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update, November 2023\n\n## **Online advertising market in Germany**\n\nAfter a 7.0% increase in online advertising in 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers expects further growth in 2024 with an increase in total market volume (mobile advertising and desktop advertising) of 5.3% to € 14.18 billion.\n\n#### **Market forecast: total online advertising market in Germany (mobile advertising & desktop advertising) – acc. to PwC**\n\n| in € billion                | 2024e | 2023  | Change |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Online advertising revenues | 14.18 | 13.47 | + 5.3% |\n\nSource: PricewaterhouseCoopers, German Entertainment and Media Outlook 2023 – 2027, September 2023\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Expectations for the Company in 2024\n\n## **Forecast for the fiscal year 2024**\n\n- United Internet AG expects an increase in consolidated sales (acc. to IFRS) to approx. € 6.5 billion for its fiscal year 2024 (2023: € 6.213 billion).\n- Operating EBITDA (acc. to IFRS) is expected to grow to € 1.42 billion in 2024 (2023: € 1.300 billion).\n\nThe Company will continue to invest heavily in 2024, especially in the expansion of its fiber-optic network and mobile communications network. Cash capital expenditures are likely to be 10 - 20% above the prior-year figure (2023: € 756 million).\n\nDue to its role as a holding company, the earnings of United Internet AG at parent company level are mainly influenced by its investment result (profit transfers and dividends) and the interest result. From the current perspective (subject to possible special items), the Management Board expects a balanced net income for the fiscal year 2024 (2023: € 274.0 million including special items of € 219.1 million from the IONOS IPO).\n\nUnited Internet AG intends to maintain its shareholder-friendly dividend policy based on continuity in the coming years. Dividend payouts will continue to represent approx. 20 - 40% of adjusted net income from continued operations after minority interests (adjusted net income attributable to \"shareholders of United Internet AG” — according to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income) in the future. The prerequisite is that funds are not required for further Company development.\n\n## **Management Board's overall statement on the anticipated development**\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG is upbeat about its prospects for the future. Thanks to a business model based predominantly on electronic subscriptions, United Internet believes it is largely stable enough to withstand cyclical influences. And with the investments made over the past few years in customer relationships, new business fields and further internationalization, as well as via acquisitions and investments, the Company has broadened the foundations for further growth.\n\nUnited Internet will continue to pursue this sustainable business policy in the coming years. The segments will focus on the following topics:\n\n- In addition to the rollout of the 1&1 mobile network, the Consumer Access segment will focus in particular on marketing mobile internet products and winning high-quality customer relationships in the fiscal year 2024.\n- In the Business Access segment, the fiber-optic network is to be expanded further in 2024 with the connection of new locations. In addition, the business customer and wholesale business will continue to be developed.\n- In fiscal year 2024, the key topics in the Consumer Applications segment will again be the further expansion of data-driven business models and a focus on fee-based premium products.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n The Business Applications segment will continue to focus on expanding business with existing customers and gaining new high-quality customer relationships in 2023. In addition, the segment will expand its cloud business in particular.\n\nFollowing a successful start to the year, the Company's Management Board believes that (at the time of preparing this Management Report) the Company is on track to reach the forecast presented above in the section \"Forecast for the fiscal year 2024\".\n\n#### **Forward-looking statements**\n\nThis Management Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, and projections of the Management Board of United Internet AG and currently available information. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and are based upon expectations, assumptions, and projections that may not prove to be accurate. United Internet AG does not guarantee that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and does not accept any obligation, nor have the intention, to adjust or update the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 5. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) recommends disclosures on the internal control and risk management system. These go beyond the statutory requirements for the management report and are not included in the auditor's review of the content of the management report (\"nonmanagement report-related disclosures”). In chapter 5 “Internal control system and risk management system”, they are thematically assigned to the main elements of the internal control and risk management system and are separated from the disclosures to be audited by separate paragraphs and marked accordingly as “unaudited”.\n\n## **Internal control system (unaudited)**\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) of United Internet AG covers the entire organization and serves to maintain the functionality and efficiency of business processes, the reliability of operational information, the safeguarding of assets, and compliance with regulations. To this end, the controls carried out include adherence to planned processes, the \"four-eye principle\", and the separation of functions. The controls are defined on the basis of uniform categorizations for each process and are carried out both centrally in some cases and decentrally throughout the Group. Defined processes, which involve those responsible in the specialist areas as well as process experts, ensure that process and organizational risks are countered in a preventive manner. Together and in cooperation with Risk Management, all units of the Group assess if there are any organizational and process risks and whether these could have an impact on the ICS. The ICS is regularly enhanced, also with the involvement of experts. Monitoring is based on the three pillars of Risk Management, Corporate Audit and external auditors. Corporate Audit evaluates and improves governance processes and risk management and also assesses the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS by conducting regular spot checks.\n\n## **Accounting-related internal control system and risk management system**\n\nIn accordance with section 289 (4) and section 315 (4) German Commercial Code (HGB), United Internet AG is obliged to describe the main features of its accounting-related internal control system and risk management system in its Management Report.\n\nUnited Internet AG regards risk management as part of its internal control system (ICS). The ICS is understood as an ongoing process comprising organizational, controlling, and monitoring structures to ensure permanent compliance with legal and corporate requirements.\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG is responsible for the scope and structure of its ICS and takes account of the Company's specific requirements. The monitoring of the ICS's effectiveness is one of the duties of the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG, which is regularly informed by the Management Board about the status of the ICS and the findings of the Company's Internal Audit system. Within the United Internet Group, the Corporate Audit department is responsible for independently auditing the appropriateness, effectiveness, and functionality of the ICS and has been granted extensive rights with regard to information, examination, and access in order to exercise its duties. Its audits are based on a risk-oriented audit plan which also includes regular audits of subsidiaries. In addition, the Corporate Audit department conducts fundamental audits regarding the proper functioning of important asset and inventory stock-taking. In addition, those areas of ICS of relevance for financial reporting are audited with regard to efficiency by the external auditors as part of their risk-oriented audit approach.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting-related ICS is continuously being developed and comprises principles, procedures, and measures to secure the effectiveness, economic efficiency, and compliance of the accounting system and to ensure that the relevant laws and standards are observed. During preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the ICS is used in particular to ensure the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union, and the additional provisions under commercial law pursuant to section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). When preparing the Annual Financial Statements and Management Report, the ICS also helps ensure that regulations under commercial law are observed.\n\nHowever, a fundamental aspect of every ICS, irrespective of its particular design, is that it cannot provide absolute safety that material misstatements in accounting are avoided or detected. This may be due, e.g., to incorrect discretionary decisions of individuals, faulty controls, or criminal acts.\n\nThe following statements refer solely to the fully consolidated subsidiaries included in the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG, for which United Internet AG has the direct or indirect possibility of determining their financial and monetary policy in order to derive a benefit from the activity of these companies.\n\nThe task of United Internet AG's risk management system includes setting measures to detect and assess risks, reduce them to an acceptable level, and monitor recognized risks. A risk management system requires organized action to deal suitably with uncertainty and threats and urges employees to utilize the regulations and instruments required to ensure compliance with the risk management principles. In addition to operative risk management, it also includes the systematic early recognition, management, and monitoring of risks. The accounting-related risk management system focuses on the risk of false statements in accounting and external reporting.\n\nSpecific accounting-related risks may arise, for example, from the conclusion of unusual or complex transactions. Business transactions which cannot be processed in a routine manner are also exposed to latent risks. It is necessary to grant a limited circle of people certain scope for discretion in the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, which may result in further accounting-related risks.\n\nThe accounting-related ICS comprises internal controls, defined on the basis of risk aspects, for those processes which are relevant for financial reporting as well as those processes that support the IT systems. Special emphasis is placed on IT security, change management, and operational IT processes. Organizational, preventive, and detective controls are applied, which can be conducted manually or with the aid of IT. The effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting-related ICS requires highly developed employee skills. Regular training, the \"four-eye principle\", and the functional separation of administrative, executive, and approval processes are indispensable for the United Internet Group. The Corporate Accounting division and other accounting departments are responsible for the management of the accounting processes. Laws, accounting standards, and other pronouncements are continuously analyzed with regard to their relevance and impact on accounting. The Group's accounting policy sets out and communicates relevant requirements and forms the basis for the financial statement preparation process. In addition, supplementary procedural instructions such as the intercompany guideline, standardized reporting formats, IT systems and computer-aided reporting and consolidation processes support the standardized and compliant Group accounting process. The Corporate Accounting division ensures that these requirements are implemented uniformly throughout the Group. The Group companies are responsible for the orderly and timely execution of the accounting-related processes and systems and are supported by the accounting departments accordingly.\n\nIf significant control weaknesses or opportunities for improvement are detected, they are assessed and countermeasures are developed with the persons responsible to improve the effectiveness of the ICS.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImplementation of the measures is monitored by the Corporate Audit department and may be the subject of subsequent audits. In order to ensure the high quality of the accounting-related ICS, the Corporate Audit department is closely involved during all stages.\n\n## **Effectiveness statement (unaudited)**\n\nBased on its regular review of the internal control system and risk management system, the Management Board is not aware of any circumstances at the time of preparing this Combined Management Report that would speak against or call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY TAKEOVER LAW\n\nThe following disclosures according to sections 289a and 315a German Commercial Code (HGB) represent conditions as of the balance sheet date. As required by section 176 (1) sentence 1 German Stock Corporation Law (\"Aktiengesetz\" – AktG), the disclosures are explained in the sections below.\n\nWith regard to disclosures on the composition of subscribed capital, as well as direct and indirect participating interests in the capital, pursuant to section 289a sentence 1 no. 1 and no. 3 HGB and section 315a sentence 1 no. 1 and 3 HGB, please refer to Note 37 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the notes on equity in the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG as at December 31, 2023.\n\nFor further details, please refer to note 16, as well as 37 - 39, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n# Composition of capital\n\nUpon completion of the capital reduction resolved by the Management Board on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by means of canceling 2,000,000 treasury shares, subscribed capital was reduced to € 192,000,000 as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023 and is divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares. Each share entitles the owner to one vote. There are no other share categories. In the case of a capital increase, the commencement of dividend entitlement for new shares may be determined separately from the moment of contribution. All shares are listed on the stock exchange.\n\n# Limitations affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares\n\nThere are legal limitations affecting voting rights of certain shares pursuant to section 71b AktG and section 71d S. 4 in conjunction with section 71b AktG. Upon completion of the capital reduction resolved by the Management Board on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by means of canceling 2,000,000 treasury shares, and the buyback of 13,899,596 shares (without fractional amounts) as part of the public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG, United Internet held 19,183,705 treasury shares at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, corresponding to 9.99% of the current capital stock of 192 million shares.\n\nThere are also legal limitations affecting voting rights regarding a conflict of interests pursuant to section 136 (1) AktG for shares held by the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nUpon completion of the aforementioned capital reduction and buyback of 13,899,596 shares as part of the public share buyback offer (of which 5,044,795 shares were from Mr. Ralph Dommermuth), Mr. Dommermuth indirectly holds 93,955,205 shares of United Internet AG (48.94% of capital stock) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023. Of the other Management Board members, Mr. Huhn also held 500 shares of the Company (0.00% of capital stock) as of December 31, 2023.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the current members of the Supervisory Board, Mr. Rasch held 12,500 shares (0.01% of capital stock) and Prof. Dr. Söffing held 3,500 shares (0.00% of capital stock) in United Internet AG as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThere are no limitations affecting the transfer of shares.\n\n# Direct and indirect participations in capital with over 10% of voting rights\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company's CEO, Mr. Ralph Dommermuth, residing in Germany, indirectly held 93,955,205 shares or 48.94% of the 192,000,000 shares in United Internet AG. The Management Board is not aware of further participations in capital exceeding 10% of voting rights.\n\n# Special rights\n\nMr. Ralph Dommermuth is personally entitled to nominate two members of the Supervisory Board. This right is exercised by naming a person for the Supervisory Board to the Company's Management Board. The nomination becomes effective as soon as the nominated person declares his acceptance of the Supervisory Board seat to the Management Board. A requirement for the aforementioned nomination right is that Mr. Ralph Dommermuth holds shares himself or via affiliated companies pursuant to section 15f. AktG representing at least 25% of the Company's voting capital and can prove as much to the Management Board on nomination of the Supervisory Board member by providing depository account statements or similar documents. Mr. Dommermuth has so far not made use of this nomination right.\n\nThe Management Board is not aware of any further shares with special rights.\n\n# Appointment and dismissal of Management Board members, amendments to Company articles\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of Management Board members is determined by sections 84, 85 AktG in conjunction with section 1 of the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. According to section 6 (1) of the Company's articles, the Management Board consists of at least one person. The Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, determines their number and can appoint one member of the Management Board as Chairman.\n\nEach amendment of the Company's articles requires the adoption of a shareholders' meeting resolution with a majority of at least three quarters of capital represented at the vote. Pursuant to section 22 of the Company's articles in conjunction with section 179 (1) sentence 2 AktG (Changes in capital stock and number of shares), the Supervisory Board is authorized to make amendments to the Company's articles insofar as they only concern formulation.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Powers of the Management Board to issue new shares\n\nThe Management Board is entitled to issue new shares under the following circumstances:\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to increase, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until August 31, 2026 by a maximum of € 75,000,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par value shares in return for cash and/or non-cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2023). In the case of cash contributions, the new shares may – at the option of the Management Board – also be underwritten, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by one or several credit institutions and/or any other company fulfilling the requirements of section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG subject to the obligation to offer the shares only to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription rights).\n\nSubject to the following restrictions, the shareholders will be granted subscription rights.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, fractional shares from the shareholders' subscription rights and to also exclude subscription rights to the extent necessary in order to grant subscription rights for new shares to bearers of warrants and convertible bonds issued by United Internet AG or its subsidiaries in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligations.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a capital increase in return for cash contributions, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for an amount of up to 10% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted if the new shares are issued at an issuance price which is not substantially below the market price of those Company shares already listed at the time of the final determination of the issuance price, which is to be as near in time as possible to the share issue date. This maximum amount includes any shares that are issued or to be issued under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded; also, the amount must take into account any shares that are issued or sold during the term of this authorization pursuant to or in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights in the event of capital increases in return for non-cash contributions in order to grant shares for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in companies or other assets, including rights and receivables, or as part of business combinations.\n\nThe foregoing authorizations to exclude subscription rights are in aggregate limited to an amount of up to 20% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted. This maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to conversion and/or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds that are issued with warrant and/or conversion rights or conversion obligations during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to treasury shares sold or used during the term of this authorization in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized to determine, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the further details of the capital increase and its execution.\n\nCapital stock is conditionally increased by up to € 18,500,000.00, divided into up to 18,500,000 no-par value registered shares (Conditional Capital 2023). The conditional capital increase shall only be implemented to the extent that the bearers or holders of warrant rights or conversion rights or obligations from bonds with warrants or convertible bonds that have been issued or guaranteed by the Company or a subordinated Group company in the period ending August 31, 2026, on the basis of the Management Board's authorization resolved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023, exercise their warrant or conversion rights or, to the extent that they are obligated to convert their bonds, fulfill their obligation, or to the extent that the Company exercises a right to grant shares in the Company, instead of paying the cash amount due (or parts thereof), and to the extent that cash compensation is not granted or treasury shares or shares in another listed company are not used to service bonds.\n\nThe new shares shall be issued at the warrant or conversion price to be determined in accordance with the above authorizing resolution. The new shares shall participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created; to the extent that it is legally permissible, the Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, determine the profit participation of new shares and, notwithstanding section 60 (2) AktG, also for a fiscal year already expired.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details concerning the execution of the conditional capital increase.\n\n# Powers of the Management Board to buy and use treasury shares\n\nThe authorization to acquire and use treasury shares that was granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 20, 2020 in accordance with section 71 (1) number 8 AktG expired on August 31, 2023. Against this background, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 issued a new authorization pursuant to section 71 (1) number 8 AktG, to acquire and use treasury shares. This authorization is valid from September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2026.\n\nThe authorization is limited to an amount of 10% of the capital stock existing at the time the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopts the resolution or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the authorization is exercised. The authorization can be exercised directly by the Company, or by a dependent or majority-owned corporation of the Company, or by third parties commissioned by dependent or majority-owned corporations of the Company, and permits the purchase of treasury shared in their entirety or in parts on one or more occasions.\n\nTreasury shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer made to all shareholders or by means of a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers or by granting tender rights to shareholders.\n\n If acquisition is made via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer, the per share purchase price (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) paid by the Company must not be more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean of the closing auction prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the conclusion of any transaction imposing an obligation (if the acquisition is made via the stock exchange) or before the publication of the decision \n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nto submit a public purchase offer (if the acquisition is made by means of a public purchase offer). Should the share price deviate significantly from the offered purchase price or from the limits of the offered purchase price range after a public purchase offer is published, the offer may be adjusted. In this case, the relevant purchase price shall be determined based on the corresponding stock exchange price on the last trading day before the announcement of the adjustment and must not be more than 10% higher or lower than that amount.\n\nThe volume of a public purchase offer may be limited. If, in the case of a public purchase offer, the volume of the tendered shares exceeds the volume intended to be bought back, tender rights, if any, may be partially excluded so that shares may be acquired based on the proportions of tendered shares (percentages of tendered shares) rather than based on the proportions of the tendering shareholders' shareholdings in the Company (shareholding percentages). Tender rights, if any, may also be partially excluded such that priority is given to smaller lots of up to 100 shares offered per shareholder and such that the number of shares is rounded in accordance with commercial rounding principles in order to avoid fractions of shares.\n\n If acquisition is made by means of a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers, the Company will stipulate a purchase price range per share within which sales offers may be submitted. The purchase price range may be adjusted if, during the submission period, the share price deviates significantly from the share price prevailing at the time of publication of the request to submit sales offers. The purchase price per share (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) to be paid by the Company and that the Company calculates on the basis of the received sales offers must not be more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean of the closing auction prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the cutoff date described below. The cutoff date is the date on which the Company's Management Board makes its final and formal decision on the publication of the request to submit sales offers or the adjustment thereof.\n\nThe volume of offers that may be accepted may be limited. If, due to the limited volume, not all of several equal sales offers can be accepted, tender rights, if any, may be partially excluded so that shares may be acquired based on the percentages of tendered shares rather than based on the shareholding percentages. Tender rights, if any, may also be partially excluded such that priority is given to smaller lots of up to 100 shares tendered per shareholder and such that the number of shares is rounded in accordance with commercial rounding principles in order to avoid fractions of shares.\n\n If acquisition is made by granting tender rights to the shareholders, the rights may be allocated per Company share. A number of tender rights determined based on the ratio of the Company's capital stock to the volume of shares to be bought back by the Company will entitle a tendering shareholder to sell one Company share to the Company. Tender rights may also be allocated in such a way that one tender right is allocated for a certain number of shares determined based on the ratio of the capital stock to the buyback volume. Fractions of tender rights will not be allocated; in case thereof, partial tender rights are excluded. The price or the limits of the offered purchase price range (in each case excluding ancillary acquisition costs) at which a share may be sold to the Company when a tender right is exercised will be determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-section bb) above, with the relevant cutoff date being the date of publication of the buyback offer with the granting of tender rights, and adjusted if necessary also in accordance with the provisions of the sub-section above, with the relevant cutoff date being the date of publication of the adjustment. The Company's Management Board will determine the further details of the tender rights, in particular their conditions, term and, where appropriate, tradability.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to grant, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, in the event treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders subscription rights for shares to the bearers of bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or any subordinated Group company in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligations.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to sell, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders if the shares are sold for cash at a price that is not substantially below the stock exchange price of the Company's shares at the time of sale. The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded in this context. However, this authorization is subject to the condition that the shares sold with subscription rights excluded pursuant to section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG must not exceed in aggregate 10% of the capital stock either at the time the authorization becomes effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the authorization is exercised. This limit of 10% of the capital stock includes those shares that are issued during the term of this authorization until the sale of treasury shares from authorized capital with subscription rights excluded pursuant to section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG. This limit of 10% of the capital stock also includes those shares that are issued or are to be issued in order to service warrant and/or conversion rights and/or conversion obligations provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded.\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized to use, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares for the following purposes, in addition to a sale via the stock exchange or a use in another manner that complies with the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders:\n\n- As (partial) consideration in connection with the acquisition of companies or interests in companies or parts of companies or in connection with business combinations.\n- To float shares of the Company on foreign stock exchanges on which they were previously not admitted to trading. The price at which these shares are floated on foreign stock exchanges (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) must not be more than 5% below the arithmetic mean of the prices of the Company's no-par value shares in the closing auctions of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Xetra trading system (or an equivalent successor system) over the last five stock exchange trading days before the day of their flotation on the foreign stock exchange.\n- To grant shares of the Company to current and former members of the Management Board and employees of the Company as well as to current and former members of the management boards or, as the case may be, boards of directors and employees of affiliates of the Company within the meaning of sections 15 et seqq. AktG in fulfillment of claims under virtual share participation programs. To the extent members of the Company's Management Board are to be granted shares, the Company's Supervisory Board decides thereon.\n\nShareholders' statutory subscription rights with regard to these treasury shares will be excluded in accordance with sections 71 (1) no. 8 and 186 (3) and (4) AktG to the extent that these shares are used pursuant to the above authorizations. Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for fractional shares if treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe authorizations to exclude subscription rights are in aggregate limited to an amount of up 10% of the capital stock existing at the time these authorizations become effective or \">– if this amount is lower \">– at the time the resolution to sell treasury shares is adopted. This maximum amount of 10% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nconversion and/ or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds issued during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of the capital stock attributable to shares issued from authorized capital during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board is authorized to redeem, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, treasury shares without any further resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting being required either for the redemption or the implementation thereof. The redemption may also be implemented in accordance with section 237 (3) no. 3 AktG without a capital reduction and in such a manner that, as a result of the redemption, the proportionate share of the Company's remaining no-par value shares in the capital stock is increased in accordance with section 8 (3) AktG. In accordance with section 237 (3) no. 3, 2nd half-sentence AktG, the Management Board is authorized to amend the number of shares specified in the Articles of Association accordingly. The redemption may also be implemented in combination with a capital reduction, in which case the Management Board is authorized to reduce the capital stock by the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to the redeemed shares. The Supervisory Board is authorized to amend the number of shares and the capital stock amount specified in the Articles of Association.\n\nThe foregoing authorizations are granted for the period beginning September 1, 2023. They may be exercised once or several times, in their entirety or partially, individually or collectively. They also cover the use of treasury shares that have been acquired on the basis of previous authorizations to acquire treasury shares and treasury shares that have been acquired in accordance with section 71d sentence 5 AktG or (i) by any company controlled or majority-owned by the Company or (ii) by third parties acting for the account of the Company or of any company controlled or majority-owned by the Company.\n\n# Material agreements conditional to a change of control following a takeover bid\n\nA bank consortium has granted United Internet AG a syndicated loan facility of € 810 million until January 2025. In fiscal 2020, the Company exercised a contractually agreed extension option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated credit facility entered into on December 21, 2018 for the period January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690 million was agreed for this extension period. € 150 million of the revolving syndicated credit facility had been drawn as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n The members of the consortium were granted the right to terminate their share of the syndicated loan facility or the syndicated loan if a third party or a group of third parties acting in concert acquired a majority of the shares in United Internet AG or held the majority of voting shares at an Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company. The right of termination is available to each member of the bank consortium individually within 30 days of the announcement of the change of control by the Company. However, this right of termination does not apply if the majority of shares or voting rights at an Annual Shareholders' Meeting are acquired by Mr. Ralph Dommermuth or his direct relatives.\n\nFurthermore, several promissory note loans of United Internet AG totaling € 1,162.0 million are outstanding at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n The lenders of the promissory notes were granted the right to terminate their share of the respective promissory note loans if a third party or a group of third parties acting in concert acquired a majority interest in United Internet AG. The right of termination is available to each lender \n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nindividually within 30 days of the announcement of the change of control by the Company. However, this right of termination does not apply if the majority of the shares are acquired by Mr. Ralph Dommermuth.\n\n# Compensation agreements in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid\n\nNo compensation agreements have been concluded with members of the Management Board or employees of the Company in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7. DECLARATION ON COMPANY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe disclosures made in chapter \"7. Declaration on Company Management\" are \"non-audited management report disclosures\" as an audit of the disclosures contained in the Declaration on Company Management in accordance with section 317 (2) sentence 6 German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\" – HGB) is limited to the fact that the information has been provided and the Corporate Governance Report in chapter 7 constitutes a \"non-management report-related disclosure\" which is not subject to a substantive audit.\n\n## Principles of corporate governance\n\nAs a German public company listed on the stock exchange, the management of United Internet AG is governed by the relevant statutory regulations and the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\").\n\nThe term Corporate Governance stands for responsible corporate management and control geared to sustainable value creation. Efficient cooperation between Management Board and Supervisory Board, respect for stockholder interests, openness and transparency of corporate communications are key aspects of good corporate governance.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG regard it as their duty to secure the Company's continued existence and sustainable value creation through responsible corporate governance focused on the long term. Appropriate consideration is given to environmental and social objectives.\n\nIn this declaration on company management, the Management Board and Supervisory Board report on the Company's corporate governance (Corporate Governance Report) in addition to the statutory requirements in accordance with section 289f HGB for the parent company and section 315d HGB for the Group also in accordance with Principle 23 of the Code. The Corporate Governance Report is based on the Code in its current version dated April 18, 2022, which was published in the Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022\n\n# Management and corporate structure\n\nIn accordance with its legal status, United Internet AG operates a dual management and monitoring structure comprising two corporate bodies: the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The third body is the Shareholders' Meeting. All three bodies are committed to serving the Company's interests.\n\n# Management Board\n\n## **Working procedures of the Management Board**\n\nThe Management Board is the body charged with managing the Group's operations. In the fiscal year 2023, it initially consisted of two persons (namely Mr. Ralph Dommermuth and Mr. Martin Mildner), and following the departure of Mr. Mildner on expiry of March 31, 2023, and the appointment of Mr. Ralf Hartings and Mr. Markus Huhn, each as of April 1, 2023, it consisted of three persons. For initial appointments, a term of office of three years is considered. The Supervisory Board assesses on a case\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nby-case basis as to which term of office within the legally permissible term of appointment appears appropriate. Beyond this, Management Board members are appointed for no longer than five years. The Management Board conducts operations in accordance with its legal and statutory obligations, as well as the rules of procedure adopted by the Supervisory Board, and the corresponding recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG.\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for preparing the Interim and Annual Financial Statements as well as for appointing key managers within the Company. In addition, it systematically defines the risks and opportunities for the Company associated with social and environmental factors, as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities, and subsequently assesses these. In addition to long-term economic objectives, the corporate strategy also takes appropriate account of environmental and social objectives. Corporate planning includes both the corresponding financial and sustainability-related targets. Further information on sustainability can be found on the Company's website at www.united-internet.de under Company/Sustainability.\n\nDecisions of fundamental importance require the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board in accordance with the statutory provisions of section 90 AktG and provides the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at least once a month with an oral overview – and at the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also in writing – of the current status of relevant reporting items pursuant to section 90a AktG. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is thus informed without delay by the Chairman or Speaker of the Management Board, or the Chief Financial Officer, about important events that are essential for assessing the Company's situation and development, as well as for the management of the Company. Important items also include any substantial deviation from the budget or other forecasts of the Company. The Chairman or Speaker of the Management Board, or Chief Financial Officer, shall also inform the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in advance where possible otherwise immediately thereafter, about all ad hoc announcements of the Company pursuant to Art. 17 MAR.\n\nThere is an age limit of 70 for members of the Management Board. This requirement is currently complied with in full.\n\nThe Management Board conducts the Company's business with joint responsibility and according to common objectives, plans, and policies. Irrespective of the joint responsibility of the Management Board, each member bears responsibility for his assigned division, but is required to subordinate the interests of his assigned division to the overall good of the Company.\n\nThe full Executive Board regulates the division of responsibilities in a business distribution plan.\n\nThe Management Board members inform each other about important events within their divisions. Matters of greater importance which are not approved in the budget must be discussed and decided by at least two Management Board members, whereby one of the two Management Board members must be responsible for the Finance division.\n\nIrrespective of their areas of responsibility, all Management Board members constantly monitor those events and data which are crucial for the Company's business development so they are always able to help avert potential disadvantages, or implement desirable improvements and expedient changes by drawing them to the attention of the full Management Board.\n\nThe full Management Board resolves on all matters of particular importance and scope for the Company or its subsidiaries and investment companies.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nResolutions are adopted by the full Management Board with a simple majority. Should the vote result in a tie, the Chairman of the Management Board has a casting vote. The resolutions of the Management Board are recorded in the minutes.\n\nThe full Management Board meets regularly once a month and otherwise as required.\n\nEach Management Board member immediately discloses any conflict of interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Management Board or Speaker of the Management Board and informs the other Management Board members about it where necessary.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the members of the Management Board did not and do not currently hold any supervisory board mandates in other listed companies outside the Group or comparable functions and thus also do not chair the supervisory boards of such companies.\n\n## **Composition of the Management Board**\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Management Board members on December 31, 2023**\n\n- Ralph Dommermuth, Company founder and Chief Executive Officer (with the Company since 1988)\n- Ralf Hartings, Chief Financial Officer (Management Board member since April 1, 2023; with the United Internet Group since 2021)\n- Markus Huhn, Management Board member responsible for Shared Services / HR (Management Board member since April 1, 2023; with the United Internet Group since 1994)\n\n#### **Departed in the fiscal year 2023**\n\n Martin Mildner, Chief Financial Officer (Management Board member from October 1, 2020 to March 31, 2023)\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\n## **Working procedures of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting consisted of five members until May 16, 2023. Since May 17, 2023, the Supervisory Board has once again comprised six members (namely, Mr. Philipp von Bismarck, Dr. Manuel Cubero del Castillo-Olivares, Mr. Stefan Rasch, Prof. Dr. Andreas Söffing, and Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei-Yee Weiß, as well as – since May 2023 – Prof. Dr. Franca Ruhwedel). The members of the Supervisory Board are generally elected for a period of five years.\n\nIn accordance with German law, the Company's articles, its rules of procedure, and the corresponding recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG – the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the Management Board and monitors and advises it with\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nregard to the management of business, and the Company's risk and opportunity management system. This mainly comprises questions relating to the topic of sustainability.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at regular intervals to discuss with the Management Board all matters of relevance to the Company regarding strategy and its implementation, as well as planning, the development of business, the risk position, risk management, and compliance. Together with the Management Board, it discusses the quarterly statements and half-year reports before publication and approves the annual budgets. These includes detailed sales, cost and earnings budgets as well as liquidity and annual investment budgets. The Supervisory Board examines the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company and the Group and adopts them if it has no reservations. In doing so, it also takes the reports of the Company's external auditors into account.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's responsibilities also include appointing members of the Management Board, as well as determining and regularly monitoring their remuneration in compliance with the latest legal regulations and recommendations of the Code – unless deviations are declared pursuant to section 161 AktG.\n\nWhen appointing members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board strives to achieve the best possible, diverse and mutually complementary composition for the Company and pays attention to longterm succession planning. Experience and industry knowledge as well as professional and personal qualifications play a particularly important role.\n\nAs part of its long-term succession planning, the Supervisory Board, with the involvement of the Management Board, regularly discusses highly skilled executives who could be considered as potential candidates for Management Board positions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board conducts regular tests to assess the efficiency of the Supervisory Board as a whole, as well as the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee. In accordance with Recommendation D.12 of the Code, the Supervisory Board and its committee assess how effectively they each perform their duties as a body. For this purpose, a self-assessment by means of questionnaires is conducted every two years or so.\n\nAt its meeting on December 11, 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee of United Internet AG conducted a self-assessment for the fiscal year 2023 in the presence of all committee members and the Audit Committee Chairman. The self-assessment was carried out on the basis of a comprehensive catalog of questions, which included in particular an assessment of the working methods and activities, as well as the size and structure of the Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, an assessment was made of the work with the auditor and interaction with the Management Board and the Group's departments.\n\nThe last self-assessment of the Supervisory Board was conducted and evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2022. The self-assessment was carried out on the basis of a comprehensive catalog of questions, focusing in particular on expectations, time commitment, composition of the Supervisory Board, independence of the Supervisory Board and how it deals with conflicts of interest, Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, and accounting matters.\n\nThe results of the self-assessments confirm that there is a good and open exchange within the bodies, as well as a trusting and cooperative working relationship with the auditor, the Management Board and the Company's departments. This professional cooperation is reflected, for example, in the receipt of well-prepared documents/information, which are always provided appropriately and on time. Specific suggestions are addressed and implemented during the year as part of the work of the Supervisory Board and Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing a thorough evaluation, it can therefore be assumed that the activities of the Supervisory Board and its Audit and Risk Committee are performed efficiently.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board complete the training and further education measures required for their tasks on their own, but receive appropriate support in this context from the Company. The measures conducted are detailed in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is convened at least twice every half of a calendar year. Supervisory Board meetings are convened in writing by its Chairman at least 14 days in advance. Further and more detailed information on the exact number of meetings and the topics discussed at these meetings can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Company.\n\nWhen Supervisory Board meetings are convened, the Supervisory Board members are informed of the agenda items. If an agenda item has not been properly announced, a resolution concerning it may only be adopted if no Supervisory Board member objects prior to the vote.\n\nResolutions of the Supervisory Board are generally adopted at meetings held with physical attendance. However, it is permissible for meetings of the Supervisory Board to be held in the form of a video or telephone conference call or for individual members of the Supervisory Board to be connected by video or telephone call and, in such cases, for resolutions to be adopted or votes to be cast by video or telephone conference call. Meetings are chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. If so arranged by the Chairman, resolutions may also be adopted outside of meetings by other means, for example by phone or e-mail, if no member objects to this procedure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has a quorum if all members have been officially invited and at least three members participate in the resolution. A member shall also be deemed to participate in a resolution if he abstains from voting.\n\nUnless the law prescribes otherwise, resolutions of the Supervisory Board are adopted with a simple majority.\n\nMinutes are kept of the Supervisory Board's discussions and resolutions.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board is authorized to submit on behalf of the Supervisory Board the declarations of intent required for the implementation of the Supervisory Board's resolutions.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee assists the Supervisory Board in its monitoring of accounting practices and the integrity of the accounting process, as well as in monitoring the effectiveness and functionality of the internal control system, the risk management system, the compliance management system, and the internal auditing system. Moreover, it supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the auditing of the financial statements, the services provided by the auditor, the auditing fees, and the additional services provided by the auditor.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee closely examines the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, the Combined Management Report for the Company and the Group, the nonfinancial statement and the non-financial Group statement, and the Management Board's proposal for the allocation of unappropriated profit. It discusses with the Management Board and the auditors the audit reports, the audit process, the audit focus areas and methodology, as well as the audit results, also with regard to the internal control system relating to the accounting process, and makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board. It regularly assesses the quality of the audit. Prior to their publication, it discusses the quarterly statements and the half-year financial report with the Management Board.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee prepares the negotiations and resolutions of the Supervisory Board for the election proposal of the auditor to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and decisions on corporate governance issues, as well as resolving on the approval of related party transactions in accordance with section 111b (1) AktG. There were no such transactions requiring approval in the reporting period.\n\nThe Audit Committee discusses with the auditor the assessment of the audit risk, the audit strategy and audit planning, and the audit results. The Chairman or Chairwoman of the Audit Committee regularly discusses current issues relating to the audit and its progress with the auditor, also in the presence of all members of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Audit Committee also consults regularly with the auditor without the presence of the Management Board. A total of eight consultation meetings were held with the auditor in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman or Chairwoman of the Audit Committee regularly reports to the Supervisory Board on the activities of the Audit and Risk Committee. In the event of significant occurrences and findings by the Audit and Risk Committee, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is immediately informed.\n\n## **Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board / status of implementation**\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board aims to achieve a composition of the Supervisory Board that enables qualified advice and supervision for the Company's Management Board.\n\nIn view of\n\n- the size of the Supervisory Board,\n- the business in which the Company operates,\n- the size and structure of the Company,\n- the scope of the Company's international activities, and\n- its current shareholder structure,\n\nthe Company's Supervisory Board has adopted the following targets for its future composition. These take into account the statutory requirements both with regard to the requirements placed on individual Supervisory Board members and with regard to the composition of the entire Supervisory Board and – unless expressly stated otherwise – the recommendations of the Code. In particular, a skills profile has been prepared with regard to the overall body.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will take these targets into account when making proposals to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting regarding the election of Supervisory Board members and ensure that the respective candidates meet the requirements for fulfilling the skills profile for the overall body. In doing so, the specific situation of the Company must be taken into consideration.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Requirements for individual members**\n\nThe Company's Supervisory Board aims to ensure that each Supervisory Board member meets the following requirements:\n\n#### **General requirement profile**\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board should have the requisite knowledge and experience to enable them to carefully monitor and advise the Company's Management Board and to assess any risks for the Company's business. Moreover, the Supervisory Board will ensure that all its members have a personal profile that enables them to maintain the Company's public reputation.\n\n#### **Time availability**\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board must have sufficient time to exercise their duties with due care throughout the entire period of office. In particular, the members of the Supervisory Board must observe the legal requirements and should follow the Code's recommendations regarding the permissible number of Supervisory Board mandates.\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nSupervisory Board members should not engage in any other activities likely to cause frequent conflicts of interest. These include board positions or consultancy work for key competitors, as well as personal relationships with them.\n\n#### **Age limit for Supervisory Board members**\n\nAs a rule, members of the Supervisory Board should not have reached the age of 70 at the time of their election or re-election.\n\n## **Requirements regarding the composition of the Supervisory Board as a whole**\n\nIn addition to the individual requirements for Supervisory Board members, the Company's Supervisory Board also strives to reach the following targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board as a whole in line with recommendation C.1 of the Code.\n\n#### **Skills profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole**\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must collectively have the knowledge, skills, and professional experience necessary for them to carry out their tasks as required. The Supervisory Board strives to ensure that the Supervisory Board as a whole covers the widest possible range of knowledge and experience relevant to the Company, and in particular meets the following requirements:\n\n- In-depth knowledge and experience of the telecommunications and internet sector;\n- Expertise or experience from other sectors of the economy;\n- Entrepreneurial or operational experience;\n- At least one member with several years of experience working abroad or working for a company with international activities;\n- At least one member with special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control processes;\n- Expertise in sustainability issues of significance for the Company;\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n- At least one member with expertise in the field of accounting, whereby the expertise in the field of accounting must consist of special knowledge and experience in the use of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems and must also apply to sustainability reporting;\n- At least one additional member with expertise in the field of auditing, whereby the expertise in the field of auditing must consist of special knowledge and experience in the field of auditing and must also apply to the auditing of sustainability reporting;\n- Knowledge and experience of strategy development and implementation;\n- In-depth knowledge and experience of controlling and risk management;\n- Knowledge and experience of HR planning and management;\n- In-depth knowledge and experience in the field of governance and compliance;\n- Expertise in the needs of capital market-oriented companies.\n\n#### **Diversity**\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the Supervisory Board is composed of a wide variety of members so that the Supervisory Board as a whole has sufficient diversity of opinion and knowledge. In its nominations, the Supervisory Board will take into account the diversity concept established by the Company, which is presented in a separate section below.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims to ensure that – what it believes to be – an appropriate number of at least four of its six members are also independent within the meaning of the criteria set out in the recommendations of the Code.\n\nThe Supervisory Board once again addressed the above objectives for its composition during the reporting year. In particular, it discussed them with regard to the skills profile for the full Supervisory Board. It also adhered to them and further expanded them. The Supervisory Board strives to fulfill the skills profile it developed for the Supervisory Board as a whole.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Composition of the Supervisory Board/implementation status**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of United Internet AG comprised the following members in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n#### **Supervisory Board members as at December 31,

In doing so, the specific situation of the Company is to be taken into consideration.\n\nSubject to the formation of short fiscal years, the current term of office of the Supervisory Board members ends on expiry of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the year 2025.\n\n# Targets for the share of women on the Supervisory Board, Management Board, and in management positions / implementation status\n\nAs a listed company, United Internet AG is subject to the following obligations in particular of the German Stock Corporation Law (AktG):\n\n- Setting of targets by the Supervisory Board for the share of women on the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG (section 111 (5) AktG).\n- Setting of targets by the Supervisory Board for the share of women on the Management Board of United Internet AG (section 111 (5) AktG).\n- Setting of targets by the Management Board for the share of women on the first and second management levels below the Management Board of United Internet AG (section 76 (4) AktG).\n\nThe following targets are to be set for a period of no more than five years.\n\nAfter careful examination, the Supervisory Board and Management Board of United Internet AG adopted the following:\n\n- The Supervisory Board set the deadline for the attainment of the current targets for the share of women on the Supervisory Board and Management Board as the expiry of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2025 that decides on the discharge of the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2024.\n- After a target of \"0\" had previously been set for the Supervisory Board, a target of 30% was set for the share of women. The Supervisory Board currently comprises two women and four men.\n- A target of \"0\" was set for the Management Board. The Management Board was composed exclusively of two (at times three) men in the fiscal year 2023. After extensive and careful consideration, the Supervisory Board decided, based on the Company's interest in a steady continuation of the successful work of the Management Board's experienced members who are already familiar with the Group's structures, to set an unchanged target for the Management Board (now comprising three members) of “0”. At the same time, it was decided that in the event of a further increase in the size of the Management Board, the target for the proportion of women would be set at 25%.\n- Irrespective of this, the selection shall always be made according to the individual skills profile of the potential board members, whereby the Supervisory Board shall endeavor to give preference to women in the case of equal qualifications.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n- No target has been set for the share of women on the first and second management levels below the Management Board, as United Internet AG does not have any management levels below the Management Board due to its holding structure.\n- With regard to the share of women on the Supervisory Board and Management Board, the Supervisory Board reserves the right to resolve again on the target should there be any indication of a new appointment.\n\nThe current targets for the Supervisory Board and Management Board are therefore met at present.\n\n# Diversity concept\n\nDiversity aspects are always taken into account in the composition of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Company considers diversity to be not only desirable, but also crucial to the success of the Company. The Company therefore pursues an appreciative corporate culture in which individual diversity in terms of culture, nationality, gender, age group, educational or professional background, and religion is desired and equal opportunities – irrespective of age, disability, ethnic and cultural origin, gender, religion and ideology, or sexual identity – are promoted.\n\nThe Company aims to ensure that the Management Board and Supervisory Board are composed of many different types of people and that the bodies as a whole have a sufficiently wide variety of opinions and knowledge.\n\nIn particular, the following criteria should be taken into account:\n\n- The members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board should complement each other within their respective committees with regard to their experience, education, and professional background in order to develop a good understanding of the current status and the longer term opportunities and risks associated with the Company's business activities.\n- With regard to the gender quota, the Management Board and Supervisory Board have each set a target figure for the reference period until the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2025, which will decide on the discharge of the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2024. The Supervisory Board currently consists of two women and four men and the Management Board comprises three men. In principle, both genders should be treated equally according to their qualifications.\n- With the exception of the age limit of 70, as stipulated in B.5 and C.2 of the Code, no differentiation is made according to age for the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, and the sole differentiation should be according to the required knowledge and experience.\n- In view of the current size of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, consisting of just three and six members respectively, no targets have been set with regard to geographical origin. In order to ensure international experience, the Supervisory Board already stipulates that at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have several years of experience abroad or have gained operational experience with an internationally active company.\n\nIndividual strengths – in other words, everything that makes individual employees unique and distinctive within the Company – made it possible for the Company to become what it is today. A workforce comprising a wide variety of personalities offers the best possible conditions for creativity and productivity - and thus also for employee satisfaction. The resulting potential for ideas and innovation strengthens the Company's competitiveness and increases its opportunities in future markets. With this \n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nin mind, the aim is not only to find the field of activity and the function for each employee in which their individual potential and talents are best utilized, but also to ensure diversity in the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board – in the Company’s own interests – with regard to age, gender, and professional experience, for example.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has determined that the entirety of the relevant statutory and self-imposed provisions for its composition (targets for composition, skills profile, statutory target for the proportion of women, age limit, and the other provisions outlined above) should be regarded as a diversity concept within the meaning of section 289f (2) no. 6 HGB. The Company does not consider diversity targets that go beyond this with additional or more specific criteria to be appropriate. In view of the current size of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, more or more specific diversity aspects would create considerable difficulties to fill the positions taking into account all diversity criteria.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board believe that the diversity concept for the Management Board and Supervisory Board is currently fulfilled.\n\n# Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting is the body which formulates and expresses the interests of the shareholders of United Internet AG. At the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company and Consolidated Financial Statements are presented to the shareholders. The shareholders decide on the allocation of the unappropriated profit and vote on resolutions concerning other statutory topics, such as releasing the Management Board members from their responsibility for the past fiscal year and appointing external auditors. Each share entitles the owner to one vote. All shareholders who register in time and are listed in the Share Register on the day of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting are entitled to attend. Shareholders may also exercise their rights at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting by means of a proxy vote. The Company provides a proxy who votes according to the shareholder's instructions, providing he receives the required order.\n\n# Governance functions\n\nAt United Internet AG, governance functions are part of an integrated \"GRC\" organization which comprises the Corporate Governance, Corporate Risk Management & Internal Control Systems, and Corporate Compliance functions. The Group General Counsel, who reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of United Internet AG, is responsible for all GRC functions.\n\n# Internal Control System and Risk Management System\n\nTo secure the long-term corporate success of the United Internet Group, it is essential to effectively identify and analyze the risks involved in all business activities across the Group and to eliminate or limit them by means of suitable control measures. The Internal Control Management System and Risk Management System ensure that risks are handled responsibly. In particular, they are designed to identify, assess, manage, and monitor risks throughout the Group at an early stage. The systems are continuously refined and adapted to changing circumstances. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed by the Management Board about existing risks and how they are being dealt with, as well as about the effectiveness of the internal controls. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the Internal Control System and the Risk Management System were assessed by the Supervisory Board in its entirety. \n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main features of the Internal Control System and the Risk Management System with regard to the accounting process of the Company and the Group are described in detail in the Combined Management Report for the Company and the Group in accordance with sections 289 (4) and 315 (4) HGB. The Management Board also reports there in detail on existing risks and their development.\n\n# Compliance\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG has established a Group-wide risk-oriented Compliance Management System (UI-CMS) to ensure adherence to the legal and internal regulations. At the heart of this UI-CMS is a segment-based, decentralized Compliance Organization comprising segment compliance managers and corporate compliance managers.\n\nAt segment level, the segment compliance managers are responsible for the specific design of the a segment-based CMS. In certain business units, especially in significant subsidiaries of IONOS SE, the compliance organization is supported by local compliance managers and in certain departments, such as HR, by functional compliance managers.\n\nThe overarching objective of all compliance activities is to prevent compliance violations. This objective is achieved by taking appropriate measures in line with the United Internet Group's risk situation and in accordance with the three-level approach of \"Prevent\", \"Detect\", and \"Respond\". The main topics are the prevention of corruption, policy management, the establishment of confidential reporting channels and the protection of whistleblowers.\n\nThe main elements of the UI-CMS are described in detail in United Internet AG's Sustainability Report.\n\n# Financial disclosures / transparency\n\nIt is the declared aim of United Internet AG to inform institutional investors, private shareholders, financial analysts, employees, and the public simultaneously and with equal treatment about the Company's situation by means of regular, open, and up-to-date communication.\n\nTo this end, all important information, such as press releases, ad-hoc announcements, and other mandatory disclosures (e.g., directors' dealings and notifications of voting rights), as well as all financial reports, are published in accordance with statutory regulations. In addition, United Internet AG provides extensive information on its corporate website (www.united-internet.de), where documents and information on Annual Shareholders' Meetings and other economically relevant facts can be found.\n\nUnited Internet AG provides shareholders, analysts, and the press with four reports each fiscal year on the Company's business development and its financial and earnings position. The publication dates of these reports are stated in a binding financial calendar, which the Company posts on its website and regularly updates in accordance with legal obligations.\n\nThe Management Board also provides immediate information in the form of ad-hoc announcements about any events not known to the public which might significantly affect the share price.\n\nAs part of its investor relations activities, the Company's management team regularly meets with analysts and institutional investors. We also hold analyst conferences to announce our semi-annual and annual figures, which investors and analysts can also participate in via telephone.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Accounting and auditing\n\nThe United Internet Group's accounts are drawn up according to the principles of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS, as applicable in the EU) with consideration of section 315e HGB. However, the Annual Financial Statements of the parent company United Internet AG – relevant for all dividend and tax matters – are drawn up according to the rules of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Annual Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements are audited by independent auditors. The respective auditing company is selected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board issues the auditing mandate, determines auditing focal points, approves the auditing fee, and examines the independence of the auditors.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has audited the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG and the Group since the fiscal year 2022. Mr. Erik Hönig and Mr. Christian David Simon are the auditing partners responsible for the fiscal year 2023.\n\n# Remuneration of Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nRemuneration for members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board is presented in a detailed Remuneration Report for the fiscal year 2023 in accordance with section 162 AktG, together with the corresponding Auditor's Report, and is accessible to the public on the Company's website at www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html. The Annex to this Remuneration Report contains a detailed description of the current remuneration system in accordance with section 87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG as well as the most recent remuneration resolution adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with section 113 (3) AktG.\n\nInformation on Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration can also be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2023 under Note 42.\n\n# Declaration of conformity with regard to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG submitted their declaration of conformity (presented below) in accordance with section 161 AktG and immediately published it on the Company's website (www.united-internet.de), as well as in the Federal Gazette (\"Bundesanzeiger\").\n\nIn accordance with section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet AG declare that:\n\nUnited Internet AG has complied with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (\"Code\") as last revised on April 28, 2022, which became effective upon publication in the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022 and on which its last Declaration of Conformity issued on December 16, 2022\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nas well as the update of May 17, 2023 were based, with the stated exceptions detailed therein, and will continue to comply with the recommendations of the Code with the following exceptions:\n\n#### **Formation of a nomination committee (Recommendation D.5)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board does not form any other committees in addition to the Audit and Risk Committee, but performs all other tasks as a whole. The Supervisory Board considers this to be appropriate, as efficient plenary discussions and an intensive exchange of opinions are possible even with a six-member Supervisory Board. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board sees no need to establish a Nomination Committee.\n\n#### **Management Board remuneration - Remuneration system (Recommendations G.1 to G.5 inclusive of the Code)**\n\nTaking into account the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders' Rights Directive (\"ARUG II\") and the new German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\"), the Supervisory Board developed and agreed changes to the remuneration system for members of the Management Board.\n\nWith the recommendation to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in May 2021, the remuneration system became the basis for service agreements with Management Board members concluded in the future. The elaborated remuneration system takes into account the recommendations in G.1 to G.5 inclusive without any restrictions. The deviation from the recommendations in G1 to G5 inclusive is due exclusively to a service agreement still in effect at this time, but which has since been terminated.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Long-term variable remuneration (Recommendation G.10 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.10 of the Code, the variable remuneration components granted to members of the Management Board should be awarded primarily in the form of Company stock or on the basis thereof. Moreover, any such grants to members of the Management Board should be subject to a blackout period of four years. Share-based remuneration is awarded in the form of the Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) plan as a long-term remuneration program for the Management Board. The term of this plan totals six years. Within this period of six years, a Management Board member can exercise a portion (25%) of the SARs awarded at certain points in time — at the earliest, however, after two years. This means that a Management Board member can already obtain a part of the long-term variable remuneration after a period of two years. The total amount of SARs can only be fully exercised for the first time after a period of five years.\n\nOn May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting amended the previously valid remuneration system for members of the Company's Management Board. Accordingly, periods spent as a Management Board member of an affiliated company may be taken into account in full or in part when calculating the time limits.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is of the opinion that this system of long-term remuneration has proven its value and sees no reason to postpone any further the possibility of obtaining remuneration earned under the plan. The Supervisory Board believes that by linking the plan to the share price of United Internet AG and the Company's possibility to issue shares to satisfy entitlements from the plan, Management Board members already participate appropriately in the risks and opportunities of United Internet AG. Since the plan has been designed with a term of six years and the SARs awarded can only be exercised proportionately over this term and at the earliest after two years, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the plan is ideally suited to achieving the desired retention and incentive effect in the interest of United Internet AG and that no changes are required. The fact that service periods as a Management Board member of affiliated companies can now also be taken into account is intended to enable the promotion of Management Board members within the Group.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Retaining/reclaiming variable remuneration (Recommendation G.11 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.11 of the Code, the Supervisory Board shall have the possibility to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration in justified cases. A service agreement that already existed at the time the remuneration system was first approved but has since been terminated did not contain such a provision. This therefore constitutes a deviation from section G.11 of the Code. An obligation to agree a so-called claw-back clause for the reclaim of variable compensation has been included in the new remuneration system and was taken into account in the current service agreements of the Management Board members.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Remuneration system (Recommendations G.8, 9 and 12 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.8, 9 and 12 of the Code, agreed targets and target attainment, as well as regulations on maturity and holding periods, should not be changed retrospectively. In the context of the departure of a Management Board member, the Company deviated from this recommendation and is thus declaring this deviation.\n\n## **Management Board remuneration – Benefits on contract termination (Recommendation G.13 of the Code)**\n\nAccording to G.13 of the Code, any payments made to Management Board members due to early termination of their Management Board activity shall not exceed twice the annual remuneration and shall not constitute remuneration for more than the remaining term of the employment contract. If post-contractual non-compete clauses apply, such severance payments shall be taken into account in the calculation of any compensation payments. The current service agreements of Management Board members do not include an option to take this into account. This was included in the remuneration system and in future will be taken into account in new service agreements to be concluded with Management Board members (and any related termination agreements).\n\nThe Declaration is permanently available to the public on the Company's website at https://www.united-internet.de/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/declaration-ofconformity/2023.html. All of the Company's Declarations of Conformity in accordance with section 161 AktG since 2008 are also publicly available there.\n\nMontabaur, March 20, 2024\n\nUnited Internet AG\n\nFor the Management Board For the Supervisory Board Ralph Dommermuth Philipp von Bismarck\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\nPhilipp von Bismarck\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 8. REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) transposed Directive (EU) 2017/828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2017 into national law. As a result, new statutory requirements for remuneration reporting were introduced for listed companies, which apply to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.\n\nThe \"new\" Remuneration Report has been removed from financial reporting to create a separate report. Significant disclosures which were previously required, in particular individualized reporting on Management Board compensation and the main features of the remuneration system, have been transferred from the (Group) Management Report to the new Remuneration Report in accordance with section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe remuneration system and disclosure of compensation for members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board for the fiscal year 2023 pursuant to section 162 AktG can be found in the \"Remuneration Report 2023\", which is published on the corporate website at www.unitedinternet.de/en/investor-relations/publications/reports.html.\n\nDisclosures on Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration are also provided in note 42 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 9. DEPENDENT COMPANY REPORT\n\nIn compliance with section 312 (1) AktG, the Management Board declares that the Company received adequate compensation (quid pro quo) for all legal transactions listed in the report on relations with affiliated companies, in accordance with the circumstances known at the time when such transactions were made, and that the Company was not disadvantaged. In the reporting period, no measures were executed or omitted.\n\nMontabaur, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nR.J.J\n\nRalph Dommermuth Ralf Hartings Markus Huhn\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n144\n\n| BALANCE SHEET                                                             | 120                                                                               |     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| NET INCOME                                                                | 122                                                                               |     |\n| CASH FLOW                                                                 | 124                                                                               |     |\n| CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY                 | 126                                                                               |     |\n| NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF<br>DECEMBER 31, 2023 | 128                                                                               |     |\n| Basis of preparation and accounting policies                              | 128                                                                               |     |\n| 1.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATE-MENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n\n# 1. General information on the Company and accounting\n\nUnited Internet AG (hereinafter referred to as the \"United Internet Group\" or the \"Company\") is Europe's leading internet specialist with its business divisions Access (landline and mobile internet access products) and Applications (applications for using the internet), which are each divided into Business and Consumer segments.\n\nUnited Internet AG is domiciled in 56410 Montabaur, Elgendorfer Strasse 57, Germany and is registered there at the District Court under HR B 5762. The Group has numerous branches and subsidiaries in Germany and around the world.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of United Internet AG were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant supplementary regulations of section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB).\n\nThe reporting currency is euro (€). Amounts stated in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are in euro (€), thousand euro (€k) or million euro (€m). The Consolidated Financial Statements are always drawn up on the basis of historical costs. The exception to this rule are individual financial instruments which are stated at fair value.\n\nThe reporting date is December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2022 at its meeting on March 29, 2023. The Consolidated Financial Statements were published on March 30, 2023.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 were prepared by the Company's Management Board on March 19, 2024 and subsequently submitted to the Supervisory Board. The Consolidated Financial Statements will be presented to the Supervisory Board for approval on March 20, 2024. Theoretically, there may still be changes until the Consolidated Financial Statements are approved and released for publication by the Supervisory Board. However, the Management Board expects that the Consolidated Financial Statements will be approved in the present version. They are to be published on March 21, 2024.\n\n# 2. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nThis section first presents all accounting policies which have been applied consistently in the periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Following this, those accounting standards applied for the first time in these financial statements are explained, as are those accounting standards recently published but not yet applied.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2.1 Explanation of main accounting and measurement methods**\n\n## **Consolidation principles**\n\n \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Annual Financial Statements of United Internet AG and of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries (majority shareholdings) controlled by it. Control exists when the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect those returns. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, it has all of the following characteristics:\n\n- Power over the investee (i.e., the Group has the ability to direct those activities of the investee that have a significant effect on the investee's returns based on existing rights\n- Exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee\n- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns\n\nGenerally, holding a majority of the voting rights is presumed to result in control. To support this presumption, and when the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights or similar rights in an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over the investee. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Contractual arrangements with the other vote holders of the investee\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- Voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group\n\nIf the facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the three elements of control have changed, the Group must reassess whether it controls an investee. A subsidiary is consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control over the subsidiary. Consolidation ends when the Group loses control over the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which the Group obtains control over the subsidiary until the date on which control ends. All intercompany assets and liabilities, equity, income, and expenses, as well as cash flows from business transactions conducted between Group companies are fully eliminated during consolidation.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\nIf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest, and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. This gain or loss is calculated as the difference between (i) the proceeds from the disposal of the subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests, and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary (insofar as a reclassification to the income statement is intended), and (ii) the carrying amount of the subsidiary's net assets to be disposed of.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the proportion of the result and net assets which is not attributable to the Group's shareholders. Non-controlling interests are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. They are disclosed in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of shareholders' equity but separate to the equity capital attributable to the shareholders of United Internet AG. For purchases of shares without a controlling influence (minority shareholding) or disposals of shares with a controlling influence but without loss of the controlling influence, the carrying amounts of shares with or without a controlling influence are adjusted to reflect the change in the respective shareholding. The amount by which compensation paid or received for the change in shareholding exceeds the carrying value of the respective share without a controlling influence is recognized directly in equity as a transaction with the shareholders.\n\n## **Investments in associated companies**\n\nInvestments in associated companies are valued according to the equity method. An associated company is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the associated company, but not to control or jointly steer the decision-making processes.\n\nIn the case of successive acquisition of company shares, the carrying amount is measured using the equity method as of the date on which the prerequisites for accounting as an associated company are met. United Internet measures the old shares in the case of successive share purchases according to the retrospective method (cost-based approach). The original purchase cost of the old shares is included as acquisition cost using the equity method. Any differences between the cost of the associate thus defined and the fair value of the previously recognized investment are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nUsing the equity method, investments in associated companies are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Company's share of the net assets of the associated company. Goodwill connected with an associated company is included in the carrying value of the investment and not subjected to scheduled amortization. The income statement includes the Company's portion of the success of the associated company. Changes recognized directly in the equity capital of the associated company are recognized by the Company in proportion to its shareholding and – where applicable – reported in \"Changes in shareholders' equity\". Profits and losses from transactions between the Company and the associated company are eliminated in proportion to the shareholding in the associated company.\n\nUpon loss of significant influence, a gain or loss from the disposal of the associated company is recognized in the amount of the difference between (i) the proceeds from the disposal of the shares, the fair value of the remaining shares, and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the associated company (insofar as a reclassification to profit and loss is provided for), and (ii) the carrying amount of the investment to be disposed of.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe annual financial statements of the associated company are generally prepared as to the same reporting date as those of the parent company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the methods in line with standard group-wide accounting and measurement methods.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group ascertains whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss for the Company's investments in associated companies. If there is objective evidence that an impairment has occurred, an impairment test is carried out in the same way as for goodwill. Objective evidence exists, for example, if an associate is experiencing significant financial difficulties, has committed breaches of contract, is highly likely to become insolvent, requires restructuring, or an active market for the net investment ceases to exist because of the financial difficulties of the associate. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an associate below cost also constitutes objective evidence of impairment. A significant decline is assumed if the decrease in the fair value of an associate at the end of the reporting period is more than 25% of cost. A prolonged decline is assumed if the decrease in the fair value over a period of at least 12 months is more than 10% of the acquisition cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount is less than the associate's total carrying amount. If the recoverable amount increases in future periods, the impairment loss is reversed accordingly.\n\n## **Disclosure of disposal gains and losses from the sale of investments**\n\nInsofar as they concern effects on the income statement, regular carrying amounts and valuations of investments in associated companies are disclosed in the financial result (see explanations on the financial result).\n\nGains from the sale of such investments are always disclosed under other operating income, losses under other operating expenses.\n\n## **Foreign currency translation**\n\n \n\n#### **Functional currency and presentation currency**\n\nThe items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of all Group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the companies operate (\"functional currency\"). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro; this is the functional and presentation currency of United Internet AG.\n\n#### **Transactions and balances**\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing when the transactions occurred. Currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are generally recognized in profit or loss. They are deferred in equity if they result from net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nCurrency gains and losses relating to borrowings are recognized as financial expenses in the income statement. All other currency gains and losses are disclosed net as other operating income/expenses in the income statement.\n\nNon-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates prevailing when fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried \n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nat fair value are disclosed as part of the gain or loss on fair value measurement. Translation differences from non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on fair value measurement, and translation differences from equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are disclosed in other comprehensive income.\n\n#### **Group companies**\n\nThe expenses, income, assets, and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- Assets and liabilities are translated for each balance sheet presented as of the respective balance sheet date\n- Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for each presentation of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of translation at the transaction rates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date), and\n- All resulting translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn consolidation, currency differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign operations and from borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments are recognized in other comprehensive income. If a foreign operation is sold or borrowings that form part of the net investment are repaid, the related currency differences are reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nGoodwill and amounts to adjust the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities from the acquisition of a foreign operation to fair value are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at closing rates.\n\n(in relation to 1 €)\n\n| Labels | Values        |\n|--------|---------------|\n|        | Closing rate  |\n|        | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|        | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|        | Average rat   |\n|        | 2023          |\n\nThe exchange rates of major currencies developed as follows:\n\n| (in relation to 1 €) | Closing rate  |               | Average rate |       |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n|                      | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 | 2023         | 2022  |\n| US dollar            | 1.108         | 1.068         | 1.081        | 1.052 |\n| UK pound             | 0.869         | 0.887         | 0.870        | 0.852 |\n\n## **Revenue recognition**\n\n#### **Revenue from contracts with customers**\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is accounted for using the following five steps:\n\n- Identification of the contract or contracts with a customer\n- Identification of distinct performance obligations in the contract\n- Determination of the transaction price\n- Allocation of transaction price to the performance obligations\n- Revenue recognition on fulfillment of performance obligations\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue is recognized separately for each of the Group's different segments (see also explanations on segment reporting in Note 5).\n\nRevenues in the separate segments are recognized according to the following principles:\n\n#### **Consumer Access segment**\n\n \n\n> The Consumer Access segment mainly comprises landline-based and mobile-based internet access products. The range comprises \"Mobile Internet\" and \"Broadband\".\n\nIn these product lines, the Group generates revenue from the provision of the aforementioned access products, as well as from additional services such as internet and mobile telephony. The transaction price consists of fixed monthly basic fees, as well as variable additional usage fees for certain services (e.g., for foreign calls and mobile phone connections not covered by any flat-rate), and proceeds from the sale of the respective hardware.\n\nRevenue recognition is based on a separation of the transaction price for the customer contract on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of the individual performance obligations. The United Internet Group generally offers comparable tariffs both with and without hardware. In these cases, the standalone selling price for the service component is therefore based on the tariff conditions of a service tariff without hardware. By contrast, the standalone selling prices for hardware are determined on the basis of the adjusted market assessment approach, as only a very small amount of the relevant hardware is sold to customers without a mobile contract. In this connection, the Group primarily uses hardware prices determined and regularly provided by a third-party provider and links these to the contractual terms and conditions specified when the contract is concluded.\n\nThe resulting revenue share allocated to hardware is recognized on delivery to the customer (timerelated revenue recognition). It usually exceeds the fee invoiced to the customer and then results in the recognition of a contract asset. This contract asset value is reduced by the customer's payments over the contract period. The revenue share allocated to the service component is recognized over the minimum term of the customer contract (period-related revenue recognition).\n\nIf the one-off fees invoiced to the customer on conclusion of the contract, such as activation fees, do not represent a material right (e.g., favorable renewal option), these are not recognized as a separate performance obligation but are allocated to the identified performance obligations as part of the transaction price and recognized in accordance with their performance. If the customer is granted material rights in the form of options to use additional goods or services, these represent an additional performance obligation to which part of the transaction price is allocated, taking into account the expected utilization. The corresponding revenue is recognized when these future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires. If one-off fees qualify as a favorable renewal option, revenue is recognized over the expected duration of the customer contract.\n\nThe United Internet Group grants its customers time-limited promotion discounts at the time of contract conclusion. These discounts are included in the calculation of the transaction price and are allocated to the performance obligations by means of an allocation mechanism.\n\nWithin the context of the 1&1 Principle, United Internet grants its customers a voluntary 30-day right of cancellation. If customers make use of the 1&1 Principle and cancel their contracts, they have the right to be reimbursed for individual transaction components, such as one-off fees and basic fees which have been invoiced. Any usage fees are excluded from the reimbursement claim. In return, United Internet has the right to demand the return of any hardware supplied. No revenue is recog\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nnized for expected customer cancellations. The payments received from the customer and to be reimbursed are carried as reimbursement liabilities and the claims for reimbursement resulting from the 1&1 Principle for delivered hardware are disclosed as non-financial assets.\n\nIn determining the transaction price, United Internet reviewed the materiality of a financing component. An analysis of current customer contracts determined that the financing components are not to be considered material. However, a change in the assumed interest rates or tariffs could lead to a significant financing component in the future. The financing effect is therefore reviewed for materiality at regular intervals.\n\n1&1 applies the portfolio approach as permitted by IFRS 15.4 for a part of its stock of contracts. In this case, customer contracts of the same kind are pooled and average values taken for certain valuation-relevant parameters, in particular transaction prices, standalone selling prices, and amortization periods.\n\nIt can be reasonably assumed that whether a portfolio or the individual contracts or performance obligations within this portfolio are assessed, it will have no material impact on the annual financial statements.\n\n#### **Business Access segment**\n\nThe Business Access segment comprises revenue from various standardized and customized telecommunications products for business and wholesale customers. In addition to the provision of traditional landline connections, the telecommunications services also include broadband services, network solutions as telecommunications infrastructure (leased lines) or VPN, added-value services, interconnection, IP services, and cloud solutions.\n\nIn the case of products that do not meet the definition of a finance lease pursuant to IAS 16, the transaction price consists of fixed monthly basic fees and/or variable, additional per-minute usage fees for certain services (which are not covered by a flat rate) and, to an insignificant extent, revenue from the sale of related hardware. Revenue recognition is based on a separation of the transaction price for the customer contract on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of the individual performance obligations. The transaction price for the sale of hardware is based on standard market prices. The standalone selling price for the service component is based on the tariff conditions of a comparable service tariff without hardware.\n\nTemporary discounts or basic fee exemptions are also granted to a lesser extent at the beginning of the term. These discounts are included in the transaction price and allocated on a straight-line basis in the course of revenue recognition.\n\nCertain products are provided on a lease basis. If all material opportunities and risks from a lease are transferred to the lessee, the present value of the minimum lease payments from this economic sale is recognized as revenue on commencement of the lease; as part of the subsequent accounting of finance lease receivables, interest income is recognized in subsequent periods. Leased assets are derecognized through cost of sales. In addition to the monthly payments, the minimum lease payments include any customer activation fees payable at the beginning of the lease term.\n\nIn the case of operating leases, where the lessor retains the material opportunities and risks, the lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Activation fees for operating leases are deferred and amortized over the lease term.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Consumer Applications segment**\n\n \n\n> The Consumer Applications segment comprises United Internet's consumer application business – whether ad-financed or via fee-based subscriptions –as well as the sales platforms for fee-based partner products.\n\n> Besides Germany, the United Internet Group also operates in Austria and the USA in this segment.\n\nIn the field of ad-financed applications (generally free e-mail solutions from GMX and WEB.DE), the Group generates advertising income and e-commerce commission mainly via the WEB.DE, 1&1, GMX, and smartshopping portals. This business is based on the frequent use of free applications and the correspondingly high number of hits for the portals. In the field of online advertising, space is offered on the websites of portals. Revenues are generated depending on the placing of advertising and number of screenings or according to click rates. In its e-commerce business, the Group receives commissions for the sale of products or brokerage of customers. For these products, revenue is recognized at a specific point in time.\n\nIn the field of fee-based subscriptions for the WEB.DE, 1&1, GMX, and smartshopping portals, revenue is mainly generated from fixed monthly fees for the use of extended applications, as well as for administration and storage. Customers generally pay in advance for a contractually fixed time period for the services to be provided by the Company. Revenue is recognized pro rata over the period of service provision. The payments received in advance result in contractual liabilities which are reduced accordingly over the performance period.\n\nRevenues from partner products (affiliates) are recognized and measured according to the Group's intermediary function. A distinction is made as to whether the delivery or service provided to the end customer results in delivery revenue and the Group is thus acting on its own account (principal) or whether the Group's services are limited to brokerage or commission (agent). Acting as a principal is assumed if the Group controls the goods or services owed to the end customer before they are transferred to the customer. Acting as an agent is assumed if the Group's performance obligation is basically to broker the supply of goods and services of another company.\n\n#### **Business Applications segment**\n\nIn the Business Applications segment, a wide range of e-mail, hosting, cloud, and e-business applications are offered for freelancers, small and medium-sized businesses, and home users. These applications include domains, websites, and e-shops, Personal Information Management applications (email, to-do lists, appointments, addresses), group work, online storage, and office software. The Group also offers its customers performance-based advertising and sales opportunities via Sedo.\n\nIn this segment, the United Internet Group is active in Germany, as well as – in particular – France, the UK, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Italy, Canada, Mexico, and the USA. It is one of the leading companies in all the countries mentioned. The services are rendered by various subsidiaries of the United Internet Group in Germany and abroad.\n\nCustomers generally pay in advance for a contractually fixed time period for the services to be provided by the Company. The main service in the product group Domains consists of domain registration for the end customer with the respective registry. With regard to the time-related recognition of revenue from domain registration, the special regulations regarding licenses are applied. As in the case of domains, a right of use is granted to an intellectual property existing at the time the license is granted (static), revenue is recognized at a specific moment in time.\n\nProduct groups that contain domains as part of multiple-element arrangements primarily relate to web hosting products. The web hosting packages offered usually combine domain registrations with \n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nfurther services, such as storage capacity (Webspace) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The service Webspace concerns the provision of storage space on servers at the data centers of the United Internet Group. SaaS refers to the customer's use of software (e.g., to create websites) hosted on servers of the United Internet Group. Both the Webspace and SaaS services are performance obligations based on time periods, as the customer benefits continuously from the corresponding flow of benefits.\n\nCustomer contracts in the web hosting product category generally comprise several separate performance obligations, which are recognized both on a time-related basis (domain registration performance obligation) and a period-related basis (Webspace and SaaS performance obligation). The total fee for the customer contract is therefore allocated to the various performance obligations. In the absence of separate standalone selling prices for Webspace and SaaS, and a high degree of price variability, the residual method is used to allocate the total fee. The revenue share attributable to the period-related services is therefore determined on the basis of the total fee less the standalone selling price of the included domains.\n\nIn addition to application revenue, this segment also includes revenue from the performance-based advertising form of domain marketing.\n\nIn Domain Marketing, United Internet operates (via Sedo GmbH) a trading platform for the secondary domain market (domain trading). At the same time, the Group offers domain owners the possibility to market unused domains to advertisers (domain parking). In addition to these customer domains, the Group also holds its own portfolio of marketable and salable domains. In domain trading, the Group receives sales commission from the successful sale of domains via the platform and also generates revenue from services relating to domain value assessments and transfers. The sales commissions and services are generally based on a percentage of the sales price achieved, whereas fixed prices are generally charged for the other services. In domain parking, domains are mainly marketed using text links, i.e., links on the parked domains to offers of the advertisers (primarily via cooperation agreements with search engines). The Group receives performance-based payment on a monthly basis from the cooperation partner on a pay-per-click basis, according to the number of clicks registered by the cooperation partner.\n\nThe Group recognizes sales commissions as revenue when the service is rendered. Revenue is thus recognized on completion of the transaction or provision of the service. In the case of domain parking, the monthly payments credited by cooperation partners are recognized as revenue.\n\n## **Government grants**\n\nGovernment grants are recognized where there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and the Company will satisfy all attaching conditions. Where the grants relate to an expense item, they are recognized as income in scheduled amounts over the period necessary to match the grants to the costs they are intended to compensate. Grants relating to an asset item reduce the carrying value of that item.\n\n## **Electricity price brake**\n\nIn the current fiscal year, the Group made use of the support provided by the German Electricity Price Brake Act in order to respond to the rise in energy costs. In accordance with IAS 20.29, the receipt of the relief amount or subsidy was recognized in the income statement as a reduction of the corresponding primary expense. It should be noted that the final settlement of the utilization of the electricity\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nprice brake was still outstanding at the time of preparing the financial statements. The provisional amount of the utilization is in the lower million range.\n\n## **Financial income**\n\n \n\nInterest income is recognized as interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, i.e., the rate which discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income is recognized with the inception of the legal right to payment.\n\n## **Income taxes**\n\nThe tax expense for a period comprises current taxes and deferred taxes. Taxes are recognized in the income statement, unless they relate to transactions that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In these cases, taxes are recognized accordingly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent taxes are valued at the amount at which a refund from the tax authorities or a payment to the tax authorities is expected. The amount is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and tax laws applicable on the reporting date in those countries in which the Group operates and generates taxable income, or which will soon apply.\n\nThe liability method is used to create deferred taxes on all temporary differences existing on the reporting date between the carrying value of an asset or a liability in the balance sheet and the fiscal carrying value.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except\n\n- where the deferred tax liability from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the profit according to IFRS nor taxable profit or loss, and\n- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except\n\n- where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the profit or loss according to IFRS nor taxable profit or loss, and\n- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable income will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted as of the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n## **Sales tax**\n\nExpenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except for the following cases:\n\n- When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.\n- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## **Intangible assets**\n\nThe Group has control over an asset if it is able to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and can restrict the access of third parties to these benefits. Individually acquired intangible assets are carried at cost on initial recognition. The acquisition cost of intangible assets resulting from the business combination corresponds to its fair value at the time of acquisition. In the following periods, intangible assets are valued at cost less cumulative amortization and cumulative impairment charges.\n\nWith the exception of those development costs which can be capitalized, costs for internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the period incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs for a single project are only capitalized as intangible assets if the Group can demonstrate the following:\n\n- The completion of the intangible asset can be technically realized to the extent that it can be used or sold;\n- United Internet intends to complete the intangible asset and to use or sell it;\n- United Internet has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- The way in which the intangible asset is expected to generate future economic benefits; United Internet may demonstrate, for example, the existence of a market for the products of the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n Adequate technical, financial, and other resources are available so that the development can be completed and the intangible asset can be used or sold;\n\n \n\n United Internet has the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nA distinction is made between usable intangible assets with finite and indefinite useful lives and intangible assets which are not yet usable (spectrum licenses).\n\nIntangible assets with limited useful lives are amortized over their economic useful life and tested for possible impairment if there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. Intangible assets that are not yet usable are also tested for possible impairment. The impairment test is conducted in the same way as for goodwill. The useful lives and amortization methods of intangible assets with limited useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each fiscal year. Necessary changes to the depreciation method and useful life are treated as changes to assumptions.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets with limited useful lives are recognized in the income statement under the expense category corresponding to the function of the intangible asset in the Company.\n\nAmortization of capitalized development costs begins from the point in time at which the asset can be used. It is recognized over the period during which future benefits are expected and recognized in the expense category that reflects the function of the intangible asset. An impairment test is performed annually during the development phase.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as intangible assets not yet usable, are not amortized in scheduled amounts. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once annually at the end of the reporting period for the individual asset or on the level of the cash-generating unit. The impairment test is conducted in the same way as for goodwill. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to ascertain whether the assumption of an indefinite useful life is still justified. If this is not the case, a prospective change is made from indefinite useful life to limited useful life. Amortization of intangible assets which are not yet usable (spectrum licenses) will begin at the time of actual network operation.\n\nThe useful life periods can be found in the following summary:\n\n|                                        | Useful life in years |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Trademarks                             | Indefinite           |\n| Customer base                          | 4 to 25              |\n| Spectrum licenses                      | up to 19             |\n| Rights similar to concessions          | 5                    |\n| Other rights and licenses              | 2 to 15              |\n| Software                               | 2 to 5               |\n| Rights of use intangible assets        | 6                    |\n| Internally generated intangible assets | 3 to 5               |\n\nA review is also conducted on each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that a previously recognized impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased in size. In the case of such an indication, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is only reversed if there has been a change in the assumption used to determine the recoverable amount since recognition of the last impairment loss. If this is the case, the asset's carrying value is raised to its recoverable amount. This amount may not exceed the carrying amount, less depreciation, that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Property, plant and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is always carried at cost less cumulative scheduled depreciation.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are eliminated either on their disposal or when no further economic use is expected from the continued use or sale of the asset. Gains and losses from the disposal of an asset are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted where necessary.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their expected economic useful life using the straight-line method.\n\nThe useful life periods can be found in the following summary:\n\n|                                        | Useful life in years |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Leasehold improvements                 | up to 10             |\n| Buildings                              | 10 or 50             |\n| Vehicles                               | 5 to 6               |\n| Telecommunication equipment            | 7 to 10              |\n| Distribution grids                     | 25                   |\n| Other operational and office equipment | 3 to 19              |\n| Office furniture and fixtures          | 5 to 13              |\n| Servers                                | 3 to 5               |\n\nFor property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with company acquisitions, the applicable remaining useful life is determined primarily on the basis of the aforementioned useful lives and the useful lives elapsed at the time of acquisition.\n\nImpairment tests and the recognition of impairment losses or reversals are conducted in the same way as for intangible assets with limited useful lives (see below).\n\n## **Borrowing costs**\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless they are connected with the production or purchase of a qualifying asset. As in the previous year, there was no need to capitalize borrowing costs during the reporting period.\n\n## **Business combinations and goodwill**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. This involves the recognition of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operation at fair value.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe initial recognition of goodwill results from the excess of the acquisition cost of the entity over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Following initial recognition, goodwill is valued at amortized cost. Goodwill is subjected to an impairment test at least once annually or whenever there is any event or change in circumstances which might indicate impairment.\n\nIn order to test whether there is any impairment, goodwill acquired in the course of a business combination must be allocated from the date of acquisition to each of the cash-generating units of the Group which are to profit from the synergy effects of the combination. This does not depend on whether other assets and liabilities of the Group are already allocated to these cash-generating units.\n\nThe impairment need is determined by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill refers with their carrying value. The recoverable amount of an asset, or a cash-generating unit, is the higher of fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit less transaction costs and its value-in-use. In order to determine the value-in-use, expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market expectations regarding the interest effect and the specific risks of the asset. A suitable measurement model is used to determine fair value less sales costs. This is based on DCF models, valuation multipliers, the share prices of listed subsidiaries or other available indicators for fair value. If the carrying amount of an asset, or cashgenerating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset, or cash-generating unit, is regarded as impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill may not be reversed in the following reporting periods. The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## **Contract assets**\n\n \n\nA contract asset is the Group's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services it has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Every unconditional right to consideration is disclosed separately as a receivable. Contract assets are regularly assessed for impairment. The procedure is the same as for financial assets.\n\n## **Inventories**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value comprises the estimated sales proceeds, realizable in the ordinary course of business, less estimated necessary selling costs. Adequate allowances for excess inventories are made to provide for inventory risks.\n\nMeasurement is also based in part on time-related writedowns for inventories. Both the size and distribution over time of such writedowns represents a best-possible estimation of net realizable value and are thus subject to uncertainties. On indication of decreased net realizable value, inventories are corrected by recognizing suitable impairment charges.\n\n## **Contract initiation and contract fulfillment costs**\n\nAdditional costs incurred in initiating a contract with a customer (e.g., sales commissions) are capitalized if the Group expects to recover these costs.\n\nIn addition, the Group capitalizes the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer (e.g., customer activation fees and expected termination fees) if these costs are\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n- not within the scope of a standard other than IFRS 15 (e.g., IAS 2 Inventories, IAS 16 Property, Plant, and Equipment or IAS 38 Intangible Assets),\n- related to an existing or expected contract,\n- for the creation of resources or the improvement of resources of the Company that will be used in the future for the (continued) fulfillment of performance obligations, and\n- likely to lead to an expected settlement of the costs.\n\nCapitalized contract initiation and fulfillment costs are amortized over the estimated period of use. They are recognized in the balance sheet within deferred expenses. The amortization of contract initiation costs is disclosed in selling expenses and the amortization of contract fulfillment costs is disclosed in cost of sales.\n\nThe amortization periods for contract initiation costs are 1 to 5 years and for contract fulfillment costs 2 to 4 years.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the capitalized costs exceeds the remaining amount of the customer's expected consideration for the delivery of goods or the rendering of services less the costs still to be incurred.\n\n## **Classification as current and non-current**\n\nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities in the balance sheet as current and non-current assets and liabilities. An asset is classified as current if\n\n- the asset is expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle or the asset is held for sale or consumption within that period,\n- the asset is held primarily for the purpose of trading,\n- the asset is expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting date or\n- the asset is cash or a cash equivalent, unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for a period of at least twelve months after the reporting date.\n\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\n\nA liability is current if\n\n- it is expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle,\n- it is held primarily for the purpose of trading,\n- it is due to be settled within twelve months after the end of the reporting period or\n- the Group has no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\n## **Non-current assets held for sale**\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount \n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nand fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nThe criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the balance sheet.\n\n## **Leases**\n\n \n\nUnited Internet acts as both lessee and lessor. The majority of the Group's lessee contracts relate to the renting of network infrastructure, buildings, technical equipment and vehicles. In the case of buildings, various rental objects/leased items such as space (office space, computer center space, storage space or parking space etc.) may be listed as contractual objects (i.e., for rental by UI). The rented network infrastructure mainly comprises unlit fiber-optic cable (dark fiber), empty conduit systems, copper twin wires, leases of subscriber lines (local loops), and antenna locations.\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement contains a lease is based on the economic substance of the arrangement at the time of signing and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.\n\nA lease only exists if the lessee obtains control over the right of use. The lessee obtains control if they have the right to obtain substantially the entire economic benefit from the use of the identified asset and have sole control over the use of the asset.\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## **Group as lessee**\n\n#### Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancelable basic term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                | Useful life in years |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                      | 1 to 17              |\n| Network infrastructure         | 0.5 to 25            |\n| Intangible assets              | 6                    |\n| Operating and office equipment | 1 to 7               |\n\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n#### Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including de facto fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is used to measure right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of reference interest rates for a period of up to 17 years from risk-free interest rates with appropriate maturities, increased by credit risk premiums.\n\n#### Short-term leases, leases of low-value assets, and other policy choices\n\nThe standard includes exemptions from accounting according to IFRS 16 in the case of short-term leases (e.g., leases with a term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (e.g., PCs) for which right-of-use assets are not recognized. IFRS 16 is to be initially applied in fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2019. United Internet only has a small amount short-term leases, which are thus not capitalized according to IFRS 16 for reasons of materiality. In the case of leases of low-value assets – which only exist to a limited extent – the Group opts not to carry them according to IFRS 16 on a case-by-case basis. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low- value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThere is an option to form a portfolio of contracts with the same or similar characteristics. This option has been used for the asset classes subscriber lines (local loop) and main distribution frame locations (MDFs).\n\nThe option to recognize each lease component of a contract and all related non-lease components as a single lease component is applied for the asset classes underlying fiber-optic, MDFs, and cars, but not to lease arrangements for buildings.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Group as lessor**\n\n \n\nIn those cases where Group companies agree finance leases as the lessor, a receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The lease payments are apportioned between repayment of principal and finance income.\n\nIf the Group bears all substantial risks and rewards (operating lease), the leased asset is recognized in the balance sheet by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss by the lessor.\n\n## **Fair value measurement**\n\nIn some cases, assets and liabilities are measured either on initial recognition or during subsequent valuations at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- in the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n- in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nFair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses measurement techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- Level 1 quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 measurement techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable\n- Level 3 measurement techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics, and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## **Financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## **Financial assets – initial recognition and measurement**\n\nWith the exception of trade accounts receivable that do not contain a significant financing component or have a maturity of less than one year, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Trade accounts receivable that do not contain a significant financing component or have a maturity of less than one year are measured at the transaction price. In this context, reference is made to the accounting policies in the section Revenue Recognition – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that provide for delivery of the assets within a period determined by the rules or conventions of the respective market (standard market purchases) are recognized as of the trading date, i.e., the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\n## **Financial assets – subsequent measurement**\n\nFor subsequent measurement purposes, the classification of financial assets on initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and the Group's business model for managing financial assets. For subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories:\n\n- Financial assets (debt instruments) at amortized cost (ac)\n- Financial assets (equity instruments) at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (fvoci)\n- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl)\n\n## **Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)**\n\nThe Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and\n- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.\n\n## **Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments) with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition**\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income if they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established unless the dividends recover part of the cost of the financial asset. In this case, such gains are recognized in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\n## **Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss**\n\n \n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets must be classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are also classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. Debt instruments may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.\n\nA derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the host, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\n## **Financial assets – derecognition**\n\nA financial asset (or part of a financial asset, or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet) if one of the following conditions is met:\n\nThe rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'passthrough' arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\n\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income for financial assets measured at fair value in other comprehensive income are reclassified to cumulative profit or loss. In the case of a pro rata disposal, a pro rata transfer is made.\n\n## **Impairment of financial assets**\n\nFor trade accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified (one-step) method for calculating expected credit losses, whereby a loss allowance based on expected credit losses over the remaining term is recognized at each reporting date.\n\nExpectations of future credit losses are formed on the basis of regular reviews and measurements as part of credit monitoring. Historical data is regularly used to derive relationships between credit losses and various factors (e.g., payment agreement, overdue period, dunning level etc.). On the basis of these relationships, supplemented by current observations and forward-looking assumptions regarding the portfolio of receivables and contract assets held as of the reporting date, an estimate of future credit losses is made.\n\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt instruments which are not held at fair value through profit or loss and are not trade accounts receivable. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. Expected credit losses are recognized in two stages. For financial instruments for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized in the amount of the expected credit losses based on a default event within the next twelve months. For those financial instruments for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized in the amount of the credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default.\n\nThe Group's operating business is mainly in the mass customer business. Default risks are thus taken into account by means of individual value adjustments and lump-sum individual value adjustments. The specific bad debt allowances for overdue receivables are mainly based on the age structure of the receivables with different valuation discounts, which are mainly derived from the success rates of those collection agencies commissioned to collect overdue receivables. The age structure of receivables is shown in Note 19. All receivables that are more than 365 days overdue are written down individually by \n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n100%, unless there is objective evidence of successful recovery. Fully impaired trade accounts receivable are derecognized 180 days after collection has been handed over to the collection agency, unless the agency has given positive feedback or payment for an impaired receivable is unexpectedly received, or if the customer's inability to pay is known before or after transfer to the collection agencies.\n\nImpairment charges in connection with non-current loans to affiliates are recognized in the financial result.\n\nFurther details on the impairment of trade accounts receivable and contract assets are provided in the following Notes:\n\n- Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions (Note3)\n- Trade accounts receivable (Note 19)\n- Contract assets (Note 20)\n\n \n\nObjectives and methods of financial risk management (Note 43)\n\n## **Financial liabilities – initial recognition and measurement**\n\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, or as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## **Financial liabilities – subsequent measurement**\n\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification:\n\n- At Fair Value through Profit or Loss (fvtpl). This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group, as well as contingent purchase price liabilities in connection with company acquisitions. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading. Gains or losses on financial liabilities held for trading are recognized through profit or loss.\n- Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost (flac). After initial recognition, financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization using the effective interest method is included as part of finance costs in the income statement.\n\n## **Financial liabilities – derecognition**\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, canceled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the liability.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Offsetting of financial instruments**\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## **Financial instruments – derivative financial instruments and hedging relationships**\n\nThe Group occasionally uses derivative financial instruments in order to hedge against interest and exchange rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the date of the agreement and carried at fair value in the subsequent periods. The fair value of interest derivatives is calculated on the basis of present value models using market information (interest rate curves) as well as – where material – the individual credit risk of the Company. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative. Profit or loss resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhen entering into a hedging relationship to hedge against the risk of cash flow fluctuations, certain derivatives are allocated to underlying transactions which can be attributed to a risk connected with a recognized asset or liability or the risk connected with the intended transaction (cash flow hedge). The hedging instruments in a hedge are also carried at market values. However, changes in value relating to the effective portion are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve, a separate item under equity (\"Cash flow hedge reserve\"). Any ineffectiveness is recognized in profit or loss. Effectiveness is measured as at the end of the reporting period using the hypothetical derivative method. The amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the hedge influences the period result, e.g., when hedged financial income or expenses are recognized or when an expected sale is made.\n\n## **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances, other investments, checks and cash in hand, which all have a high degree of liquidity and maturities of less than 3 months – calculated from the date of purchase.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.\n\n## **Pensions and other post-employment benefits**\n\nPayments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are expensed on payment of salary to the employee.\n\n## **Contract liabilities**\n\nA contract liability is the Group's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration from the customer. If a customer provides consideration before the Group has transferred goods or services to the customer, a contractual liability is recognized at the\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\ntime of payment or at the latest at the time when the payment becomes due. Contractual liabilities are recognized as revenue as soon as the Group fulfills the contractual obligations.\n\n## **Accruals**\n\n \n\nAccruals are formed if the Group has a present legal or actual obligation resulting from a past event, and it is probable that the settlement of the obligation will give rise to the outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. No accruals are formed for future operating losses.\n\nAccruals are measured at present value based on management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the accrual due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.\n\nIf the Group expects at least partial compensation for a recognized accrual (e.g., in the case of an insurance policy), this compensation is recognized as a separate asset if the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense from forming the accrual is recognized in the income statement after deducting the reimbursement.\n\n## **Treasury shares**\n\nTreasury shares are deducted from shareholders' equity. The purchase, sale, issue or retirement of treasury shares is not recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe cancellation of treasury shares results in the pro rata reversal of the item \"Treasury shares\" disclosed in shareholders' equity at the expense of the remaining shareholders' equity. The Group uses the following application sequence:\n\n- The cancellation of treasury shares is always deducted from share capital in the amount of the par value.\n- The amount exceeding par value is first derecognized in the amount of the value contribution from employee stock ownership plans (SARs and convertible bonds) against capital reserves.\n- Any amount exceeding the value contribution from employee stock ownership plans is derecognized against accumulated profit.\n\n## **Share-based payment**\n\nGroup employees and Management Board members receive share-based payments as remuneration for their work in the form of equity instruments and the granting of stock appreciation rights, which for the majority of plans may be settled in cash or via equity instruments at the Company's discretion. As the United Internet Group has no current obligation to settle in cash for any agreement with such an option, all share-based payment transactions are carried in the balance sheet as equity-settled transactions.\n\nThe cost of such equity-settled agreements is measured using the fair value of such equity instruments on the date of granting. Fair value is measured using a suitable option price model; the Black-Scholes\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nmodel and Monte Carlo simulation are employed for this purpose. At each balance sheet date, the expected exercise volume is reassessed with a corresponding adjustment of the additional amount. Any necessary adjustment bookings are to be made in the period in which new information about the exercise volume becomes available. Expenses from the granting of equity-settled agreements are recognized over the period in which the related service is rendered (the so-called vesting period). This period ends on the date on which all vesting conditions (service and performance conditions) are fulfilled, i.e., the date on which the employee concerned has gained irrevocable entitlement. The cumulative expenses recognized on each reporting date until the vesting date reflect the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best-possible estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. A fluctuation probability of 0% is applied in each case. The income or expense recognized in personnel expenses for the period represents the development of cumulative expenses recognized at the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n\nWhen new equity instruments are granted as a result of the cancellation of previously granted equity instruments, IFRS 2.28(c) requires an entity to assess whether the newly granted equity instruments are a replacement for the previously granted or canceled instruments. For canceled equity instruments, the full outstanding expense is recognized immediately at the time of cancellation.\n\nIf they are classified as a replacement, the new equity instruments are accounted for in the same way as an amendment to the original instruments granted. New equity instruments that are not granted as a replacement for canceled equity instruments are accounted for as newly granted equity instruments. The benefits received are recognized at least at the fair value determined on the grant date (of the original instruments). If the amendments are beneficial to the employee, the additional fair value of the new equity instruments is measured and allocated over the vesting period as an additional expense. The additional fair value is measured as the difference between the fair value of the equity instruments identified as a replacement and the net fair value of the canceled equity instruments on the date on which the replacement instruments are granted.\n\n## **Earnings per share**\n\nUndiluted or basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the result attributable to the holders of registered shares by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated similarly to basic earnings per share with the exception that the average number of shares outstanding increases by the portion which would result if the exercisable subscription rights resulting from employee stock participation programs had been exercised.\n\n## **2.2 Summary of measurement principles**\n\nThe Group's measurement principles can be summarized and simplified as follows – providing there is no impairment:\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Balance sheet item                                   | Measurement

Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\n\nThe application of accounting and measurement methods in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make certain accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These have an effect on the disclosed amounts of earnings, expenditure, assets and liabilities, as well as contingent liabilities, as of the reporting date. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which may lead in future to significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities concerned.\n\n## **Judgments, estimates, and assumptions**\n\nIn the application of accounting and measurement methods, management made the following accounting judgments which significantly affect amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe most important forward-looking assumptions and other major sources of uncertainty as of the reporting date, which involve the risk of significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the coming fiscal year, are explained below.\n\n## **Impact of geopolitical crises**\n\n \n\nSociety, politics and the economy are currently facing complex macroeconomic challenges resulting from a combination of high interest rates, subdued growth expectations, a tense financing framework, falling trade growth and declining confidence among companies and consumers. In addition to the destabilizing effects of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East is also contributing to greater uncertainty about the economic future. The United Internet Group is responding to this by actively accepting the current challenges and integrating them into its business decisions, in particular by developing strategies to minimize risk, such as reducing the proportion of variable-interest debt or through diversified procurement strategies to ensure a secure and fair energy supply.\n\nAlthough the United Internet Group has no business activities in the countries involved in the wars, it is still confronted with the indirect effects. In view of the uncertain security situation caused by the war in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, especially surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, and the potential indirect effects on global business activities, United Internet has developed proactive risk management and mitigation strategies:\n\n- Cybersecurity risks: due to the increased cybersecurity threats associated with the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, the Company is stepping up its investment in cybersecurity measures. These include the use of advanced monitoring technologies, conducting regular security audits and training employees to improve their resistance to cyberattacks.\n- Hardware bottlenecks: the Company is adapting its logistics and procurement strategies in order to overcome potential hardware bottlenecks that could be caused by the uncertain security situation surrounding the entrance and passage of the Suez Canal, exacerbated by the war in the Middle East. Among other things, this is being done by increasing the stock of hardware in order to cushion potential supply disruptions.\n\nThe Management Board and the operational managers will closely monitor further developments and initiate any appropriate countermeasures (if possible).\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnited Internet also takes account of developments in the economic environment in its accounting and reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements, e.g., when determining the recoverability of goodwill or the measurement of assets and liabilities.\n\nThese developments are not expected to have any significant direct impact on United Internet.\n\n## **Impact of climate change**\n\nEnvironmental and social concerns can impact the recoverability of Group assets in various ways. In particular, these risks include rising energy prices for renewable energies to operate our 5G mobile communications network. The recoverability of the 5G spectrum was reviewed as part of the impairment test (Note 29).\n\nThe Company currently assumes that any impact caused by environmental and social issues will not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## **Revenue recognition**\n\nThe standalone selling prices for hardware are determined on the basis of the adjusted market assessment approach, which requires an estimate of the relevant market prices for the respective hardware. Changes in these estimates may affect the allocation of the transaction price to the individual performance obligations and thus also affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n\nIn addition, various other assumptions and estimates are made during application of the portfolio approach, which are based on past experience and available knowledge at the end of the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions and estimates in their entirety can also have a material effect on the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n\nThe guiding principle for considering whether an entity is acting as a principal or as an agent is whether it has control over the specified good or service before transferring it to the customer. When examining the question of control, significant discretionary decisions often have to be made. This relates in particular to services in connection with the marketing of websites and the sale of third-party products and services by the Group. When a third party is involved in the performance process, the entity must determine whether the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide the specific good/service itself (i.e., the entity is a principal) or whether the performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of those goods/services by the third party (i.e., the entity is an agent). An entity determines for each specific good/service whether it acts as principal or agent. If the Group acts as an agent, sales are recognized on a net basis. If we act as principal, sales are reported gross.\n\n## **Costs of contract fulfillment and contract initiation**\n\nThe calculation of the estimated amortization periods for contract costs is based on past experience and subject to significant uncertainties, in particular with regard to unforeseen customer or technology developments. A change in the estimated amortization period affects the timing of the recognition. The carrying amount of capitalized contract initiation and contract fulfillment costs as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 303,145k (prior year: € 246,569k).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Impairment of non-financial assets**\n\n \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as not yet usable assets with finite useful lives, are assessed at least once a year or on indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable value of the respective cash-generating unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated is calculated either as \"value-in-use\" or fair value less cost of sell. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill was € 3,628,849k (prior year: € 3,623,435k).\n\nIn order to estimate value-in-use or fair value less cost of sell, management must estimate expected future cash flows of the asset or cash-generating unit and select a suitable discount rate to assess the present value of these cash flows.\n\nFurther details, including a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions, are presented in the Note \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\".\n\nThe most important management assumptions for the measurement of the recoverable value of cashgenerating units include assumptions regarding the development of sales, margins, and the discount rate.\n\n## **Carrying amounts and impairment test for investments in associated companies**\n\nAs of the reporting date, the United Internet Group holds investments in various associated companies. If the consideration for the acquisition of the shares is made by contributing a subsidiary or other investment, the acquisition costs of the associated company are to be determined by means of a company valuation. This valuation is closely related to the assumptions and estimates made by management with respect to the future development of the respective company and the applicable discount rate.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28.40, the Group examines on the reporting date whether the net investment of the United Internet Group in the respective associated company requires an additional impairment charge.\n\nThe carrying amount for shares in associated companies is measured on the basis of their prorated annual results. If the annual results for the fiscal year are not known, an estimate is made on the basis of the latest publicly available financial information of the respective associated company.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of non-listed companies consider both the available past experience for the respective company and expectations of its future development. As these expectations are based on numerous assumptions, the calculation of recoverable amounts depends on discretionary factors. The carrying value of investments in non-listed associated companies as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 373,205k (prior year: € 429,304k).\n\n## **Share-based payment**\n\nFor share-based payment arrangements, the cost of equity-settled arrangements is measured at the fair value of such equity instruments on the date of granting. In the case of share-based payment arrangements with cash settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement. A suitable measurement model must be used to estimate fair value when granting equity instruments; this depends on the contractual terms. Suitable data must also be chosen\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor the valuation process, including the expected option term, volatility, exercise behavior, and dividend yield, as well as the corresponding assumptions.\n\nIn the reporting period, expenses for share-based remuneration amounted to € 8,176k (prior year: € 12,427k).\n\n## **Taxes**\n\nUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.\n\nThe Group forms liabilities, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates. The amount of these liabilities is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective Group company's domicile. The carrying value of income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 87,996k (prior year: € 52,723k) and mainly related to current taxes of the fiscal year.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n## **Trade accounts receivable and contract assets**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are carried in the balance sheet less impairment charges made. Allowances for doubtful claims are made on the basis of expected credit losses by means of regular reviews as well as valuations conducted as part of credit monitoring. Assumptions concerning the payment behavior and creditworthiness of customers are subject to significant uncertainties. The carrying value of trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 545,935k (prior year: €460,228k). The carrying value of contract assets as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 882,733k (prior year: €865,085k).\n\n## **Inventories**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value comprises the estimated sales proceeds less the necessary expected costs up to the time of sale. Measurement is also based in part on writedowns for inventories. The size of such writedowns represents a best-possible estimation of net realizable value and is thus subject to uncertainties. The carrying amounts of inventories as of the reporting date amounted to € 178,083k (prior year: € 120,561k). Please refer to Note 21 for further details.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, and intangible assets are valued at cost on initial recognition. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with limited useful lives are depreciated over their expected economic useful lives using the straight-line method. Expected useful lives are based on historical experience and thus subject to significant uncertainties, especially with regard to unforeseen technological developments. When determining the timing of capitalization and the start of amortization for the 5G spectrum, discretionary decisions were made.\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with limited useful lives amounted to € 3,491,424k as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 3,306,074k). This amount includes spectrum licenses of € 1,028,921k (prior year: € 1,069,740k).\n\n## **Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities**\n\n \n\nFor the duration of the lease, a right-of-use asset in the amount of the present value of the future lease payments plus initial direct costs, advance payments, and restoration costs, and less incentive payments received is capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease. At the same time, a lease liability is recognized in the amount of the future lease payments less the interest portion.\n\nThe leases for the business premises in Montabaur and Karlsruhe contain extension options. In order to determine the terms of these leases, a period until 2033 was assumed due to their strategic importance for the Group – with the exception of two leases for buildings in Karlsruhe that were newly occupied in 2020 and have assumed terms until 2035. For leases of office buildings at the other locations, extension options are predominantly not included in the determination of the terms, as these assets could be replaced by the Group without significant cost.\n\nThe leases for antenna locations in connection with the 1&1 mobile communications network usually have a non-cancelable basic lease term of twenty years. Extension options are not included in the term, as it cannot be assumed with sufficient certainty that the extension options will be exercised at the time the lease is concluded.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is used to measure right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of reference interest rates for a period of up to 25 years from risk-free interest rates with appropriate maturities, plus credit risk premiums.\n\n## **Accounting for business combinations**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The initial recognition of goodwill results from the excess of the acquisition cost of the entity over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Costs accrued in the course of the business combination are recognized under other operating expense.\n\nHowever, assumptions made to determine the respective fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition are subject to significant uncertainties. For the identification of intangible assets, depending on the type of intangible asset and complexity of determining its fair value, the Company either uses independent appraisals of external assessors or fair value is determined internally using a suitable assessment technique for the respective intangible asset, generally based on a forecast of to\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\ntal expected future cash flow generation. These valuations are closely related to assumptions and estimates which management has made about the future development of the respective assets and the applicable discounted interest rate.\n\n## **Accruals**\n\nAccruals are formed if the Group has a legal or actual obligation resulting from a past event which will probably give rise to the outflow of resources with an economic benefit to fulfill the obligation, provided that the level of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties. The carrying value of accruals as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 95,099k (prior year: € 72,173k).\n\n# 4. Business combinations and investments\n\n## **4.1 Business combinations in the fiscal year**\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no business combinations in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n## **4.2 Business combinations**\n\n#### **IPO of IONOS**\n\nIn addition to the Group's operating business, there were further intensive preparations for the IPO of IONOS Group SE in early 2023. Concrete plans for the IONOS IPO were announced on January 17, 2023 as part of an \"intention to float\" (ITF) and the IPO was completed on February 8, 2023.\n\nThe shares of IONOS Group SE have since been listed on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) under ISIN: DE000A3E00M1, WKN: A3E00M, ticker symbol: IOS.\n\nUnited Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292m from the sale of shares, while the entire placement volume amounted to around € 389m.\n\nFollowing the IPO of IONOS Group SE, United Internet holds 63.8% and Warburg Pincus 21.2% of IONOS shares. 15.0% of shares are in free float.\n\n#### **Acquisition of shares in Street Media GmbH**\n\nOn September 5, 2023, the Group acquired 28.7% of shares in Street Media GmbH, based in Berlin, which has since been included in the consolidated financial statements as an associated company using the equity method.\n\nAn additional contribution of € 1,490k was made to the equity of Street Media GmbH on October 2, 2023, whereby the shareholding ratio did not change as a result of this transaction. The total acquisition costs for the share purchase amounted to € 1,567k. Street Media GmbH specializes in the development and management of digital media projects.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Explanations of items in the income statement\n\n# 5. Sales/segment reporting\n\n \n\nAccording to IFRS 8, the identification of operating segments to be included in the reporting process is based on the so-called management approach. External reporting should therefore be based on the Group's internal organization and management structure, as well as internal financial reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. In the United Internet Group, the Management Board is responsible for assessing and controlling the success of the various segments.\n\nThe Group's operating business is divided into the two business divisions \"Access\" and \"Applications\", which in turn are divided into the reporting segments \"Consumer Access\" and \"Business Access\", as well as \"Consumer Applications\" and \"Business Applications\".\n\nA description of the products and services is provided in Note 2.1 in the explanation of revenue recognition. The segment \"Corporate\" comprises mainly management holding functions.\n\nThe Management Board of United Internet AG mainly controls operations on the basis of key performance figures. It measures segment success primarily on the basis of sales revenue, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Transactions between segments are charged at market prices. Information on sales revenue is allocated to the country in which the company is domiciled. Segment earnings are reconciled with the total amount for the United Internet Group.\n\nIn the course of preparing the Interim Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023, the Management Board decided to make a significant adjustment to its internal reporting system. As a consequence, this change also led to a revision of segment reporting with a shift in focus from the previous \"controlling view\" to the \"accounting view\". This decision was intended to strengthen the harmonization of the Company's internal controlling and external reporting. The change resulted in reconciliation effects/shifts in key sales and earnings figures among the segments.\n\n- Reconciliation effects on sales: certain intercompany sales are no longer consolidated at segment level (as previously in the controlling view), but only at Group level (accounting view).\n- Reconciliation effects on EBITDA and EBIT: depreciation allocations and profit margins for intercompany services are no longer \"netted\" between segments (as was previously the case for internal service charging in the controlling view) but are disclosed (accounting view) – as if \"booked\" at segment level.\n\nOverall, the change has no effect on the Group's sales and earnings figures.\n\nBy making this change at segment level, United Internet is also taking account of the increasing independence of its segments (subgroups) and aligning segment reporting with the reporting of its listed and thus also reportable subgroups 1&1 AG (Consumer Access segment) and IONOS Group SE (Business Applications segment).\n\nSegment reporting of United Internet AG in fiscal year 2023 was as follows:\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                             | Segment<br>Consumer<br>Access | Segment<br>Business<br>Access | Segment<br>Consumer<br>Applications | Segment<br>Business<br>Applications | Corporate | Reconciliati<br>on/Consolid<br>ation | United<br>Internet<br>Group |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| January -

Revenue of the Business Access segment from contracts with customers for the fiscal year 2023 includes hardware sales of € 16,364k (prior year: € 7,625k). The remaining revenue of the two segments is attributable to service revenue. The other business segments only generate revenue from services.\n\nIn the reporting periods, there was no significant concentration of individual customers in the customer profile. As in the previous year, the United Internet Group did not generate more than 10% of total external sales revenue with any single customer. Foreign sales accounted for 10.6% (prior year: 10.6%) of total Group revenue.\n\nIn addition to investments, the highest management committee only monitors shares in associated companies, other non-current financial assets, and goodwill. The depreciation disclosed in the segments refers to other, non-monitored intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, as these are largely determined automatically once the relevant useful life has been determined.\n\nContract balances developed as follows in the fiscal year 2023:\n\n| in €k                               | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Trade accounts receivable (Note 19) | 543,696       | 460,228       |\n| Contract assets (Note 20)           | 882,733       | 865,085       |\n| Contract liabilities (Note 32)      | 207,691       | 188,383       |\n\nApart from customer growth, the main reason for the year-on-year increase in contract assets was the increased subsidizing of hardware in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, revenue of € 157,093k (prior year: € 157,886k) was recognized which was contained in contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\nThe total transaction price of performance obligations still unfulfilled at the end of the reporting period amounted to € 1,915,122k (prior year: € 1,670,738k) as of December 31, 2023. The following table shows the time bands in which the transaction prices from unfulfilled or partially unfulfilled performance obligations as of the reporting date are expected to be recognized:\n\n| in €k                 | Total     | 2024      | 2025    | >2025   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Consumer Access       | 1,553,503 | 1,140,640 | 412,862 | 0       |\n| Business Access       | 344,767   | 155,048   | 84,816  | 104,902 |\n| Consumer Applications | 9,651     | 8,406     | 1,246   | 0       |\n| Business Applications | 7,201     | 2,742     | 1,858   | 2,602   |\n| Total                 | 1,915,122 | 1,306,836 | 500,783 | 107,504 |\n\nThe transaction prices shown relate to unfulfilled performance obligations from contracts with customers with an original contract term of more than 12 months. They relate to service components with period-based revenue recognition and to contracts for which a one-off fee has been invoiced and which are now recognized as revenue over the relevant original minimum contract term.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.

For further details, please refer to Note 11.\n\nThe other cost of sales mainly include operating costs for the data centers and logistics expenses.\n\n# 7.

The rise in personnel expenses is due to the increase in headcount as well as higher salary adjustments. Personnel expenses in connection with employee stock ownership plans totaled € 8,176k (prior year: € 11,276k).\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of employees increased by 4.7%, from 10,474 employees in the previous year to 10,962 employees at year-end:\n\n|                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany                 | 8,981  | 8,550  |\n| Outside Germany         | 1,981  | 1,924  |\n| thereof the Philippines | 464    | 468    |\n| thereof Spain           | 446    | 422    |\n| thereof Poland          | 339    | 352    |\n| thereof UK              | 273    | 246    |\n| thereof Romania         | 261    | 242    |\n| thereof USA             | 118    | 120    |\n| thereof Austria         | 72     | 67     |\n| thereof France          | 8      | 7      |\n| Total                   | 10,962 | 10,474 |\n| thereof male            | 67%    | 68%    |\n| thereof female          | 33%    | 32%    |\n\nThe average number of employees in fiscal year 2023 amounted to 10,717 (prior year: 10,231), of which 8,755 (prior year: 8,356) were employed in Germany and 1,962 abroad (prior year: 1,875).\n\nWith regard to company pension plans, the Group only has defined contribution plans. The Company pays contributions to the state pension fund as a result of statutory obligations. There are no other benefit obligations for the Company after payment of the contributions. The current contribution payments are disclosed as an expense in the respective year. In fiscal year 2023, they totaled € 45,150k (prior year: € 41,623k) and mostly concerned contributions paid to the state pension fund in Germany.\n\nAs a result of contribution exemptions, an amount of € 0k (prior year: € 0k) of this total referred to contributions paid to related parties.\n\n# 13. Financial expenses\n\n \n\n| €k                                                      | 2023    | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Loans and overdraft facilities                          | 65,600  | 18,659 |\n| Subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives            | 47,918  | 30,096 |\n| Financing costs from leases                             | 21,347  | 11,907 |\n| Interest expense from deferral of frequency liabilities | 6,050   | 6,473  |\n| Interest expense from tax audit                         | 1,090   | 1,399  |\n| Other                                                   | 1,085   | 728    |\n| Total financial expenses                                | 143,091 | 69,262 |\n\nThe subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives relates to the measurement through profit or loss of the derivatives agreed in the course of the Warburg Pincus investment in the Business Applications segment, whose valuation depends in particular on the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. Expenses from subsequent valuation mainly relate to the decline in the fair value of these derivatives as at the end of the reporting period. The sharp decline in derivatives results from the decline in the valuation of the IONOS Group, which was based on its stock market price. This valuation is below the previously recognized enterprise value, which was determined on the basis of valuation reports.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe interest expense from the deferral of spectrum liabilities results from the agreement with the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Network Infrastructure under which the payment obligation for mobile communications spectrum was extended to 2030. Please refer to Note 34,3 for further details.\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 for an explanation of the financial expense from leases.\n\n## 14. Financial income\n\n| €k                                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives | 42,860 | 22,732 |\n| Interest Income from leases                  | 627    | 632    |\n| Income from loans to associated companies    | 467    | 328    |\n| Interest income from tax audit               | 417    | 5,452  |\n| Other financial income                       | 529    | 1,931  |\n| Total financial income                       | 44,899 | 31,074 |\n\nThe subsequent valuation of embedded derivatives refers to the measurement through profit or loss of derivatives agreed in the course of the Warburg Pincus investment in the Business Applications segment. Income from subsequent valuation mainly relates to the decrease in the conditional purchase price liabilities from Strato. For further information, please refer to Note 34.1.\n\nOther financial income mainly comprises interest income from credit balances with banks. With regard to income from loans to associated companies, please refer to Note 41.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 15. Income taxes\n\n \n\nThe income tax expense is comprised as follows:\n\n| €k                                    | 2023     | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Current income taxes                  |          |          |\n| - Germany                             | -259,213 | -249,553 |\n| - Outside Germany                     | -16,717  | -13,597  |\n| Total (current period)                | -275,930 | -263,150 |\n| Deferred taxes                        |          |          |\n| - Due to tax loss carryforwards       | -577     | 3,088    |\n| - due to tax interest carryforwards   |          |          |\n|                                       | 30,697   | 16,150   |\n| - Tax effect on temporary differences | 9,119    | 576      |\n| - Due to tax rate changes             | 1,297    | -3,422   |\n| Total deferred taxes                  | 40,536   | 16,392   |\n| Total tax expense                     | -235,394 | -246,758 |\n\nUnder German tax law, income taxes comprise corporate income tax and trade tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge.\n\nThe effective trade tax rate depends on the municipalities in which the Group operates. The average trade tax rate in fiscal year 2023 amounted to approx. 15.60% (prior year: 15.64%).\n\nAs in the previous year, German corporate income tax was levied at 15% – irrespective of whether the result was retained or distributed. In addition, a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% is imposed on the assessed corporate income tax.\n\nIn addition to taxes on the current result, current income taxes include non-period tax expenses of € 4,579k (prior year: tax income of € 4,824k).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for tax loss carryforwards, interest carryforwards, and temporary differences if it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards in certain countries are shown in the table below:\n\n| €k             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Germany        | 86,035 | 87,076 |\n| United Kingdom | 464    | 0      |\n|                | 86,499 | 87,076 |\n\nDeferred taxes for loss carryforwards mainly relate to the 1&1 Versatel Group. Taking into consideration significant taxable temporary differences, the realization of loss carryforwards is based in particular on the strategic importance of Versatel as an intercompany service provider for the existing Layer II products of 1&1 Telecom GmbH, as well as on significant positive earnings forecasts and the planned provision of the backbone network for the establishment of the 5G mobile communications network of 1&1 AG.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following time limits apply for the use of tax loss carryforwards in different countries:\n\n- USA: 20 years for loss carryforwards incurred before 2018, indefinite for loss carryforwards incurred from 2018 onwards\n- Germany: Indefinite, but minimum taxation\n\nTax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been formed, refer to the following countries (excluding Germany):\n\n| €k            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| USA Federal * | 27,474 | 27,307 |\n| USA State **  | 620    | 349    |\n|               | 28,094 | 27,656 |\n\n\\* Tax rate 21.0%\n\n\\*\\* Tax rate 10.0%\n\nA breakdown of income tax types results in the following loss carryforwards for Germany for which no deferred taxes have been formed:\n\n|         | 2023            |           | 2022            |           |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| €k      | Corporation tax | Trade tax | Corporation tax | Trade tax |\n| Germany | 215,941         | 89,014    | 106,250         | 25,093    |\n\nLoss carryforwards in Germany for which no deferred tax assets have been formed mainly refer to loss carryforwards of 1&1 Versatel GmbH, 1&1 Energy GmbH, and IONOS Group SE (formerly: IONOS TopCo SE).\n\nThe so-called \"interest cap\" enshrined in German tax law limits the deductibility of interest expenses for the assessment of company income taxes. Interest expenses that cannot therefore be deducted are carried forward indefinitely to the following fiscal years (interest carryforward).\n\nThe Group's interest carryforward, for which no deferred taxes were formed, amounts to € 0k (prior year: € 89,648k).\n\nIn the reporting period, additional deferred tax assets were recognized on interest carryforwards due to the positive planning of tax results. The resulting tax relief amounted to € 30,697k in the financial period (prior year: € 16,150k). Deferred tax receivables on interest carryforwards from previous years account for € 24,320k of this total.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, no interest and loss carryforwards were used (prior year: € 0k) for which deferred taxes had been formed in the previous year.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred taxes resulted from the following items:\n\n \n\n|                                      | 2023         |              | 2022         |              |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                      | Deferred tax | Deferred tax | Deferred tax | Deferred tax |\n| €k                                   | assets       | liabilities  | assets       | liabilities  |\n| Trade accounts receivable            | 1,317        | 10,530       | 1,031        | 7,927        |\n| Inventories                          | 151          | 40           | 155          | 122          |\n| Contract assets - current*           | 0            | 181,583      | 0            | 174,418      |\n| Contract assets - non current        | 0            | 60,640       | 0            | 62,169       |\n| Other financial assets – current     | 570          | 21           | 828          | 1,242        |\n| Other financial assets – non-current | 42           | 526          | 858          | 668          |\n| Other assets                         | 0            | 6,693        | 47           | 9,243        |\n| Prepaid expenses                     | 217,979      | 97,421       | 193,991      | 73,606       |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 1,968        | 20,489       | 2,268        | 19,823       |\n| Right-of-use from leases             | 79           | 248,183      | 131          | 199,587      |\n| Intangible assets                    | 31,154       | 263,058      | 42,339       | 287,731      |\n| Other accrued liabilities            | 43,174       | 7,197        | 51,135       | 8,959        |\n| Contract liabilities                 | 28,330       | 52,748       | 23,529       | 49,141       |\n| Other liabilities                    | 2,924        | 3,869        | 2,586        | 692          |\n| Lease liabilities - current          | 32,749       | 36           | 31,609       | 11           |\n| Lease liabilities - non current      | 222,573      | 9,168        | 168,308      | 2            |\n| Gross value                          | 583,010      | 962,202      | 518,815      | 895,342      |\n| Tax loss carryforwards               | 86,499       | n.a          | 87,076       | n.a          |\n| Tax interest carried forward         | 66,766       | n.a.         | 36,069       | n.a.         |\n| Adjustments for consolidation        | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            |\n| Offsetting                           | -669,183     | -669,183     | -585,671     | -585,671     |\n| Consolidated balance sheet           | 67,092       | 293,020      | 56,289       | 309,671      |\n\n\\* In the fiscal year 2022, adjustments for consolidation were allocated to the individual balance sheet items from which the relevant deferred taxes are derived.\n\nThe net balance of deferred tax liabilities of € 253,383k in the previous year decreased to a net balance of deferred tax liabilities of € 225,928k.

This change was mainly due to the following factors:\n\nDecrease in deferred tax assets from employee stock ownership plans of € 14.9m\n\n- Decrease in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets in connection with the amortization of assets from company acquisitions of € 13.5m\n- Increase in deferred tax assets from interest carryforwards of € 30.7m\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe change in the net balance of deferred taxes compared to the previous year is reconciled as follows:\n\n| €k                                                 | 2023    | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Deferred tax income + / Deferred tax expense -     | 40,536  | 16,392 |\n| Deferred tax effects recognised directly in equity | -13,081 | -4,096 |\n| Change in the net balance of deferred taxes        | 27,455  | 12,296 |\n\nThe deferred tax effects recognized in equity result mainly from the employee stock ownership plans, which are recognized in equity.\n\nThe aggregate tax rate is reconciled to the effective tax rate of continued operations as follows:\n\n| %                                                                                                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Anticipated tax rate                                                                                     | 31.4 | 31.5 |\n| Actual and deferred taxes for previous years                                                             | 0.5  | 0.7  |\n| Non-tax-deductible writedowns on financial assets                                                        | 0.3  | 0.3  |\n| Non-tax-deductible writedowns on intangible assets                                                       | 0.2  | 0.3  |\n| Tax-reduced profit from disposals and income from investments                                            | 1.2  | 0.0  |\n| Tax effects in connection with internal Group dividends and<br>disposals                                 | 0.2  | 0.1  |\n| Differences due to tax rate changes                                                                      | -1.7 | -1.2 |\n| Employee stock ownership programs                                                                        | 0.3  | 0.1  |\n| First-time capitalization of interest carryforwards that can be used in the future                       | -3.9 | -0.7 |\n| Tax effects related to the settlement of intragroup impaired loans                                       | 3.9  | 0.0  |\n| Tax losses and non-deductible interest of the fiscal year for which<br>no deferred taxes were recognized | 2.2  | 1.3  |\n| Non-taxable at-equity results                                                                            | 3.1  | 1.4  |\n| Trade tax additions                                                                                      | 1.5  | 0.6  |\n| Balance of other tax-free income and non-deductible expenses                                             | 0.2  | 0.3  |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                       | 39.4 | 34.7 |\n\nThe item \"Actual and deferred taxes for previous years\" mainly refers to actual tax expenses from the tax audit.\n\nThe item \"Tax-reduced profit from disposals and income from investments\" relates to income resulting from the IPO of IONOS Group SE.\n\nThe item \"Tax effects in connection with internal Group dividends and disposals\" relates to relates to a receivable from affiliated companies in the Business Access segment that was written down in previous years and reversed in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe item \"Non-taxable at-equity results\" mainly relates to the prorated results of the associated companies Kublai GmbH and AWIN AG.\n\nThe anticipated tax rate corresponds to the tax rate of the parent company, United Internet AG.\n\nIn accordance with the amendment to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules, the United Internet Group applies the temporary, mandatory exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of global minimum taxation.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the jurisdictions to be included for Pillar Two purposes, the following have already enacted final implementing legislation: Germany, France, Austria, Romania, and the UK. The following jurisdictions have already published draft legislation for corresponding implementation: Canada and Spain.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis based on the qualified CbCR data of the current and the three previous fiscal years as well as the forecasts for future fiscal years shows that Romania could qualify as a low-tax country for Pillar Two purposes within the United Internet Group once the legislation comes into force. This could result in an annual additional tax burden in the lower five-digit euro range for the Group as a whole from fiscal year 2024 onwards.\n\nAs in the previous year, income tax claims mainly relate to receivables from tax authorities in Germany and amounted to € 34,754k (prior year: € 34,741k) as of the balance sheet date.\n\nAs in the previous year, income tax liabilities relate primarily to liabilities to tax authorities in Germany and amounted to € 87,996k (prior year: € 52,723k) as of the balance sheet date.\n\n# 16. Earnings per share\n\n \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, capital stock was divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares (prior year: 194,000,000 shares) each with a theoretical share in the capital stock of € 1. On December 31, 2023, United Internet held 19,183,705 treasury shares (prior year: 7,284,109). These treasury shares do not entitle the Company to any rights or proportional dividends and are thus deducted from equity. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used for calculating undiluted earnings per share was 172,816,295 for fiscal year 2023 (prior year: 186,715,891).\n\nAs of the reporting date, there was a dilutive effect from employee stock ownership plans of subsidiaries of € 0.02 (prior year: € 0.01) per share.\n\nThe calculation of the dilutive effect from conversion is made by first determining the number of potential shares. On the basis of the average fair value of the shares, the number of shares is then calculated which could be acquired from the total amount of payments (par value of the rights plus additional payment). If the difference between the two values is zero, the total payment is exactly equivalent to the fair value of the potential shares and no dilutive effect need be considered. If the difference is positive, it is assumed that these shares will be issued in the amount of the difference without consideration.\n\nBased on an average market price of € 17.77 (prior year: € 26.44), this would result in the issuance of 2,585,413 shares (prior year: 461,921) without consideration. The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2023 is therefore 175,401,708 (prior year: 187,177,812).\n\nThe following table shows the underlying amounts for the calculation of undiluted and diluted earnings:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n| €k                                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to the shareholders of United Internet AG | 232,716 | 367,196 |\n| Earnings per share (in €)                                     |         |         |\n| - undiluted                                                   | 1.35    | 1.97    |\n| - diluted                                                     | 1.33    | 1.96    |\n| Weighted average of outstanding shares (in million units)     |         |         |\n| - undiluted                                                   | 172.82  | 186.72  |\n| - diluted                                                     | 175.40  | 187.18  |\n\n## 17. Dividend per share\n\nThe ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting of United Internet AG on May 17, 2023 voted to accept the proposal of the Management Board and Supervisory Board to pay a dividend of € 0.50 per share. The total dividend payment of € 86.4m was made on May 22, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with section 21 of the Company's articles, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting decides on the allocation of unappropriated profit. For the fiscal year 2023, the Management Board will propose to the Supervisory Board a dividend of € 0.50 for each share entitled to dividends for the past fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board will discuss this dividend proposal at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 20, 2024.\n\nPursuant to section 71b AktG, the Company does not accrue any rights from treasury shares and thus has no pro-rated dividend rights. As at the date of signing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the United Internet Group holds 19,183,705 treasury shares (prior year: 19,183,705). The number of shares with dividend rights may change before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. In this case, a proposal will be made to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to maintain the dividend of € 0.50 per entitled no-par value share with a corresponding adjustment to the proposal for the appropriation of profit.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Explanations of items in the balance sheet\n\n## 18. Cash and cash equivalents\n\n \n\nAs of the reporting date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 27,689k (prior year: € 40,523k). Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances, checks, and cash in hand. Bank balances generally bear variable interest rates for call money. In the reporting period, United Internet received a low interest on bank balances denominated in euro of approx. 1.75% (prior year: 0%).\n\nThe development and application of cash and cash equivalents is stated in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n\n# 19.

The funds were allocated to the company's free capital reserves (section 272 (2) no. 4 HGB) without increasing the share capital. United Internet AG contributed a total amount of € 602k to the equity of Kublai GmbH.\n\nDue in part to ongoing negotiations regarding the refinancing of Tele Columbus AG and the continued significantly negative operating performance of Tele Columbus AG, the shares held in Kublai GmbH were subjected to an event-driven impairment test in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. United Internet assumed a planning horizon of 17 years to determine their fair value less selling costs. Assuming a discount rate of 4.9%, a growth rate in perpetuity of 1.0%, an EBITDA margin in perpetuity of 35.0% and a capex to sales ratio in perpetuity of 18.0%, there was a carrying amount surplus of € 166.8m as of December 31, 2023 and thus no impairment need was identified for the shares in Kublai GmbH.\n\nAn increase in the discount rate of one percentage point to 5.9% would result in an impairment of € 34.7m. A reduction in the EBITDA margin in perpetuity from 35.0% to 29.0% would also result in an impairment of € 10.5m.\n\nThe following table contains summarized financial information of the main associated companies on the basis of a shareholding of 100% as at December 31, 2022:\n\n| Summarized financial information on the main associated companies: | Kublai GmbH<br>€k | AWIN AG<br>€k |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Current assets                                                     | 196,542           | 549,661       |\n| Non-current assets                                                 | 2,312,828         | 318,578       |\n| Current liabilities                                                | 216,793           | 435,377       |\n| Non-current liabilities                                            | 1,466,141         | 39,720        |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the company                 | 788,337           | 393,191       |\n| Non-controlling interests                                          | 38,099            | 0             |\n| Shareholders' equity                                               | 826,435           | 393,191       |\n| Sales                                                              | 446,634           | 178,473       |\n| Other comprehensive income                                         | 2,338             | -1,134        |\n| Net profit/loss                                                    | -104,759          | 26,262        |\n| Total comprehensive income                                         | -102,421          | 25,128        |\n\n\\* As the full financial information of Kublai GmbH as of December 31, 2023 was not yet available to United Internet at the time of preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the summarized financial information on the carrying amount disclosed in United Internet's Consolidated Balance Sheet was calculated on the basis of the interim financial statements of Kublai GmbH as of September 30, 2022.\n\nA reconciliation with the carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022 – with an estimation of investment results for the fourth quarter – is presented below:\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n| T€                                                    | Kublai GmbH<br>€k | AWIN AG<br>€k |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the company    | 788,337           | 393,191       |\n| Share ratio of United Internet AG                     | 40%               | 20%           |\n| United Internet Group's share in the net asset values | 315,335           | 78,638        |\n| Impairment / impairment reversal effects              | 0                 | 0             |\n| Closing date-related reconciliation effects           | 0                 | 0             |\n| Carrying amount on Dec. 31, 2022                      | 315,335           | 78,638        |\n\n\\* As the full financial information of Kublai GmbH as of December 31, 2023 was not yet available to United Internet at the time of preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the reconciliation to the carrying amount disclosed in United Internet's Consolidated Balance Sheet was calculated on the basis of the interim financial statements of Kublai GmbH as of September 30, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, other associated companies disclosed an aggregated carrying amount of € 34,086k (prior year: € 35,331k) and an aggregated loss of € 3,352k (prior year: € 2,009k).

While the 3.6 GHz spectrum is already available, the frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will only be available from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe intangible assets resulting from the purchase were recognized at cost.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the frequency blocks are comprised as follows:\n\n| €k      | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| 3.6 GHz | 693,924       | 734,743       |\n| 2 GHz   | 334,997       | 334,997       |\n|         | 1,028,921     | 1,069,740     |\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band were amortized by € 40,819k (prior year: € 447k). The acquired frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will not be amortized until actual network operation commences and if these frequency blocks are also available at that time. These spectrum licenses are not yet usable and were therefore subjected to an impairment test in the fiscal year 2023. The impairment test was performed on the balance sheet date on the level of the cash-generating unit 5G. It did not result in any impairment in the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of trademarks according to the cash-generating units:\n\n| €k             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1&1 Versatel   | 62,000        | 62,000        |\n| 1&1            | 53,200        | 53,200        |\n| Mail.com       | 24,679        | 25,606        |\n| Strato         | 20,070        | 20,070        |\n| WEB.DE         | 17,173        | 17,173        |\n| home.pl        | 11,144        | 10,326        |\n| Arsys          | 7,278         | 7,278         |\n| united-domains | 4,198         | 4,198         |\n| Fasthosts      | 3,983         | 3,903         |\n| World4You      | 3,494         | 3,494         |\n| Cronon         | 463           | 463           |\n|                | 207,682       | 207,711       |\n\nThe carrying amounts of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (trademarks) totaled € 207,682k (prior year: € 207,711k).\n\nThe useful life of trademarks is determined as being indefinite, as there are no indications that the flow of benefits will end in future. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were subjected to an impairment test on the level of the cash-generating units as of the reporting date.\n\nThe rights similar to concessions result from a one-off payment in the fiscal year 2020 in connection with the exercise of the first prolongation option of the MBA MVNO agreement in order to secure direct \n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\naccess to 5G technology and as a necessary component for the establishment of the Group's own mobile communications network.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets relate to capitalized costs from software.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, there were purchase commitments for intangible assets amounting to € 68.0m (prior year: € 143.9m).\n\nThe increase in payments on account mainly relates to software for operating the 1&1 mobile communications network.\n\n## 28.

The Group's goodwill is mainly the result of the following company acquisitions:\n\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit we22 results from the acquisition of we22 AG in 2021 and has been part of the cash-generating unit IONOS SE since the fiscal year 2022.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit World4You results from the acquisition of World4You in in 2018.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access (formerly Drillisch) results from the acquisition of the Drillisch Group in 2017 and the merger of the cash-generating units 1&1 Telecom and Drillisch in 2018.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit IONOS Cloud (formerly: ProfitBricks) results from the acquisition of the ProfitBricks Group in 2017. Due to the merger in fiscal year 2019, the cash-generating unit IONOS Cloud has been incorporated into the cash-generating unit IONOS SE.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating units Versatel and 1&1 Telecom reflect goodwill from the acquisition of the Versatel Group in 2014. In the fiscal year 2018, goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Telecom was combined with the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit STRATO results from the acquisition of the STRATO Group in 2017.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit home.pl results from the acquisition of home.pl S.A. in 2015.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit Arsys results from the acquisition of Arsys Internet S.L. in 2013.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit united-domains results from the acquisition of united-domains AG in 2008.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit Fasthosts results from the acquisition of Fasthosts Internet Ltd. in 2006 and the acquisition of Dollamore Ltd. in 2008.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit InterNetX results from the acquisition of InterNetX GmbH in 2005.\n- The goodwill of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Mail & Media mainly comprises goodwill from the acquisition of the portal business of WEB.DE AG in 2005.\n\n## **Scheduled impairment test on December 31, 2023**\n\n## **Measurement at fair value less disposal costs**\n\nFor the Business Access, Consumer Applications, and Business Applications segments, the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined on the basis of a calculation of fair value less disposal costs using cash flow forecasts. The hierarchy of fair value less disposal costs as defined by IFRS 13 is set at Level 3 for these impairment tests.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are based on the Company's budgets for the fiscal year 2024. These planning calculations were extrapolated by management for a period of up to 10 years (prior year: up to 10 years) for the respective cash-generating units on the basis of external market studies and internal assumptions. Following this period, management assumes the following increase in cash flow:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 1.00%         | 0.50%         |\n| Consumer Applications | 1.00%         | 1.00%         |\n| Business Applications | 1.0% - 2.2%   | 1.0% - 2.4%   |\n\nThe expected increase corresponds to long-term average growth of the sector in which the respective cash-generating unit operates.\n\nThe following discount rates were used for cash flow forecasts in the reporting period:\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 4.9%          | 3.9%          |\n| Consumer Applications | 7.8%          | 7.0%          |\n| Business Applications | 7.5% - 9.7%   | 6.9% - 9.5%   |\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend heavily on the estimation of future sales revenue. The management boards of the respective cash-generating units expect a varied development of sales within the planning horizon.\n\nSales revenue figures in the detailed planning period are based on the following average annual sales growth rates:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 5.0%          | 3.4%          |\n| Consumer Applications | 6.3%          | 7.0%          |\n| Business Applications | 4.5% - 9.9%   | 4.4% - 8.0%   |\n\nFair value less disposal costs is mainly based on the present value of the perpetual annuity, which is particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions on the long-term growth rate and the discount rate. For the calculation of fair value less disposal costs, disposal cost rates of between 0.4% and 3.0% were assumed (prior year: between 0.2% and 3.0%).\n\nThe business segments contain the following trademarks:\n\n|                       | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Business Access       | 62,000        | 62,000        |\n| Consumer Applications | 41,852        | 42,779        |\n| Business Applications | 50,630        | 49,732        |\n\n## **Measurement at value-in-use**\n\n \n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access is determined on the basis of a calculation of the value-in-use with the aid of cash flow forecasts.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are based on a Group budget for the fiscal year 2024 as well as a planning calculation for the fiscal years 2025 to 2029. These planning calculations were extrapolated by management on the basis of external market studies and internal assumptions for the cash-generating unit. As it is expected that a sustainable level of sales and earnings will not yet have been achieved by the end of the detailed planning period (2029), it has been extended to include an interim phase for the years 2029 to 2040 inclusive until a sustainable level of sales and earnings is to be achieved.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend heavily on the estimation of future sales revenue. Another key basic assumption for the planning of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access is the number of subscribers, the gross profit forecast based on these subscriber numbers and on empirical values, and the discount rates applied. For future years, the number of subscribers is expected to increase and the gross profit to decrease slightly.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nValue-in-use is largely determined by the present value of the perpetual annuity, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions regarding the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.\n\nThe following parameters were used for measurement:\n\n|                                             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Increase in cash flow for perpetual annuity | 1.0%          | 0.5%          |\n| Discount rate before taxes                  | 10.30%        | 8.80%         |\n| Discount rates after taxes                  | 6.4%          | 5.7%          |\n| Annual growth rates                         | 1.7%          | 1.2%          |\n| Carrying amount of trademark rights         | 53,200        | 53,200        |\n\nThis growth rate corresponds to the long-term average growth rate for the sector.\n\n## **Basic assumptions of the impairment tests**\n\nThe following table presents the basic assumptions used when checking impairment of individual cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated, in order to determine their fair value less disposal costs, or in the case of the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access the value-in-use:\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n|

respect to the impairment of goodwill or trademarks depends on the respective cash-generating units.\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the cash-generating unit World4You, an increase in the discount rate (after taxes) of 1.3 percentage points and a decline in the EBITDA margin of 4.8 percentage points was assumed at the same time. These assumptions would result in impairment of € 2.2m. Without an increase in the discount rate and a simultaneous decrease in the EBITDA margin, the headroom amounts to €8m. Based on current knowledge, management does not expect any significant deviations in the EBITDA margin. Assumptions on the possible development of the cost of capital rate are based on the further interest rate increases of the fiscal year 2023. Possible opportunities from the possibilities of price adjustments as a result of increased operating costs are not taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the other cash-generating units, the discount rates (after taxes) were also increased by the year-on-year change and at the same time a CGU-specific appropriate decrease in the long-term growth rate in perpetuity and alternatively a decrease in the EBITDA margin in perpetuity were assumed. These assumptions would not result in any changes to the impairment tests for these cash-generating units.\n\n## **Spectrum**\n\nThe 5G spectrum carried in the balance sheet results from the 5G spectrum auction in 2019. 1&1 purchased two frequency blocks of 2 x 5 MHz in the 2 GHz band and five frequency blocks of 10 MHz in the 3.6 GHz band, which are each usable for a limited period up to December 31, 2040. The frequency blocks in the 3.6 GHz band have been available since acquisition and the frequency blocks in the 2 GHz band will be available from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 5G is determined by calculating value-in-use with the aid of cash flow forecasts.\n\nThe planning calculation on which the impairment test is based includes income statement planning and capital expenditure planning for the fiscal years 2024 to 2040. As the spectrum runs until 2040, the test was conducted for the period 2024 to 2040. Due to the innovation cycle in the telecommunications industry, no perpetuity was applied.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts depend to a large extent on the estimate of future revenue, the assumptions regarding investments in the network infrastructure, and the ongoing operating costs of network operations. The main revenue drivers for the cash-generating unit 5G are growth in the number of 1&1 network subscribers and planning for the future data consumption of customers. The planning calculations were based on subscriber growth in the cash-generating unit 1&1 Consumer Access, while assumptions regarding future customer data consumption are based on empirical values. Planning for investments in the network infrastructure are based on specific rollout plans, which are mainly based on the rollout obligations arising from the spectrum acquisition and the contractually agreed rollout costs. Planning for the ongoing costs of network operation are based on agreements already concluded and assumptions about the development of energy costs based on experience. A further key basic assumption for the planning of the cash-generating unit is the discount rates used.\n\nThe following parameters were used for measurement:\n\n| Radio spectrum             | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Discount rate before taxes | 6.0%          | 5.1%          |\n| Discount rates after taxes | 4.5%          | 3.9%          |\n\nThere was no impairment need in the reporting period. This also reflects the Management Board's qualitative expectations due to the high degree of strategic importance.\n\n## **Sensitivity of assumptions**\n\nThe sensitivity of the assumptions made with respect to an impairment of the intangible asset not yet available for use (spectrum) depends on the basic assumptions for the cash-generating unit.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of analyzing sensitivity for the cash-generating unit 1&1 mobile telecommunications network, an increase in the discount rate of 1.0 percentage point and a rise of 5 percent in operating costs for active network technology (in particular energy costs) was assumed. These assumptions would result in impairment of approx. € 261m. Based on current knowledge, management does not expect any significant deviations in the planned costs for passive infrastructure and network rollout costs due to the contractual constellations with the network rollout partners.

The proceeds from this transaction are used for general company funding. There are no covenants attached to the new promissory note loan.\n\nMoreover, two promissory note loan tranches totaling € 238.0m were redeemed on schedule in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, total liabilities from the promissory note loans 2017, 2021, and 2023 with maximum terms until May 2030 therefore amounted to € 1,162.0m (prior year: € 1,100.0m).\n\n#### **Syndicated loans & syndicated loan facilities**\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a banking syndicate granted United Internet AG a revolving syndicated loan facility totaling € 810m until January 2025. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made use of a contractually agreed prolongation option and extended the term of the revolving syndicated loan facility for the period from January 2025 to January 2026. A credit facility of € 690m was agreed for this prolongation period.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date on December 31, 2023, € 150m of the revolving syndicated loan facility had been drawn (prior year: € 550m). As a result, funds of € 660m (prior year: € 260m) were still available to be drawn from the credit facility as at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn addition to the € 150m, the disclosed loan liability of € 950m also includes the loan of € 800m concluded by IONOS Group with a banking syndicate in December 2023. This loan was used fully for the partial refinancing of the existing shareholder loan with United Internet AG. The refinancing is at a fixed annual interest rate of 4.67%. The syndicated loan has a term until December 15, 2026 and is due at maturity.\n\n#### **Bilateral credit agreements / bilateral credit facilities**\n\nThe Company also has bilateral credit agreements with several banks totaling € 50m (prior year: € 200m). The term expires at the latest on August 12, 2024. As at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023, these bilateral credit agreements were used in full (as in the previous year).\n\nIn addition, various bilateral credit facilities amounting to € 475m (prior year: € 400m) are available to the Company. These have been granted in part until further notice and in part have terms until March 31, 2025. Drawings of € 295m (prior year: € 300m) had been made from these credit facilities as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\nUnited Internet therefore had free credit lines from syndicated loan facilities and bilateral credit agreements totaling € 840m (prior year: € 360m) as at the end of the reporting period on December 31, 2023.\n\n| €k                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Credit lines granted   | 475,000 | 400,000 |\n| Credit lines utilized  | 294,800 | 300,000 |\n| Available credit lines | 180,200 | 100,000 |\n| Average interest rate  | 4.89    | 2.58    |\n\n**Credit lines granted (without the revolving syndicated loan facility)** \n\nNo collateral was provided for any of the liabilities due to banks.\n\nWith the exception of the interest-bearing tranches of the promissory note loan, the fair values of bank liabilities mainly correspond to their carrying amounts. For further information on the promissory note loan, please refer to Note 41.\n\nA euro cash pooling agreement (zero balancing) has been in place between United Internet AG and certain subsidiaries since July 2012. Under the agreement, credit and debit balances of the participating\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup subsidiaries are pooled and netted via several cascades in a central bank account of United Internet AG and available each banking day.\n\n#### **b) Guaranty credit facilities**\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned credit lines, the Group had guaranty credit facilities of € 105.0m (prior year: € 105.0m) as at the end of the reporting period, which in some cases can also be used by other Group companies. The guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees.\n\n#### **Guaranty credit facilities**\n\n \n\n| €k                       | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranty lines granted   | 105,000 | 105,000 |\n| Guaranty lines utilized  | 25,594  | 28,279  |\n| Available guaranty lines | 79,406  | 76,721  |\n| Average interest rate    | 0.40%   | 0.40%   |\n\nThe guaranty credit facilities are available in particular for the provision of operational bank guarantees. The guaranty credit facilities granted are mostly for unlimited periods (\"until further notice\"). One agreement is limited until December 30, 2024. No collateral was provided to banks.\n\nThe stated average interest rate as of the reporting date is based on utilization.\n\n# 32.

Where applicable, the reversal was offset against non-current assets directly in equity.\n\nOther accruals refer mainly to accruals for warranties and impending losses.\n\n## 34.

The decrease in contingent purchase price liabilities results on the one hand from the decrease in the valuation of the IONOS Group based on its stock market price. This valuation is the basis for measuring the variable purchase price components from the acquisition of STRATO AG. On the other hand, the contingent purchase price liability from the acquisition of Profit Bricks GmbH was settled in the fiscal year.\n\n## **34.2 Other current non-financial liabilities**\n\n| €k                                      | 2023    | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Other current non-financial liabilities |         |        |\n| - Liabilities to the tax office         | 112,715 | 52,432 |\n| - Other                                 | 16,919  | 16,524 |\n| Total                                   | 129,635 | 68,956 |\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nLiabilities to the tax office mainly refer to sales tax liabilities. The year-on-year increase results from a change in sales tax grouping as a result of the transfer of the 1&1 AG Group to United Internet AG and the resulting lower advance payment. The resulting sales tax will be paid to the tax authorities after the end of the advance return period.\n\n## **34.3 Other non-current financial liabilities**\n\n \n\n| €k                                          | 2023      | 2022      |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other non-current non-financial liabilities |           |           |\n| - Spectrum liabilities                      | 702,592   | 763,858   |\n| - Leasing liabilities                       | 667,836   | 537,210   |\n| - Other loans                               | 8,149     | 8,150     |\n| - Other                                     | 9,733     | 4,095     |\n| Total                                       | 1,388,310 | 1,313,313 |\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 regarding liabilities from lease commitments.\n\nSpectrum liabilities refer to the licenses acquired at auction in the fiscal year 2019. In 2019, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG signed an agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) and the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) regarding the construction of mobile communication sites in so-called \"not-spots\". 1&1 AG is thus helping to close existing supply gaps and improve the provision of mobile communications in rural regions by building base stations. In return, 1&1 AG benefits from an agreement allowing it to pay for the acquired 5G spectrum in installments.

Share-based payment – employee stock ownership plans\n\nThere were five different employee stock ownership plans in the reporting period 2022. One model with so-called Stock Appreciation Rights model United Internet (SAR UI) is aimed at the group of management board members, senior executives and managers and based on virtual stock options of United Internet AG. The second plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan Hosting (LTIP Hosting) was introduced in the second half of 2017 and is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and other employees in key positions in the Business Applications segment. The third plan, the Long Term Incentive Plan Versatel (LTIP Versatel) was introduced in the first half of 2018 and is aimed at the group of managing directors, executives and employees in key positions in the Business Access segment. The fourth plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch) was introduced in the first half of 2020, is also aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions in the Consumer Access segment and replaced in part the former SAR plan of Drillisch in 2020. The fifth plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan Portal (LTIP Portal) was introduced in the first half of 2019 and is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions in the Consumer Applications segment. The sixth program, the Stock Appreciation Rights IONOS (SAR IONOS), was introduced in the course of the IPO of IONOS in the first quarter of 2023 and is aimed at management board members of IONOS Group SE. Moreover, the existing LTIP Hosting agreements were modified in this connection.\n\n## **36.1 Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR United Internet)**\n\nUnited Internet AG has had a Stock Appreciation Rights plan (SAR plan) since 2009. SARs refer to the commitment of United Internet AG (or a subsidiary) to pay the beneficiary a cash amount equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting the option (agreed strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 120% of the strike price, which is calculated as the average closing price in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. In the case of the current tranches, the beneficiaries were in some cases awarded a maximum strike price of € 30 per SAR. Payment of value growth to the beneficiary is limited – depending on the arrangements of the different tranches – to a) 100% of the calculated share price (strike price), or b) to a fixed euro amount.\n\nIn 2023, the plan conditions were amended for one participant. In return for the amendment to the plan condition, a one-off payment was granted. The associated expense was recognized in full in 2023. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to determine this expense.\n\nIn connection with the appointment to the UI Management Board, the existing share-based remuneration of a beneficiary under the LTIP Portal plan was converted to an SAR United Internet commitment, whilst taking into account the beneficiary's service period. After consideration of the assumptions made on the modification date, no additional expenses are to be recognized. The expenses from the commitment are recognized by United Internet AG from the date of the change.\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of United Internet AG. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of United Internet AG. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the Company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, United Internet AG retains the right to fulfill its commitment (or the commitment of a subsidiary) to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring United Internet AG shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. The program is thus recognized as an equity-settled plan.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a rule, up to 25% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 24 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 50% at the earliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option. A total of up to 75% may be exercised at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; the full amount may be exercised at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. For one issue, however, exercise is possible after 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Beyond this, no further conditions have to be met for the SARs to be successfully awarded.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (for one beneficiary using the Black-Scholes model and for another beneficiary using the Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\n| Issue date                      |         | Oct. 1, 2020 |         | Apr. 01, 2023 |\n|---------------------------------|---------|--------------|---------|---------------|\n| Volume                          | 175,000 | SARs         | 300,000 | €             |\n| Average market value per option | 22.55   | €            | 7.06    | €             |\n| Strike price                    | 30.00   | €            | 16.91   | €             |\n| Share price                     | 32.47   | €            | 15.80   | €             |\n| Dividend yield                  | 1.5     | %            | 2.90    | %             |\n| Volatility of the share         | 48.20   | %            | 30.80   | %             |\n| Expected term (years)           | 5       |              | 4       |               |\n| Risk-free interest rate         | 0       | %            | 2.70    | %             |\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model / Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the options issued were calculated using the following material measurement parameters:\n\nThe limited payout per SAR was reflected by deducting the value of an option valuation at twice the strike price. With regard to the exercise windows of the SARs, the Black-Scholes valuation assumed the earliest possible exercise. The Monte Carlo simulation also assumed the earliest possible exercise. Irrespective of the selected valuation method, the respective exercise hurdles were also taken into account when exercising the option.\n\nAs the SARs have no dividend entitlement, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of United Internet AG as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated as a weighted average on the basis of the historical volatility for the last 6 (1/3 weighting) and 12 months (2/3 weighting) prior to the measurement date, respectively. The strike price is calculated on the basis of the average share price of the last 10 days prior to the issuance date.\n\nThe SAR United Internet plan has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 39,222 | 41,469 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 38,075 | 39,227 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 1,147  | 2,242  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | -1,152 | 2,361  |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                    | SAR      | Average strike price (€) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2021                                | 577,500  | 35.61                    |\n| expired / forfeited                                                | -90,000  | 30.00                    |\n| new emission                                                       | -37,500  | 41.26                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022                                | 450,000  | 32.50                    |\n| expired / forfeited                                                | -275,000 | 34.09                    |\n| new emission                                                       | 300,000  | 16.91                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023                                | 475,000  | 21.73                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023                                | 0        | n/a                      |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022                                | 0        | n/a                      |\n| Weighted average remaining term as at 31 December 2023 (in months) | 26       |                          |\n| Weighted average remaining term as at 31 December 2022 (in months) | 35       |                          |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\nThe range of strike prices for stock options outstanding at the end of the reporting period is between € 16.91 and € 30.00 (prior year: € 31.26 and € 44.06).\n\n## **36.2 Long-Term Incentive Plan Business Applications (LTIP Hosting) and Long-Term Incentive Plan WE22**\n\n#### **Long-Term Incentive Plan Business Applications (LTIP Hosting)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) was introduced for the Business Applications segment (IONOS Group) in the fiscal year 2017. The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of management (management board members and senior executives), as well as other key employees of the IONOS Group (Business Applications segment), with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the parent company (IONOS Group SE) and other companies of the IONOS Group.\n\nWithin the LTIP plan, qualifying employees in the Hosting division are awarded so-called Management Incentive Plan (MIP) units (stock appreciation rights). Vesting is on a straight-line basis (beginning with the date of issue) and on condition that the employee concerned has not resigned before the occurrence of an event defined in the LTIP agreement (trigger event). This refers to the complete sale of all shares in IONOS Group SE held by Warburg Pincus.\n\nThe partial sale of shares by Warburg Pincus does not constitute such a trigger event – neither in 2021 nor in 2023.\n\nIn the event of a trigger event, the MIP units represent a claim equivalent to the difference between the individually determined strike price and the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. The strike price is increased or decreased by equity contributions or repayments.\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares or options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no new MIP issues from the LTIP Hosting plan in the reporting period.\n\nFair value is determined on the basis of the individual strike price, the enterprise value as at the grant date and the remaining term until the trigger event, using the Black-Scholes model and taking into account the other assumptions mentioned above. As the exercise prices of the MIP units already take into account equity returns, it is not necessary to additionally consider a dividend yield when measuring the entitlements.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Business Applications peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plan Business Applications has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total program expenditure                                                  | 37,674 | 37,709 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year                      | 37,656 | 36,501 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                                      | 18     | 1,208  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                                          | 1,155  | 3,688  |\n| Fair value of the commitments granted in the fiscal year at the grant date | 0      | 0      |\n\nThe changes in the MIP units granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Units    | Average strike price (€ |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 460,071  | 173.36                  |\n| Additional grant as part of the IPO | 20,429   | 329.98                  |\n| Change into 'Rollover' programm     | -389,625 | 168.58                  |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -625     | 358.80                  |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 90,250   | 130.29                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0        | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0        | n/a                     |\n\nThe IPO did not involve a complete exit of WP XII Ventures Holdings S à r l, but only a partial sale. The IPO of IONOS Group SE on February 8, 2023 did not therefore constitute a triggering event as defined by the LTIP Hosting agreement. Accordingly, the IPO did not result in the claims of the individual participants becoming due. For the remaining participants in the LTIP Hosting, however, a further approx. 11% of the claims from the LTIP Hosting will be fixed at the issue price of the IPO on February 8, 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, all active employees of the LTIP Hosting plan were offered a so-called IPO transition agreement or rollover agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"rollover\"). As part of this rollover, active employees could convert their LTIP Hosting MIP units into subscription rights for IONOS Group SE shares.\n\nIn the course of the rollover, 389,625 MIPs were converted. The remaining MIPs mainly relate to former members of the management board.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IPO awards (virtual stock options as part of the rollover) were calculated in a two-step process based on the assumption of a complete divestment by Warburg Pincus (WP). In the first step, the increase in value per participant was derived on the basis of the LTIP (Long Term Incentive Plan) Hosting conditions. An increase in value was determined for around 25% of the shares due to a share buyback in 2021 and an enterprise value of € 4.8 billion. For the remaining approx. 75% of the MIP I units (LTIP Hosting), the increase in value at the time of the IPO was considered relevant, whereby the IPO issue price of € 18.50 was used to determine the increase in value. The total increase in value per participant was determined on the basis of these calculations.\n\nIn a second step, the increase in value achieved per participant was divided by the IPO issue price to determine the number of virtual shares in IONOS Group SE. Participants who did not achieve an increase in value by the time of the IPO did not receive any virtual shares but had the option of remaining in the LTIP Hosting. The number of calculated IPO awards was then fixed and distributed in three tranches.\n\nThe IPO awards were generally allocated in three equal tranches over a period of up to 24 months after the IPO. The number of virtual stock options could vary slightly between the tranches so that the number of options per participant and the number per tranche for each participant was a whole number. The tranches were allocated as follows:\n\n- Tranche 1 on the IPO date (February 8, 2023),\n- Tranche 2 eighteen months later (August 2024) and\n- Tranche 3 twenty-four months after the IPO (February 2025).\n\nThe payment of Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 is generally linked to remaining in the company until the payment date. It can be made in cash or in equity instruments, whereby the company reserves the right to decide how this is granted. The cash payment amount depends on the performance of the IONOS share. The cash payment for the 2023 tranche is to be classified as an exception due to the lock-up period for the sale of shares in connection with the IPO, meaning that an equity-settled commitment continues to be recognized in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nA different arrangement was made for certain participants as their service agreements ended prematurely. A total of 2,210,243 virtual stock options were calculated as of February 8, 2023.\n\nThe changes in the outstanding virtual share options resulting from the conversion of the MIP units are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Virtual share<br>options | Average strike<br>price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 0                        | n/a                         |\n| Emission IPO                        | 2,210,243                | n/a                         |\n| Payout IPO                          | -736,756                 | n/a                         |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -13,743                  | n/a                         |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 1,459,744                | n/a                         |\n\nIn the course of fulfilling Tranche 1, a total of € 13.6m was paid out to the beneficiaries.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Long-Term Incentive Plan WE22**\n\n \n\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the Business Applications segment introduced a further employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) for selected members of the management board and the managing directors of the we22 Group (we22 AG including subsidiaries and investments). The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of employees of the we22 Group (Business Applications segment) with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the we22 Group and IONOS Group SE.\n\nWithin the LTIP plan, qualifying employees of the we22 Group are allocated so-called Management Incentive Plan (MIP) units, whose value is calculated by deducting a fixed strike price from the enterprise value of IONOS Group SE. Vesting is on a straight-line basis over a period of around four years (beginning with the date of issue) and on condition that the respective employee has not resigned by the end of each year or by December 31, 2024. Alternatively, in the event of a change of control at IONOS SE before the end of 2024, a portion of the beneficiaries must remain with the company until nine months after the change of control occurs in order to receive an entitlement. As such a change of control is currently not likely, this variant is not considered in the measurement of the plan. Claims are settled in cash and are therefore recognized as share-based remuneration with cash settlement.\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no new MIP issues from the LTIP WE22 plan in the reporting period.\n\nFair value was calculated using a Black-Scholes model. The volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Business Applications peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nAs the strike prices of the MIP units already take into account equity repayments, there was no additional consideration of a dividend yield when measuring the entitlements.\n\nThe WE22 plan has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                                         | 2023   | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                                                  | 128    | 2,531 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year                      | 106    | 1,308 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                                      | 22     | 1,224 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                                          | -1,202 | 639   |\n| Fair value of the commitments granted in the fiscal year at the grant date | 0      | 0     |\n\nThe changes in the MIP units granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Units  | Average strike price (€ |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 70,338 | 161.56                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2021 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| expired                             | -1,875 | 161.56                  |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 68,463 | 161.56                  |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0      | n/a                     |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0      | n/a                     |\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **36.3 Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR IONOS)**\n\nIn December 2022, a new incentive plan was also introduced for the management board members of IONOS Group SE on condition of a successful IPO. The SAR plan employs so-called Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and is treated as an equity-settled, shared-based payment transaction. SARs refer to the commitment of IONOS Group SE to pay the beneficiary a cash amount equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting the option (agreed strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 110% of the strike price after three years, 115% after four years, and 120% after five years. The strike price is calculated as the average closing price in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. Payment of value growth to the beneficiary is limited – depending on the arrangements of the different tranches – to 100% of the calculated share price (strike price), or to 150% of the calculated share price (strike price).\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of IONOS Group SE. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of IONOS Group SE. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the Company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, IONOS Group SE retains the right to fulfill its commitment to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring IONOS Group SE shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. The program is thus recognized as an equity-settled plan, as there is no present obligation to settle in cash.\n\nUp to 33.33% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 66.66% at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; and the full amount at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. Vesting is thus one-third in each of the aforementioned periods.\n\nHowever, the SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Moreover, additional reductions in the payout amounts are possible in connection with predefined ESG targets. At the time of preparing the Annual Financial Statements, these targets are not yet known. Within the framework of the ESG targets, the entitlements can be reduced by a maximum of 10% if targets are not met. The IPO of IONOS Group SE was on February 8, 2023, which also corresponds to the grant date.\n\nThe exercise behavior is based on the assumption that participants will exercise their SARs at the earliest possible date, similar to comparable programs within the United Internet Group. It is expected that one third of the SARs will be exercised in the first window after the third year, a further third after the fourth year and the final third after the fifth year, where possible. The exercise of SARs is limited to two 10-day windows per calendar year, starting shortly after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the publication of the 9-month report.\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value at the grant date of the options issued was calculated as follows:\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Issue date                      | Feb. 08, 2023   | Apr. 01, 2023   | Jul. 01, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Number of SARs                  | 4,016,216       | 195,000         | 762,000         |\n| Starting price                  | 18.50 €         | 14.82 €         | 13.02 €         |\n| Strike price                    | 18.50 €         | 14.13 €         | 13.13 €         |\n| Average market value per option | 4.81 €          | 3.92 €          | 3.28 €          |\n| Dividend yield                  | 0.20% %         | 0.27% %         | 0.31% %         |\n| Volatility of the share         | 37.39% %        | 36.77% %        | 33.54% %        |\n| Expected term (years)           | 6 years         | 6 years         | 6 years         |\n| risk-free interest rate         | 2.31% - 2.66% % | 2.27% - 2.71% % | 2.45% - 3.35% % |\n\nAs part of the simulation, both the limit on the payout per SAR and the respective exercise hurdles per tranche were taken into account. As the SARs are not entitled to dividends, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of IONOS Group SE as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated from the weighted average of the price fluctuations of the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) or the last 360 days (2/3 weighting) of the peer group of the Hosting segment, as the IONOS Group SE share price had been quoted for less than 360 days as at the reporting date.\n\nThe SAR IONOS plan had the following effects in the fiscal year:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 22,601 | n.a  |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 5,706  | n.a  |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 16,895 | n.a  |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 5,706  | n.a  |\n\nThe changes in the SARs granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Number    | Average strike<br>price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 0         | 0.00                        |\n| expired / forfeited                 | 0         | 0.00                        |\n| Expenses                            | 4,973,216 | 17.51                       |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 4,973,216 | 17.51                       |\n\n## **36.4 Long-Term Incentive Plan Versatel (LTIP Versatel)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan, LTIP) was introduced for the Business Access segment in the fiscal year 2018. The LTIP is designed to align the long-term interests of management board members and other key employees of the 1&1 Versatel Group (Business Access segment) with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the company (1&1 Versatel GmbH) and other companies of the 1&1 Versatel Group.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe plan entitles the beneficiaries to participate in a specified share of any increase in value of the 1&1 Versatel Group. Within the LTIP plan, qualifying employees in the Business Access segment are allocated stock appreciation rights.\n\nVesting is on a straight-line basis over a period of six years (beginning with the date of issue), or until the occurrence of an event defined in the LTIP plan conditions (trigger event), and provided that the employee concerned has not resigned by the end of each year or by the occurrence of a trigger event. The LTIP entitlement arises as soon as the full term of the LTIP contract ends (i.e., after six years) or an event as defined by the LTIP plan conditions occurs. After six years or on occurrence of a trigger event the respective LTIP entitlement becomes due.\n\nThe LTIP entitlement is calculated as the difference between the final value and the individual starting value (in each case based on the enterprise value at the time in question), which is multiplied by the respective stock appreciation right and a dilution factor.\n\nThe recognition of expenses per participant is on a straight-line basis over the period ending with the expiry of the respective LTIP contract, provided no trigger event occurs. In the event of an (imminent) trigger event, expenses are recognized in full up to the (expected) occurrence of the trigger event. As no trigger event is currently expected, this variant is not considered in the measurement of claims. This assessment is reviewed at each reporting date. Based on the current estimates, a total period of six years is assumed in each case.\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares or options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Versatel peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plan Versatel has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 12,053 | 8,449 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 4,878  | 3,562 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 7,175  | 4,887 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 1,316  | 1,352 |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                     |                   |  | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|--|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 3.1% value growth |  | 2,743                    |\n| expired                             | 0.6%              |  | 3,695                    |\n| Allocation                          | 1.4%              |  | 4,110                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 3.9%              |  | 3,122                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0                 |  | 0                        |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0                 |  | 0                        |\n\n## **36.5 Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR 1&1)**\n\n \n\nThe Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch) plan introduced in the first half of 2018 existed until April 17, 2020. It was aimed at management board members, executives and employees in key positions and based on virtual stock options of 1&1 AG (formerly 1&1 Drillisch AG).\n\nAn SAR Drillisch was the commitment of 1&1 AG (or one of its subsidiaries) to pay the option beneficiary a consideration whose amount depended on the share price performance and the operating result (EBIT) of 1&1 AG (consolidated). As part of the SAR plan, so-called SARs were allocated which were then granted over the vesting period. An SAR corresponded to a virtual subscription right for one share of 1&1 AG. However, it was not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of 1&1 AG. The entitlement arising from an SAR depended on the development of the share price and EBIT.\n\nThe old SAR Drillisch plan was canceled during the course of fiscal year 2020. At the time of cancellation, 77,400 stock options were outstanding and replaced by new equity instruments.\n\nA new plan was introduced on April 17, 2020. The new employee stock ownership model, the so-called Stock Appreciation Rights Drillisch (SAR Drillisch), is aimed at the group of management board members, executives and employees in key positions and based on virtual stock options of 1&1 AG. According to the current conditions, an SAR Drillisch is the commitment of 1&1 AG (or one of its subsidiaries), to pay the option beneficiary a consideration equivalent to the difference between the share price on the date of granting (strike price) and the share price on exercising the option. The exercise hurdle is 120% of the strike price. The strike price is the average closing price for the company share in electronic trading (Xetra) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the ten days preceding issuance of the option. Payment of value growth to the entitled person is capped at 100% of the calculated share price (strike price). In 2023, an additional issue (second issue) of SARs was made for existing participants. In contrast to the previous issues, the payout amount of the first issue was offset against the second issue.\n\nAn SAR corresponds to a virtual subscription right for one share of 1&1 AG. However, it is not a share right and thus not a (genuine) option to acquire shares of 1&1 AG. The beneficiaries are not entitled to a possible dividend payment by the company. As a rule, settlement is in cash. Nevertheless, 1&1 AG retains the right to fulfill its commitment (or the commitment of a subsidiary) to pay the SAR in cash by also transferring 1&1 AG shares from its stock of treasury shares to the beneficiary, at its own discretion. As there is currently no obligation to settle in cash from the Group's perspective, these obligations are recognized as equity-settled transactions.\n\nThose entitled to exercise options have an exercise window of 10 days. This begins on the 3rd day after the annual shareholders' meeting or after publication of the 9-month report. Up to 25% of the option right may be converted at the earliest 24 months after the date of issue of the option; up to 50% at the \n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nearliest 36 months after the date of issue of the option. A total of up to 75% may be exercised at the earliest 48 months after the date of issue of the option; the full amount may be exercised at the earliest 60 months after the date of issue of the option, provided that the beneficiary concerned has not given notice of termination at the end of each year. The SARs have a basic term of six years, so that after this period all unexercised SARs lapse without compensation. Tranches that are not exercised during the available exercise window can be exercised during the next regular exercise window for the tranche. Beyond this, no further conditions have to be met for the SARs to be successfully awarded.\n\nUsing an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model / Monte Carlo simulation) in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value as at the grant date of the options issued was calculated as follows:\n\n| Issue date                      |  | Apr. 01, 2023 | May 01, 2023 | Jun. 01, 2023 | Aug. 01, 2023 |\n|---------------------------------|--|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Number of SARs                  |  | 385,000       | 150,000      | 28,000        | 2,765,000     |\n| Starting price                  |  | 10.27 €       | 10.54 €      | 10.14 €       | 10.24 €       |\n| Strike price                    |  | 10.77 €       | 10.47 €      | 10.27 €       | 10.14 €       |\n| Average market value per option |  | 1.70 €        | 1.89 €       | 1.84 €        | 2.18 €        |\n| Dividend yield                  |  | 0.49%         | 0.47%        | 0.49%         | 0.49%         |\n| Volatility of the share         |  | 28.83%        | 28.99%       | 29.89%        | 29.65%        |\n| Expected term (years)           |  | 5 years       | 5 years      | 5 years       | 5 years       |\n| risk-free interest rate         |  | 2.71%         | 2.84%        | 2.97%         | 3.29%         |\n\n| Issue date                      |  | Jan. 1, 2022 |       | Oct. 01, 2022 |       |\n|---------------------------------|--|--------------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| Number of SARs                  |  | 258,000      |       | 21,000        |       |\n| Starting price                  |  | 24.02        | €     | 13.49         | €     |\n| Strike price                    |  | 24.11        | €     | 14.28         | €     |\n| Average market value per option |  | 4.05         | €     | 1.81          | €     |\n| Dividend yield                  |  | 0.21         | %     | 0.37          | %     |\n| Volatility of the share         |  | 31.05        | %     | 22.47         | %     |\n| Expected term (years)           |  | 5            | years | 5             | years |\n| risk-free interest rate         |  | 0            | %     | 1.363         | %     |\n\nThe volatility used to determine the fair value was calculated as a weighted average on the basis of the historical volatility for the last 6 (1/3 weighting) and 12 months (2/3 weighting) prior to the measurement date, respectively. The strike price is calculated on the basis of the average share price of the last 10 days prior to the issuance date.\n\nThe capped payout per SAR was reflected by deducting the value of an option valuation at twice the strike price. With regard to the exercise windows of the SARs, the option valuation assumed the earliest possible exercise. As the SARs have no dividend entitlement, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the share price of 1&1 AG as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs in accordance with IFRS 2.B34.\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the fair value of the secondary issues in order to illustrate the offsetting of the payout amount between the old tranche and the second tranche for selected participants. With regard to the exercise windows, the earliest possible exercise was assumed for the simulation. Moreover, both the capped payout per SAR and the respective exercise hurdles per tranche were taken into account. In accordance with IFRS 2.B34, a dividend yield based on the dividend for the respective fiscal year and the 1&1 AG share price as at the reporting date was taken into account when measuring the SARs.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SAR Drillisch plan has the following effects:\n\n \n\n| €k                                                    | 2023   | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                             | 15,066 | 9,871 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year | 8,252  | 6,877 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                 | 6,814  | 2,994 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                     | 1,375  | 1,834 |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Number    | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 | 2,745,000 | 20.23                    |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -396,500  | 20.14                    |\n| Expenses - Reallocation             | 258,000   | 24.11                    |\n| Expenses - Reallocation             | 21,000    | 14.28                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 2,627,500 | 20.58                    |\n| expired / forfeited                 | -483,000  | 21.70                    |\n| Expenses                            | 3,328,000 | 10.23                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 5,472,500 | 14.18                    |\n\n## **36.6 Long-Term Incentive Plan Portal (LTIP Consumer Application)**\n\nAn additional employee stock ownership plan (LTIP Portal) was introduced by 1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE in the fiscal year 2019. The LTIP is designed to attract and retain skilled employees as well as to align the long-term interests of management board members, executives, and other key employees of the group with the interests of the company, in order to raise the equity value of the company (1&1 Mail & Media Applications SE) and other companies of the group.\n\nThe plan entitles the beneficiaries to participate in a certain proportion of the increase in value of the 1&1 Mail & Media Group. Within the LTIP plan, qualifying employees are allocated stock appreciation rights.\n\nVesting is on a straight-line basis over an individually defined period (four to six years, beginning with the date of issue), or until the occurrence of a special event defined in the LTIP plan conditions (trigger event), and provided that the employee concerned has not resigned by the end of each year or by the occurrence of a trigger event. The LTIP entitlement arises as soon as the full term of the LTIP contract or a trigger event occurs.\n\nThe recognition of expenses per participant is on a straight-line basis over the period ending with the expiry of the respective LTIP contract, provided no trigger event occurs. In the event of an (imminent) trigger event, expenses are recognized in full up to the (expected) occurrence of the trigger event. As no trigger event is currently expected, this variant is not considered in the measurement of claims. This assessment is reviewed at each reporting date. Based on the current estimates, a total period of four to six years is assumed (depending on the individual agreement).\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entitlements under the LTIP plan can be settled in the form of shares or cash. In the case of settlement in the form of shares, rights may be settled by the provision of shares in the company, provided they are traded on a stock exchange in the meantime, or shares in another company listed on a stock exchange, or the corresponding options to acquire shares. As there is no current obligation for cash settlement, the plan is carried as equity-settled.\n\nThe fair value of the issued options as at the grant date is determined using an option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe volatility used to determine fair value was calculated using the weighted average price fluctuations of the Portal peer group over the last 180 days (1/3 weighting) and the last 360 days (2/3 weighting), respectively.\n\nThe LTIP Consumer Application has the following effects:\n\n| €k                                                      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Total program expenditure                               | 8,943 | 9,407 |\n| Accumulated expenses until the end of the fiscal year   | 5,906 | 4,928 |\n| Expenses attributable to future years                   | 3,037 | 4,479 |\n| Personnel expenses in fiscal year                       | 978   | 1,693 |\n| Fair value of commitments granted in the financial year | 0     | 0     |\n\nThe changes in the virtual stock options granted and outstanding are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Value growth shares | Average strike price (€) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 | 5.0% value growth   | 1,881                    |\n| Allocation                          | 1.0%                | 2,496                    |\n| expired                             | 0.7%                | 4,327                    |\n| Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 5.3%                | 1,982                    |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 | 0                   | 0                        |\n| Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 | 0                   | 0                        |\n\n## 37. Capital stock\n\nFollowing the capital reduction through cancellation of 2 million treasury shares, as resolved by the Management Board with the approval of the Supervisory Board on February 14, 2023, the fully paid-in capital stock as of December 31, 2023 amounted to €192,000,000 (prior year: € 194,000,000) divided into 192,000,000 registered no-par shares with a theoretical share in the capital stock of € 1.00 each.\n\n#### **Authorized Capital**\n\nAuthorized Capital 2020, which authorized the Management Board to increase the capital stock by a maximum of € 77,500,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par shares for cash and/or non-cash contributions), expired on August 31, 2023. On May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted a resolution to create a new Authorized Capital 2023 with effect from September 1, 2023 with\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe possibility to exclude subscription rights and a corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association.\n\n \n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock in the period ending August 31, 2026, by a maximum of € 75,000,000.00 by issuing on one or more occasions new no-par shares for cash and/or non-cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2023). In the case of cash contributions, the new shares may – at the option of the Management Board – also be underwritten, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by one or several credit institutions and/or any other company fulfilling the requirements of section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG subject to the obligation to offer the shares only to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription rights).\n\nShareholders are to be granted subscription rights with the following restrictions. The Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the right to subscribe in the case of fractional amounts and also to exclude subscription rights to the extent that this should be necessary in order to grant subscription rights for new shares to bearers of warrants and convertible bonds issued by the Company or its subsidiaries in the amount to which they would be entitled on exercise of their warrant or conversion rights or fulfillment of their conversion obligation.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a capital increase in return for cash contributions, the Management Board is authorized to exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shareholders' subscription rights for an amount of up to 10% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or – if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted if the new shares are issued at an issuance price which is not substantially below the market price of those Company shares already listed at the time of the final determination of the issuance price, which is to be as near in time as possible to the share issue date. This maximum amount includes any shares that are issued or to be issued under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds provided that the bonds are issued during the term of this authorization in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG with subscription rights excluded; also, the amount must take into account any shares that are issued or sold during the term of this authorization pursuant to or in analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG.\n\nThe Management Board is further authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the case of capital increases in return for non-cash contribution in order to grant shares for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in companies or other assets, including rights and receivables, or as part of business combinations.\n\nThe above mentioned authorizations to exclude subscription rights are limited in total to an amount of up to 20% of the capital stock existing at the time Authorized Capital 2023 becomes effective or – if this amount is lower – at the time the resolution to use Authorized Capital 2023 is adopted. This maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock includes the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to shares that are subject to conversion and/or warrant rights or conversion obligations under bonds that are issued with warrant and/or conversion rights or conversion obligations during the term of this authorization with subscription rights excluded, as well as the proportionate share of capital stock attributable to treasury shares sold or used during the term of this authorization in a manner other than via the stock exchange or by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe Management Board is further authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and its execution.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Conditional Capital**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 also adopted a resolution to cancel the existing authorization to issue warrants and/or convertible bonds and the associated Conditional Capital 2020 and to issue a new authorization to issue warrants and/or convertible bonds, with the exclusion of subscription rights to these warrants and/or convertible bonds, and at the same time to create conditional capital (Conditional Capital 2023) with a corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association.\n\nThe capital stock is conditionally increased by up to € 18,500,000.00, divided into up to 18,500,000 new no-par value registered shares (Conditional Capital 2023). The conditional capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that the bearers or holders of warrant rights or conversion rights or obligations under bonds with warrants or convertible bonds that have been issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Company's subordinated Group companies in the period ending August 31, 2026, on the basis of the Management Board's authorization resolved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023, exercise their warrant or conversion rights or, to the extent that they are obligated to convert their bonds, fulfill their obligation, or to the extent that the Company exercises a right to grant shares in the Company, instead of paying the cash amount due (or parts thereof), and to the extent that cash compensation is not granted or treasury shares or shares in another listed company are not used to service bonds. The new shares will be issued at the warrant or conversion price to be determined in accordance with the above authorizing resolution. The new shares will participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created; to the extent that it is legally permissible, the Management Board may determine, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the profit participation of new shares and, notwithstanding section 60 (2) AktG, also for a fiscal year already expired.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details concerning the execution of the conditional capital increase.\n\n#### **Interim dividend**\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 20, 2020 created the option of paying an interim dividend with a corresponding amendment to section 21 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## 38. Reserves\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, capital reserves amounted to € 2,197m (prior year: € 1,966m). The increase is mainly due to the sale of shares in IONOS Group SE in the course of the IPO.\n\nUnited Internet received gross proceeds of around € 292m from the sale of shares. The corresponding share of equity in IONOS Group SE amounted to € -16.4m, while the disposal costs recognized in equity amounted to € 3.1m. Taking into account the prorated earnings of around € 1.6m, the total effect of the IPO on reserves amounted to € 303.7m. For further information, please refer to Notes 4 and 46.\n\nMoreover, the reversal of deferred tax assets on employee stock ownership plans and payments in connection with employee stock ownership plans reduced reserves by a total of € 10.6m.\n\nReserves were also reduced by the cancellation of treasury shares amounting to € 61.5m. For further information, please refer to Note 39.\n\nThe accumulated result includes the past results of consolidated companies, less amounts for dividends payouts.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the revaluation reserve attributable to shareholders of United Internet AG consisted of the following items:\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n| €k                                                                | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |               |               |\n| Other shares                                                      | 0             | 0             |\n| Share in other comprehensive income of associated companies:      | 920           | 1,595         |\n| Other shares                                                      | -816          | -312          |\n| Total                                                             | 105           | 1,283         |\n\nTranslation differences from the annual financial statements of foreign subsidiaries without an effect on profit or loss are recognized in the currency translation adjustment.\n\nAn overview of the composition and changes in the reserves described above for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 is provided in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.\n\n# 39. Treasury shares\n\n \n\nThe authorization to acquire and use treasury shares that was granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 20, 2020, under agenda item 15 in accordance with section 71 (1) no. 8 AktG expired on August 31, 2023. Against this background, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 17, 2023 authorized the Management Board pursuant to section 71 (1) number 8 AktG and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to acquire treasury shares for every permissible purpose, within the scope of legal restrictions and subject to the provisions set out under agenda item 11, during the period September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2026. The authorization is limited to a total share of 10% of the capital stock existing at the time the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting adopted the resolution or – if this amount is lower – at the time the authorization is exercised. As of the balance sheet date, a total of 19,183,705 treasury shares were held.\n\nTreasury shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer made to all shareholders or through a public request made to all shareholders to submit sales offers or by granting tender rights to the shareholders.\n\nThe Management Board is also authorized, in addition to a sale via the stock exchange or a use in another manner that complies with the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders, to use treasury shares for the following purposes:\n\n- as (partial) consideration in connection with the acquisition of companies or interests in companies or parts of companies or in connection with business combinations;\n- to float shares of the Company on foreign stock exchanges on which they were previously not admitted to trading;\n- to grant shares of the Company to current and former members of the Management Board and employees of the Company as well as to current and former members of the management boards or, as the case may be, boards of directors and employees of affiliates of the Company within the meaning of sections 15 et seqq. AktG in fulfillment of claims under virtual share participation programs. To the extent members of the Company's Management Board are to be granted shares, the Company's Supervisory Board decides thereon.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders' statutory subscription rights with regard to these treasury shares are excluded in accordance with sections 71 (1) no. 8 and 186 (3) and (4) AktG to the extent that these shares are used pursuant to the above authorizations. Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights for fractional shares if treasury shares are sold by means of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nThe authorization may not be used for the purpose of trading with treasury shares.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board of United Internet AG decided on February 14, 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to make a public share buyback offer to the shareholders of United Internet AG for a total of up to 13.9m shares at a price of € 21.00 per share. The total volume of the share buyback offer therefore amounted to up to € 291.9m. In the course of the public share buyback offer, a total of 27,553,147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period.

Their carrying amounts on the reporting date are thus similar to fair value.\n- Investments and derivatives are carried at fair value. In the case of the remaining other non-current financial assets carried at amortized cost, it is assumed that their carrying amounts correspond to fair value.\n- Trade accounts payable mostly have short remaining terms. Their carrying amounts on the reporting date are thus similar to fair value. The same applies to current liabilities due to banks.\n- Non-current liabilities to banks mainly comprise promissory note loans, syndicated loans, bank loans, and credit facilities. Depending on their structure, these have either fixed or variable interest rates. In the case of most variable-interest liabilities, both the basic interest rate and the margin are variable. The margin depends on predefined KPIs of the United Internet Group. Due to these factors, it is assumed that their carrying amounts of non-current liabilities correspond approximately to fair value. The fair value measurement of the promissory note loans is based at least in part on input parameters not observable on the market. For further details on interest and maturity, please refer to Note 31.\n- Due to changed interest rates, there are slight deviations between the carrying value and fair value of receivables in connection with finance leases.\n- The conditional purchase price liabilities are carried at fair value. In the case of the remaining other non-current financial liabilities carried at amortized cost, it is assumed that their carrying amounts correspond to fair value.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                        | Measureme<br>nt category<br>acc. to | Carrying<br>amount on<br>Dec. 31, | Amortized  | Fair value<br>not through<br>profit or | Fair value<br>through<br>profit or | Measureme<br>nt acc. to | Fair value as<br>of Dec. 31, |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| €k                                                                     | IFRS 9                              | 2022                              | cost       | loss                                   | loss                               | IFRS 16                 | 2022                         |\n| Financial assets                                                       |                                     |                                   |            |                                        |                                    |                         |                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                              | ac                                  | 40,523                            | 40,523     |                                        |                                    |                         | 40,523                       |\n| Trade accounts receivable                                              |                                     |                                   |            |                                        |                                    |                         |                              |\n| -

Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at December 31, 2023, and as in the previous year, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, are not materially different from their calculated fair values.\n- The fair value of bank loans and other financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. They are therefore allocated to level two of the fair value hierarchy.\n- Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are measured using appropriate measurement techniques. Where available, stock exchanges prices on active markets are used. The valuation of shares in non-listed companies is based mainly on present value models. The valuation of derivatives and conditional purchase price liabilities is based mainly option pricing models.\n\n## **Fair value hierarchy**\n\n \n\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by measurement technique:\n\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.\n\n## **Assets and liabilities measured at fair value**\n\n| €k                                                                  | as of Dec. 31,<br>2023 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss               | 14,852                 | 36      |         | 14,816  |\n| Derivatives                                                         | 14,852                 | 36      |         | 14,816  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss | -13,019                |         |         |         |\n| Purchase price liabilities                                          | -10,922                |         |         | -10,922 |\n| Derivatives                                                         | -2,097                 | -2,097  |         |         |\n\nAs in the previous year, there were no transfers between levels during the reporting period.\n\n| €k                                                                     | as of Dec. 31,<br>2022 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                  | 64,536                 | 4,715   |         | 59,821  |\n| Derivatives                                                            | 64,536                 | 4,715   |         | 59,821  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value through<br>profit or loss | -38,656                |         |         | -38,219 |\n| Purchase price liabilities                                             | -38,219                |         |         | -38,219 |\n| Derivatives                                                            | -437                   | -437    |         |         |\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the main non-observable input factors for the fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and a quantitative sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| Dec. 31, 2023                        | Measurement method     | Main non-observable input factors                             | Considered in measurement | Sensitivity of input factor on fair value |                 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Foreign currency-based derivatives   | Monte Carlo simulation | Exit date of Warburg Pincus from Business Application segment | 0.25 year                 | 0.5 year                                  |                 |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | n.a.                                      |                 |\n|                                      |                        | Volatility                                                    | 5.8%                      | -<br>€ 0.2 million                        |                 |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | +1%                                       | n.a.<br>-1%     |\n|                                      |                        |                                                               |                           | +<br>€ 0.2 million                        | -

Members who do not personally attend meetings of the Supervisory Board or of the Audit and Risk Committee held in person (e.g., by participating via telephone or videoconference) always receive only 25% of the attendance fee, and if they participate solely by submitting a voting rights message are not entitled to any attendance fee.\n\nThe following table provides details on the compensation received by members of the Supervisory Board of United Internet AG:\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023                                    | United Internet AG |       |                 | Subsidiaries of United Internet AG |       |                 |       |       |                 | Total |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|-------|-----------------|-------|\n|                                         | €k                 | Fixed | Attendan ce fee | Total                              | Fixed | Attendan ce fee | Total | Fixed | Attendan ce fee |       |\n| Philipp von Bismarck                    | 145                | 25    | 170             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 145   | 25    | 0               | 170   |\n| Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei-Yee Weiß           | 30                 | 17    | 47              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 30    | 17    | 0               | 47    |\n| Dr. Manuel Cubero del Castillo-Olivares | 45                 | 15    | 60              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 45    | 15    | 0               | 60    |\n| Stefan Rasch                            | 55                 | 26    | 81              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 55    | 26    | 0               | 81    |\n| Prof. Dr. Andreas Söffing               | 95                 | 27    | 122             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 95    | 27    | 0               | 122   |\n| Prof. Dr. Franca Ruhwedel               | 37                 | 9     | 46              | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 37    | 9     | 0               | 46    |\n|                                         | 407                | 118   | 525             | 0                                  | 0     | 0               | 407   | 118   | 0               | 525   |\n\n| 2022                                       |       |          | United Internet AG | Subsidiaries of United Internet AG |          |       |       |          |       | Total |  |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|----------|-------|-------|--|\n|                                            |       | Attendan |                    |                                    | Attendan |       |       | Attendan |       |       |  |\n| €k                                         | Fixed | ce fee   | Total              | Fixed                              | ce fee   | Total | Fixed | ce fee   | Other | Total |  |\n| Philipp von Bismarck                       | 145   | 29       | 174                | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 145   | 29       | 0     | 174   |  |\n| Prof. Dr. Yasmin Mei<br>Yee Weiß           | 30    | 14       | 44                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 30    | 14       | 0     | 44    |  |\n| Dr. Claudia Borgas<br>Herold               | 20    | 5        | 25                 | 67                                 | 5        | 72    | 87    | 10       | 0     | 97    |  |\n| Dr. Manuel Cubero del<br>Castillo-Olivares | 45    | 15       | 60                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 45    | 15       | 0     | 60    |  |\n| Stefan Rasch                               | 55    | 29       | 84                 | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 55    | 29       | 0     | 84    |  |\n| Prof. Dr. Andreas<br>Söffing               | 95    | 30       | 125                | 0                                  | 0        | 0     | 95    | 30       | 0     | 125   |  |\n|                                            | 390   | 122      | 512                | 67                                 | 5        | 72    | 457   | 127      | 0     | 584   |  |\n\nThere are no subscription rights or share-based payments for members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n \n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the remuneration of the Management Board. The members of the Management Board are compensated according to performance. This compensation consists of a fixed and a variable element (bonus). A target remuneration figure is agreed for the fixed component and the bonus, which is regularly reviewed. The last review was made in fiscal year 2022. The fixed remuneration component is paid monthly as a salary. The size of the bonus depends on reaching certain, fixed financial targets agreed at the beginning of the fiscal year. These targets are based mainly on sales and earnings figures. The target attainment corridor is generally between 90% to 120%. No bonus is paid below 90% of the agreed target and the bonus calculation ends at 120% of the agreed target. No subsequent amendment of the performance targets is allowed. There is no minimum guaranteed bonus. Payment is generally made after the Annual Financial Statements have been adopted by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThere are no retirement benefits from the Company to members of the Management Board.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, the following table provides details on the compensation received by members of the Management Board:\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023             | Fixed | Variable | Fringe benefits | Total fixed,<br>variable and<br>fringe benefits | Market value of<br>share-based<br>payment<br>granted in 2023 |\n|------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ralph Dommermuth | 0     | 0        | 0               | 0                                               | -                                                            |\n| Martin Mildner   | 163   | 96       | 1,253           | 1,512                                           | -                                                            |\n| Markus Huhn      | 413   | 150      | 6               | 569                                             | -                                                            |\n| Ralf Hartings    | 375   | 188      | 8               | 571                                             | 2,118                                                        |\n|                  | 951   | 434      | 1,267           | 2,652                                           | 2,118                                                        |\n\n| 2022             | Fixed | Variable | Fringe benefits | Total fixed, variable and fringe benefits | Market value of share-based payments granted in 2022 |\n|------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ralph Dommermuth | 0     | 0        | 0               | 0                                         | 0                                                    |\n| Martin Mildner   | 650   | 350      | 11              | 1,011                                     | -                                                    |\n|                  | 650   | 350      | 11              | 1,011                                     | -                                                    |\n\n\\* Share-based remuneration (SARs) are remuneration components with a long-term incentive and are paid out over a total period of 6 years.\n\nTotal Management Board remuneration as defined by section 314 (1) number 6 a and b HGB, i.e., including negative effects from the change in share-based payments, amounted to € 1,614k (prior year: € 1,011k).\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, the total Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration was as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term benefits                                   | 2,677 | 1,523 |\n| Benefits after termination of employment              | 0     | 0     |\n| Other benefits due in the long term                   | 0     | 0     |\n| Benefits on the occasion of termination of employment | 500   | 0     |\n| Share-based payments                                  | -811  | 2,354 |\n|                                                       | 2,366 | 3,877 |\n\nSARs were granted to the Management Board members Ralf Hartings and Markus Huhn in the reporting period.

Objectives and methods of financial risk management\n\n## **Principles of risk management**\n\n \n\nThe risk management system introduced by the United Internet Group is based on the COSO-ERM framework and is described in detail in the Management Report.\n\nThe principles of finance policy are set by the Management Board and monitored by the Supervisory Board. Certain transactions require the prior approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe main financial liabilities used by the Group include bank loans, promissory note loans and overdraft facilities, trade accounts payable, and other financial liabilities.\n\nThe Group holds various financial assets which result directly from its business activities. They consist mainly of trade accounts receivable, and short-term deposits.\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group mainly held primary financial instruments.\n\nThe aim of financial risk management is to limit these risks through ongoing operating and financial activities. The Group is hereby exposed to certain risks with regard to its assets, liabilities, and planned transactions, especially liquidity risks and market risks, as described below.\n\n## **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk constitutes the risk that a company will be unable to meet the financial obligations arising from its financial liabilities. As in the previous year, the general liquidity risk of United Internet consists of the possibility that the Group may not be able to meet its current financial obligations in due time. Especially in view of the cost-intensive rollout of the mobile communications network over many years, both short-term liquidity forecasts and longer-term financial planning are conducted in order to secure the solvency and the financial flexibility of the United Internet Group at all times. We expect to be able to cover investments in the mobile communications network predominantly from existing liquidity and future cash flows from operating activities, as well as loans.\n\nAs a result of the expected positive contribution to liquidity from operations and the interest-optimized use of the credit lines already granted, the Group is able to ensure the continual coverage of its financial needs at all times. The credit commitments granted to the Company by banks and the existing syndicated loan facility offer sufficient flexibility for these needs. In order to maintain financial stability, a balanced financial structure is sought which provides both the diversification of financial instruments and a balanced maturity profile.\n\nGlobal cash requirements and surpluses are managed by the central liquidity management system. The daily automated pooling of bank balances held by the participating Group companies (cash pooling) provides United Internet AG at all times with the predominant proportion of its cash denominated in euro. The Group has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank and netting accounts as well as for the execution of payment transactions.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the Company had total liquid funds of € 27.7m (prior year: € 40.5m) as well as free credit lines of € 842m (prior year: € 360m) and thus has more than sufficient liquidity reserves for the fiscal year 2024. The Management Board assumes that additional lines can be raised on the capital market if necessary.\n\nThe following tables show all contractually fixed payments for redemption, repayments, and interest for financial liabilities carried in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\n|                             | Carrying<br>amount on |           |         |           |         |         |           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|\n| €k                          | Dec. 31,<br>2023      | 2024      | 2025    | 2026      | 2027    | > 2027  | Total     |\n| Liabilities due to banks    | 2,464,260             | 621,195   | 335,441 | 1,384,175 | 229,847 | 78,839  | 2,649,496 |\n| Trade accounts payable      | 702,578               | 699,220   | 0       | 0         | 0       | 3,358   | 702,578   |\n| Other financial liabilities | 913,046               | 200,406   | 128,568 | 133,523   | 128,438 | 322,111 | 913,046   |\n|                             | 4,079,884             | 1,520,820 | 464,009 | 1,517,698 | 358,285 | 404,308 | 4,265,119 |\n| Lease liabilities           | 797,249               | 137,742   | 94,463  | 92,905    | 85,765  | 483,575 | 894,450   |\n|                             | 4,877,133             | 1,658,562 | 558,472 | 1,610,602 | 444,050 | 887,883 | 5,159,569 |\n\nPayments from other financial liabilities mainly comprise payment obligations in connection with the 5G spectrum auction of € 61.3m (prior year: € 61.3m), as well as expected payments from derivatives of € 10.9m (prior year: € 38.2m) in the fiscal year 2024. Payments to the German government do not follow a linear pattern. Cash outflows of € 61.3m (prior year: € 61.3m) are expected in the fiscal years 2024 and 2030, as well as cash outflows of € 128m (prior year: € 128m) each year in the fiscal years 2025 to 2029.\n\n| €k                          | Carrying<br>amount on<br>Dec. 31,<br>2022 | 2023      | 2024    | 2025    | 2026      | > 2026    | Total     |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Liabilities due to banks    | 2,155,499                                 | 679,071   | 242,785 | 265,911 | 814,025   | 226,013   | 2,227,804 |\n| Trade accounts payable      | 566,916                                   | 562,618   | 0       | 0       | 0         | 4,298     | 566,916   |\n| Other financial liabilities | 999,910                                   | 232,606   | 61,441  | 128,442 | 128,444   | 449,021   | 999,954   |\n|                             | 3,722,325                                 | 1,474,294 | 304,226 | 394,353 | 942,469   | 679,331   | 3,794,673 |\n| Lease liabilities           | 646,954                                   | 117,885   | 76,710  | 77,976  | 68,799    | 354,320   | 695,691   |\n|                             | 4,369,279                                 | 1,592,180 | 380,936 | 472,329 | 1,011,268 | 1,033,651 | 4,490,364 |\n\nFor the calculation of cash flows from liabilities to banks, management assumed that the portion of the revolving syndicated loan facility currently used amounting to € 150m (prior year: € 550m) would remain constantly drawn until the end of its term (2025).\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease refer to Note 0 for details on interest and redemption payments for liabilities to banks.\n\nThe Company has no significant concentration of liquidity risks.\n\n## **Market risk**\n\n \n\nThe activities of United Internet are mainly exposed to financial risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock exchange prices, and credit or contingency risks.\n\n#### **Interest risk**\n\nThe interest (rate) risk refers to the risk that fair values or future interest payments on existing and future financial liabilities may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group is fundamentally exposed to interest risks as some of its financial instruments as of the reporting date bear variable interest rates with varying terms. An interest risk exists for drawdowns under the revolving syndicated loan and the syndicated loan totaling € 150m (prior year: € 550m).\n\nWith the aid of the liquidity planning, various investment possibilities or possibilities to reduce surplus liquidity are constantly analyzed. The maturity profile and amount of the Group's variable-rate financial instruments are regularly reviewed and appropriate measures are taken to ensure liquidity and the management of interest risks.\n\nMarket interest rate changes might have an adverse effect on the interest result and are included in our calculation of sensitive factors affecting earnings. In order to present market risks, United Internet has developed a sensitivity analysis which shows the impact of hypothetical changes to relevant risk variables on pre-tax earnings. The reporting period effects are illustrated by applying these hypothetical changes in risk variables to the stock of financial instruments as of the reporting date. A 1% increase or decrease in the Euribor would have affected the financial result of the fiscal year by € +13,342k and € - 13,145k, respectively.\n\nThe Group does not expect any material changes in risk premiums in the foreseeable future. United Internet currently regards the interest risk for its existing variable-rate financial instruments as low.\n\nThe interest risk is negligible for other interest-bearing liabilities. At the end of the reporting period, there were no external interest-hedging transactions.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nA currency risk is the risk that fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments may fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The Group companies are mainly exposed to currency risks as a result of their operations (if revenue and/or expenses are in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective company). In order to cover such foreign currency risks, United Internet strives to achieve an equilibrium between the incoming and outgoing payments in non-functional currencies (so-called natural hedging). Currency risks which do not affect cash flows (i.e., risks from translating the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign companies) are not hedged against. With regard to operating activities, individual Group companies perform their business mainly in their respective functional currencies. As in the previous year, the currency risk from operations is therefore regarded as low. In the reporting period, there were no currency risks which significantly affected cash flows. At the end of the reporting period, there were no external currency-hedging transactions.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe currency risks arising from original financial instruments in a currency and of a monetary nature other than that of the functional currency as of the reporting date were valued by the Company. No material currency risks arose from this analysis.\n\n#### **Stock exchange risk (valuation risk)**\n\nThe United Internet Group recognizes financial assets (equity instruments) as follows:\n\n- measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition or\n- measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nDepending on the measurement category and the share price development of listed investments, changes in equity without affecting income, or income and expenses, may arise.\n\nThere were no listed equity instruments as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n#### **Credit and contingency risk**\n\nAs a result of its operating activities, the Group is exposed to a contingency risk. In order to reduce default risks, a sophisticated and preventive fraud management system has been established which is permanently enhanced. Outstanding amounts are monitored locally and on a continual basis. Individual and lump-sum allowances are made to account for non-avoidable contingency risks.\n\nWith regard to trade accounts receivable, the maximum risk in the gross amount stated in the balance sheet is before allowances. Trade accounts receivable which are not impaired as of the reporting date, are classified according to periods in which they become overdue (see Note 19).\n\n## **Internal rating system**\n\nA pre-contractual fraud check is generally conducted and collection agencies are also used for the management of receivables. In addition, a pre-contractual check of creditworthiness is made in the media sales business.\n\nThe Company has no significant concentration of credit risks.\n\n## **Risks from financial covenants**\n\nThe existing loans of United Internet AG are tied to so-called financial covenants. The infringement of a certain net debt-to-EBITDA ratio could result in individual banks terminating outstanding loans with the Company. In view of the low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of United Internet at present, the probability of infringement is regarded as low. Compliance with the covenants is regularly monitored by the Company's Management Board and was met throughout the year.\n\n## **Capital management**\n\nIn addition to the legal provisions for stock corporations, United Internet AG has no further obligations to maintain capital according to its statutes or other agreements. The key financial indicators used by the Company are mainly performance-oriented. The targets, methods, and processes of capital management are thus subordinate to these performance-oriented financial indicators.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to maintain and adapt its capital structure, the Company can adjust dividend payments or pay capital back to its shareholders, can purchase treasury shares and place them again if required, or issue new shares. Please refer to the statement of changes in shareholders' equity. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no changes were made to the Company's targets, methods, and processes.\n\nPlease refer to Note 31 for further details.\n\n# 44. Contingencies, contingent liabilities, and other commitments\n\n## **Contingent liabilities**\n\n \n\nContingent liabilities represent a possible obligation whose existence depends on the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, or a current obligation whose payment is not likely or whose amount cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nIn the previous years, advance service providers have filed claims in the low three-digit million range (for the purposes of internal classification, amounts of up to € 333m are defined as being in the low three-digit million range, and the claims filed do not exceed this amount in total). As of the reporting date December 31, 2023, United Internet AG considers the claims of the counterparties to be unfounded and regards an outflow of resources for these contingent liabilities as unlikely.\n\n## **Litigation**\n\nLitigation risks mainly relate to various legal disputes of Group subsidiaries.\n\nAccruals for litigation were formed for any commitments arising from these disputes (see Note 33).\n\n## **Guarantees**\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group has issued no guarantees.\n\n## **Guarantees and other obligations**\n\nThe Company is jointly and severally liable for credit lines granted to companies of the United Internet Group by a bank. The credit facilities had only been utilized with regard to guarantees as of the reporting date.\n\nThe Management Board has no knowledge of any other facts which could have a significant, adverse effect on the business activities, the financial situation or the operating result of the Company.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 45. Leases and other financial commitments\n\n## **Group as lessee**\n\nThe obligations mainly comprise leased network obligations including subscriber lines, buildings, technical equipment, and vehicles.\n\nMost leases have options to prolong the contractual relationship. The terms of these prolongation options are negotiable or identical with the current terms. The Company currently intends to exercise all material prolongation options. The Company does not intend to exercise any material termination options. In the case of leases for antenna locations in connection with the 1&1 mobile network, however, no prolongation options beyond the non-cancelable basic term are included in the term as there is no reasonable certainty that they will be exercised (see Note 3). If exercised, the prolongation options not included in the measurement pursuant to IFRS 16 will result in future payment obligations of € 133m (December 31, 2022: € 2.6m).

The maturities range from 15 to 29 years.\n\n## **Operating leases**\n\n1&1 Versatel is a lessor as part of operating leases. The underlying agreements mainly relate to the leasing of fiber-optic pairs. The agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments. Due to the strategic importance of the leased fiber-optic pairs for the respective lessees, the residual value risk is considered to be minor.\n\nTotal income from operating leases amounted to € 40,656k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: € 43,779k). These are entirely attributable to fixed lease payments.\n\nThe maturities of lease payments from operating leases is shown in the table below:\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Due dates in k€ | Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| up to 1 year    | 26,849        | 29,085        |\n| 1 to 2 years    | 20,920        | 23,384        |\n| 2 to 3 years    | 18,060        | 19,883        |\n| 3 to 4 years    | 17,344        | 17,222        |\n| 4 to 5 years    | 15,915        | 16,618        |\n| Over 5 years    | 20,005        | 35,168        |\n|                 | 119,093       | 141,360       |\n\n## **Other financial commitments**\n\nThe main other financial commitments are described below:\n\n| December 31, 2023                  |         |             |\n|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|\n| €k                                 | Current | Non-current |\n| Unrecognized lease obligations     | 1,418   | 250         |\n| Supply and service relationships   | 131,203 | 390,539     |\n| thereof from advertising contracts | 9,935   | 21,920      |\n| Total*                             | 132,621 | 390,790     |\n\n#### **December 31, 2022**\n\n \n\n| €k                                 | Current | Non-current |\n|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|\n| Unrecognized lease obligations     | 2,671   | 1,868       |\n| Supply and service relationships   | 53,298  | 148,030     |\n| thereof from advertising contracts | 19,595  | 31,143      |\n| Total*                             | 55,969  | 149,899     |\n\nThe Group applies the exemptions provided by IFRS 16 for leases with terms ending within 12 months from the date of initial application and the exemption for leases where the underlying asset is of low value. Lease obligations not recognized in the balance sheet due to this application relief amounted to € 1,668k as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: € 4,539k). In addition to the above amounts, cash outflows of € 9,311k result from leases that had not yet commenced as at the end of the reporting period, which are spread over the following ten years.\n\nAs part of the MBA MVNO agreement with Telefónica, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG made a binding purchase of network capacity consisting of data volume as well as voice and SMS contingents for the term of the contract until July 2025. The capacity to be purchased under the terms of the MBA MVNO agreement represents 20% to 30% of the used capacity of the Telefónica network. Following the conclusion of the MBA MVNO agreement, 1&1 is able to decrease or increase the acquired contingents to a defined extent on a quarterly basis. The payments for the service components of the agreement amount to a mid-three-digit million amount per year. An exact amount cannot be determined because the payments depend on various contractual variables, as well as any future decrease or increase of capacities. From summer 2024, 1&1 will use national roaming from Vodafone as planned and gradually reduce its advance services from Telefónica Germany.\n\nOn September 5, 2019, the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 AG signed an agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) and the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) regarding the construction of mobile communication sites in so-called \"not-spots\". As a result, 1&1 is committed to make total investments of € 50m. 1&1 is thus helping to close existing supply \n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\ngaps and improve the provision of mobile communications in rural regions by building base stations. These commitments are not included in the other commitments listed above as they are interest-like in nature.\n\n# 46. Statement of cash flows\n\nIncome tax payments in fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 267.1m (prior year: € 287.5m), while income tax proceeds totaled € 26.6m (prior year: 22.8m).\n\nCash and cash equivalents do not include amounts which are only usable under certain conditions (prior year: € 0k).\n\n| Reconciliation of balance sheet changes in liabilities from financial activities: |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n|                                                                                   |  |\n\n|                                             | Jan. 01,<br>2023    | cash transactions |                      | non-cash transactions             |                      |                                   | Dec. 31, 2023       |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | Carrying<br>amounts | Redemption        | Interest<br>payments | Borrowings<br>from<br>liabilities | Interest<br>expenses | Transfers<br>and other<br>changes | Carrying<br>amounts |\n| Non-current loan liabilities                | 1,498.8             | -400.0            | 0.0                  | 1,012.0                           | 0.0                  | -229.0                            | 1,881.8             |\n| Short-term loan liabilities                 | 656.7               | -382.0            | -65.0                | 75.0                              | 66.8                 | 230.4                             | 581.9               |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 646.9               | -121.3            | -21.4                | 271.6                             | 21.3                 | 0.0                               | 797.2               |\n| Spectrum liabilities                        | 825.0               | -61.3             | 0.0                  | 0.0                               | 6.1                  | -6.1                              | 763.0               |\n| Total liabilities from financing activities | 3,627.4             | -964.6            | -86.4                | 1,358.6                           | 94.2                 | -4.7                              | 4,024.6             |\n\n|                                             | Jan. 1, 2022        |            | cash transactions    |                                   | non-cash transactions | Dec. 31, 2022                     |                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | Carrying<br>amounts | Redemption | Interest<br>payments | Borrowings<br>from<br>liabilities | Interest<br>expenses  | Transfers<br>and other<br>changes | Carrying<br>amounts |\n| Non-current loan liabilities                | 1,497.2             | 0.0        | 0.0                  | 300.0                             | 0.0                   | -298.4                            | 1,498.8             |\n| Short-term loan liabilities                 | 325.4               | -367.5     | -18.3                | 400.3                             | 18.5                  | 298.4                             | 656.7               |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 515.2               | -112.5     | -11.9                | 244.2                             | 11.9                  | 0.0                               | 646.9               |\n| Spectrum liabilities                        | 886.3               | -61.3      | 0.0                  | 0.0                               | 6.5                   | -6.5                              | 825.0               |\n| Total liabilities from financing activities | 3,224.1             | -541.3     | -30.2                | 944.5                             | 36.9                  | -6.5                              | 3,627.4             |\n\nInitial recognition of the 5G spectrum in the fiscal year 2019 was made against the background of the deferral and installment payment agreed with the German government, extending the balance sheet and thus neutralizing cash flow. Leases are always recognized directly in equity upon initial recognition. Current payments include interest and repayment components and are reported in cash flow from financing activities.\n\nCash flows in connection with the change in other financial liabilities of € 111.8m (prior year: € 123.5m) are recognized in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nCash inflows and outflows from/to minority shareholders mainly relate to cash inflows in connection with the IPO of IONOS Group SE amounting to € 291.8m and related costs of € 3.1m.\n\nIn addition, there was a cash inflow of € 17.1m from a subsequent purchase price adjustment in connection with the partial exit of Warburg Pincus as part of the IPO.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Change in the presentation of the cash flow statement**\n\n \n\nIn order to reconcile EBITDA and free cash flow more effectively, the Group has adjusted interest payments in cash flow and no longer discloses them in operating activities, but in cash flow from financing activities. As interest expense is not included in EBITDA – which serves as a measure of operating profit and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization – the inclusion of interest payments in operating cash flow may distort the presentation of the actual operating performance.\n\nBy transferring interest payments to cash flow from financing activities, the Company's financial result can be presented more accurately and with greater consistency between EBITDA and free cash flow. Moreover, the interest portion of the repayments of lease liabilities has been eliminated, thus enabling the entire outflow of interest payments to be presented in one line.\n\nAs a result, this measure contributes to a more transparent presentation of the Company's financial performance and clarifies the Company's ability to repay its debts. Moreover, it allows a (more) transparent and (more) comparable presentation of cash flow, thus giving investors and other stakeholders a better understanding of the Company's financial performance.\n\nThe resulting effect on presentation in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 is presented below:\n\n| in € million                        | 2023  |      | 2022 |      |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|------|------|------|\n|                                     | new   | old  | new  | old  |\n| Operative cash flow                 | 1,018 | 946  | 1011 | 992  |\n| Cash flow from investing activities | -798  | -800 | -702 | -704 |\n| Cash flow from financing activities | -44   | 30   | 14   | 35   |\n\n# 47.

In addition, we have audited the Group Management Report of United Internet AG, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n#### *Basis for the Audit Opinions*\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German\n\n252\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\ncommercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\n#### *Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements*\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- Appropriateness of revenue recognition\n- Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use (spectrum)\n- Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n- Matter and issue\n- Audit approach and findings\n- Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### Appropriateness of revenue recognition\n\n In the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG, revenue (sales) of EUR 6,213.2 million is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. This significant item in terms of its amount is subject to particular risk due to the complexity of the processes and controls necessary for correct recognition and deferral, the impact of ever-changing business, price and tariff models (including tariff structures, customer discounts, incentives), and the existence of multiple-element arrangements.\n\nIn addition, the accounting standard applicable to revenue recognition, IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15), requires estimates and judgments in certain areas – such as determining the transaction price and allocating it to the performance obligations identified in a multiple-element arrangement based on the relative stand-alone selling prices – that had to be assessed for appropriateness in the context of our audit. Against this background, the accounting treatment of revenue was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\nIn the knowledge that the complex nature of this matter and the need to make estimates and assumptions give rise to an increased risk of accounting misstatements, as part of our audit we began by assessing the processes and controls put in place by the Group, including the IT systems used for the purposes of revenue recognition. In particular, we assessed the IT system environment \n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor billing and measurement, other relevant systems supporting the accounting treatment of revenue, and the billing and measurement systems right up to entries in the general ledger.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the transaction prices to be determined based on contracts with customers and their allocation to the performance obligations identified in a multiple-element arrangement on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices, and assessed whether these obligations were satisfied over time or at a point in time. In this context, we also assessed the appropriateness of the procedure used to allocate revenue to the correct period, and the estimates and judgments made by the executive directors with respect to revenue recognition and accrual/deferral. We took account of the increased inherent risk in the case of manual entries, in particular by performing additional analytical audit procedures, for instance by means of time series analyses or by forming ratios. Furthermore, we assessed the accounting consequences of new business, price and tariff models and the appropriateness of the associated changes to the processes and IT systems used for the purposes of revenue recognition. We examined customer invoices and the related contracts, as well as payments received on a test basis for selected companies and revenue streams. We applied consistent audit procedures for the audit of the operating subsidiaries to ensure that we responded appropriately throughout the Group to the inherent audit risk relating to revenue recognition.\n\nWe were able to satisfy ourselves that the systems, processes and controls in place are appropriate and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with respect to revenue recognition are sufficiently documented and substantiated to ensure that revenue is properly accounted for.\n\nThe Company's disclosures relating to revenue recognition in the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG are contained in the sections \"2.1 Explanation of main accounting measurement policies\", \"3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\" and \"5. Sales revenue/segment reporting\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use (spectrum)\n\n Non-current assets amounting in total to EUR 9,405.6 million are reported in the consolidated financial statements of United Internet AG. Goodwill amounting in total to EUR 3,628.8 million (32.3% of total assets or 65.3% % of equity) is reported under the \"Goodwill\" balance sheet item. Furthermore, intangible assets (spectrum) amounting to EUR 1,069.7 million (10.3% of total assets or 20.2% of equity) are reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item that, in part, are not yet available for use and thus not subject to amortization (hereinafter \"intangible assets (spectrum)\").\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets (spectrum) are tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any need for write-downs. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the respective cash-generating units to which the goodwill or intangible assets (spectrum) are allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating unit, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal in the case of the cash-generating units of the Business Applications and Consumer Applications segments, and using the value in use for the \"1&1 Consumer Access\" (goodwill) and \"1&1 Mobile Network\" (intangible assets (spectrum)) cash-generating units in the Consumer Access segment. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cashgenerating unit normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted budget of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about the Group's medium term business\n\n254\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\ndevelopment and long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating unit. The impairment tests on goodwill and on intangible assets (spectrum) determined that no writedowns were necessary in financial year 2023.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment tests is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rates of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuations, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash flows used for the calculation against the adopted budget and the medium-term business plan of the Group prepared on this basis, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied and the growth rates can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate and the growth rates applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company. We verified that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes relating to cashgenerating units for which a reasonably possible change in an assumption would result in the recoverable amount falling below the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including the allocated goodwill or intangible assets (spectrum).\n\nOverall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures relating to the \"Goodwill\" balance sheet item and to intangible assets (spectrum) are contained in the sections \"2.1 Explanation of main accounting measurement policies\", \"3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions\", \"27. Intangible assets (without goodwill)\", \"28. Goodwill\" and \"29. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, as well as intangible assets not yet usable (spectrum licenses)\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Other Information*\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\n- the section \"1.4 Main focus areas for products and innovations\" of the group management report\n- the disclosures marked as unaudited in sections \"2.2 Business development\", \"2.3 Position of the Group\" and \"5. Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report\n- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB included in section \"7. Corporate governance declaration\" of the group management report\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\nthe separate non-financial group report to comply with §§ 315b to 315c HGB\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n all remaining parts of the annual report – excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## *Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial* Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n256\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and supplementary compliance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this Group Management Report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the Group Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the Group Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### **OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n#### **Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a** HGB\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file unitedinternetag\\_KA\\_ZLB\\_2023-12- 31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").

[number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material noncompliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited Group Management Report.\n- Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n260\n\n{260}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation*\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 17 May 2023.

The consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited Group Management Report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n## **GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT**\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Erik Hönig.\n\nDüsseldorf, March 19, 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nErik Hönig Christian David Simon Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüfer\n\n[German Public Auditor] [German Public Auditor]\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\n# RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the Group, and the Management Report and Group Management Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.\n\nMontabaur, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nRalph Dommermuth Ralf Hartings Markus Huhn\n\nh.S.Ch\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **United Internet AG**\n\nElgendorfer Straße 57 56410 Montabaur Germany\n\nwww.united-internet.com",
