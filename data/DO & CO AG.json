Food donations at events are becoming a regular request and requirement. We are proud to work with our partners to find the best solutions for left over produce which is suitable for donating. This year we see a rise in our contributions, especially in Germany and in Türkiye. This is a mixture of both food inventory, but also food leftovers in which we work together with local charities. The largest donations coming from our Turkish unit, who work with location communities to distribute the excess.\n\n#### **5.2. SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING**\n\nSingle-use plastics (SUPs) have become ubiquitous in our modern world, yet their convenience comes at a significant environmental cost. These non-biodegradable materials contribute heavily to plastic pollution in our oceans, to wildlife endangerment, and to microplastic contamination. Furthermore, the production of SUP's consumes valuable resources and often relies on fossil fuels.\n\nDO & CO recognizes the detrimental impact of SUPs and is committed to transitioning towards a sustainable future. This commitment is particularly relevant in our UK operations, where we adhere to the recently implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging – these regulations make producers of the product responsible for the waste disposal of packaging that they produce.\n\nEliminating SUPs entirely can be challenging, especially when considering health and safety regulations within the food service industry. However, this is challenge that we are ready to face here at DO & CO. We are actively working with our partners and our internal industrial design and quality teams to develop innovative and sustainable solutions. This collaborative approach allows us to explore alternatives that meet the highest standards for food safety and hygiene while minimizing our environmental footprint.\n\n| INDICATOR      | RESULT                                                  |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Food donations | 1,139.50 Tonnes<br>(equivalent to<br>2.8 million meals) |\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/3 description: The image shows a close-up of a stack of sandwiches. The sandwiches appear to be made with whole wheat bread and have various fillings, including what looks like salmon, lettuce, and some kind of creamy spread. The sandwiches are stacked on top of each other, creating a layered effect that highlights the different ingredients. The image is well-lit and the focus is on the sandwiches, making them the central subject of the composition.\n\nOur dedication to environmental responsibility extends beyond SUPs and encompasses all our packaging solutions. Our Industrial Design, Quality, and Procurement teams look for an implement solution that align with the EU Circular Economy Strategy (COM/2018/028). This strategy emphasizes the use of recycled materials and the design of products for reuse, recycling, or composting.\n\n### 5.2.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\ndesign departments to eliminate SUPs items where appropriate. This includes items such as bags, lids, straws, packaging, and cutlery, with a goal to eliminate them from our operations by 2030. While certain food safety requirements currently prevent the complete elimination of SUPs, we are committed to continually searching for new potential solutions and innovations for the remaining challenging items. We look forward to further developing our measuring and monitoring capabilities in this area. By setting benchmarks with our customers and continuously improving our strategies, we aim to drive impactful change and lead the industry toward a more sustainable future.\n\nWe recognize the significant environmental impact of packaging and are committed to minimizing it. By optimizing designs and utilizing recycled materials, we can significantly reduce our overall packaging footprint. This success hinges on collaborating with our customers to present these innovative and practical solutions. Given our reach of over 170 million people per year, DO & CO is uniquely positioned to raise awareness and present a united sustainable front, setting benchmarks for our industry.\n\nAdditionally, addressing plastic pollution is a top priority. We are partnering with suppliers, customers, and our internal industrial\n\n#### **5.2.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nMaintaining food safety standards is paramount for our products. Therefore, all new packaging undergoes rigorous testing before receiving approval. During the design phase, we consider the full life cycle of the packaging, prioritizing options made from reusable, compostable, or recycled materials wherever feasible. In cases where thermal treatment is necessary, we opt for low-impact sustainable materials to minimize the environmental effect. While packaging plays a vital role in food safety and preservation, improper management can create environmental challenges. Misused packaging can strain resource availability if not recycled responsibly and contribute to pollution if not disposed of properly. Finding the right balance between essential packaging and responsible waste management is crucial.\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/11 description: The image shows a picnic blanket with various food items and accessories.

EU-TAXONOMY\n\n#### **6.1.INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe EU Taxonomy plays a key role in the initiatives of the European Union (EU) for sustainable finances. The EU Taxonomy is a key classification system defining clear criteria to identify economic activities making a reasonable contribution to the transition to a zero-carbon and environmentally sustainable future as set out in the European Green Deal. By directing investments to the targets of the Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy is expected to direct capital to projects and activities that make a substantial contribution to reaching the EU's climate and energy targets for 2030 and to reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nIn line with Regulations (EU) 2020/852 dated 18 June 2020, (EU) 2021/2139 dated 4 June 2021, (EU) 2021/2178 dated 6 July 2021 and (EU) 2022/1214 dated 9 Marc 2022 and the corresponding changes by the delegated acts on environment and climate (EU) 2023/2485 and 2023/2486 dated 27 June 2023, the Company is obligated to transparently disclose three key performance indicators: turnover, CapEx (capital expenditures) and OpEx (operational expenditures). The basic step to determine compliance with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy is to assess climate-relevant aspects of our business activity. The EU Taxonomy calls for reporting on our contribution to selected environmental objectives:\n\n(1) Climate change mitigation (CCM) (2) Climate change adaptation (CCA) (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (WTR) (4) Transition to a circular economy (CE)\n\n(5) Pollution prevention and control (PPC)\n\n(6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)\n\nReaching taxonomy eligibility under the EU Taxonomy Regulation shows that the economic activity of the company is in scope of the EU Taxonomy. Turnover, CapEx (capital expenditures) and OpEx (operational expenditures) related to this activity are considered taxonomy-eligible. The qualification \"taxonomy-aligned\" is stricter. Taxonomy alignment requires that the activity is not only considered taxonomy-eligible but also significantly contributes to at least one of the Taxonomy's six environmental objectives. The contribution must be made without doing significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, meeting relevant technical screening critieria. Furthermore, the climate risk and vulnerability is to be assessed and the company must ensure minimum social safeguards. Turnover, CAPEX and OPEX related to such an activity are considered taxonomy-aligned.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/8 description: A top-down shot captures a bowl of vibrant green soup, elegantly garnished with a swirl of cream, delicate sprouts, and what appears to be small pieces of seafood. The soup is drizzled with a dark oil, adding depth to its visual appeal. The bowl itself is a pristine white, set against a bright white background, which accentuates the colors and textures of the dish.\n\n#### **6.2.PROCEDURE**\n\nAn extensive impact analysis was carried out for all environmental objectives and activities regarding all three KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). In this analysis only CapEx-relevant activities were identified and allocated to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\". This applies in addition to the activity generating turnover of BIO 2.1 comprising hotels, holiday parks, camping sites and similar accommodations.\n\nIn the following, we refer to the business year from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The first essential step of the EU Taxonomy assessment process was identifying DO & CO's taxonomy-eligible economic activities. Assessing taxonomy eligibility started with a thorough analysis in order to identify all significant economic activities of DO & CO. In order to ensure compliance with the EU Taxonomy, it was crucial to identify all relevant economic activities and to classify them pursuant to the determined criteria. since DO & CO Aktiengesellschaft does not carry out any activities determined \"eligible\" under this objective and there are no adjustment plans for identified climate risks regarding CapEx and OpEx. Furthermore, no relevant activities for CapEx, OpEx or turnover were identified for the environmental objectives 3-6, in addition to the above mentioned hotel business generating turnover. Our activities do not contribute to multiple environmental objectives.\n\nThe environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\" does not comprise any taxonomy-eligible activities at the moment, Our finance data are aggregated on group level, but data collection and data assessment is carried out individually at every location. This means, that the raw data is recorded pursuant to the local GAAP of the respective location. During final consolidation and finalisation, group values are taken into account in order to ensure single presentation and comparability. Thus, this approach enables detailed analysis on a local level, while ensuring consistent group reporting.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe financial accounts were classified according to the KPIs. Furthermore, the accounts were categorised as taxonomy-eligible or not taxonomy-eligible pursuant to the EU Taxonomy.\n\nAccounts categorised as taxonomy-eligible have been allocated to the previously identified economic activities. In order to avoid double counting, all KPIs were allocated to the respective economic activities and assessed whether they can be classified as taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned. In cases where the classification taxonomy-eligible relates to several activities, the economic activity is allocated to the environmental objective \"Climate change mitigation\". Turnover, CapEx and OpEx were calculated pursuant to the definition of disclosure included in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\nAfter identifying relevant economic activities of the company, we assessed whether the activities are taxonomy-aligned pursuant to the EU Taxonomy. We assessed whether the relevant economic activities met the criteria for classification as taxonomyaligned. A taxonomy-aligned activity must comply with all three criteria:\n\n- Substantial Contribution: the economic activity substantially contributes to meeting at least one of the six environmental objectives stated in the EU Taxonomy.\n- Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): it is ensured that the economic activity does not significantly harm one of the other five environmental objectives.\n\n| ECONOMIC ACTIVITY                                                                        | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                               | KPI ALLOCATION |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Activity 6.5: Transport by<br>motorbikes, passenger cars<br>nd light commercial vehicles | Financing and leasing activities as well as maintenance activities regarding our passenger and light commercial vehicles. | CapEx          |\n| Activity 6.6 Freight transport<br>services by road                                       | Financing and leasing activities as well as maintenance activities regarding heavy commercial vehicles.                   | CapEx          |\n\n### SECTION 7: CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES\n\n• Minimum Social Safeguards: the company complies with the minimum social safeguards as defined in the Taxonomy framework.\n\nThis process started with an extensive review of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the corresponding documents in order to fully understand the subtleties of each criterion. In the following, a systematic approach was applied to collect relevant data on the economic activities to be assessed. These data comprise a wide range of factors, including but not limited to environmental key performance indicators, energy efficiency key performance indicators and compliance with established sustainability standards.\n\nThe DNSH principle states that economic activities classified as environmentally sustainable may not significantly harm any other environmental objective stated in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Therefore, each economic activity defined by the Taxonomy is to be thoroughly assessed in order to ensure compliance with DNSH.\n\nWe have started an extensive assessment of the criteria for classification as taxonomy-aligned. This includes assessing technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria including climate risk and vulnerability analysis as well as minimum social safeguards. We do not comply with the relevant technical screening criteria for classification as taxonomy-aligned for any of the stated activities and KPIs. Therefore, we do not report any taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the business year 2023/24.\n\nActivity 7.3: Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n\ndoors;\n\n- installation and replacem\n\n| The activity consists in one of the following individual<br>measures (...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | CapEx |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| - addition of insulation to existing envelope components, such as<br>external walls (including green walls), roofs (including green roofs),<br>lofts, basements and ground floors (including measures to ensure<br>air-tightness, measures to reduce the effects of thermal bridges and<br>scaffolding) and products for the application of the insulation to the<br>building envelope (including mechanical fixings and adhesive);

EU-TAXONOMY\n\n#### **6.3.TURNOVER**\n\nThe Delegated Act (EU) 2023/2485 added further environmental objectives in the tax year 2023/2024. This results in mEUR 7,73 taxonomy-eligible turnover in the economic sector \"2.1. Hotels, holiday parks, camping sites and similar accommodations\". The financial development of DO & CO Aktiengesellschaft in the business year 2023/2024 is detailed in the consolidated financial statements. Turnover reported pursuant to the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1.82 (a) as adopted in the Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2008 of the Commission, are presented in the consolidated income statement under item \"7.1 Revenue\". This turnover includes sales of products and services as well as intangible assets relating to taxonomy-eligible economic activities as share in total revenue. The denominator of the turnover key performance indicator is composed of consolidated net turnover on group level including income from the sale of products and services as well as intangible assets, excluding rebates, discounts and similar deductions. The numerator of the ratio includes turnover from merchandise and services as well as intangible assets related to taxonomy-eligible economic activities. By applying activity 2.1 to turnover and the resulting new reporting, this this key performance indicator was assessed more in detail during calculation, while the underlying collection process remained unchanged. Pursuant to Article 5 (6) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 in connection with the Disclosures Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, the group has opted for the phase-in option for the business year 2023/24. This means that taxonomy-eligible turnover is not checked for classification as taxonomy-aligned which is why no taxonomy-aligned turnover is reported.\n\n|     | TURNOVER SHARE / TOTAL TURNOVER |                                 |\n|-----|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned per objective  | Taxonomy-eligible per objective |\n| CCM | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| CCA | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| WTR | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| CE  | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| PPC | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| BIO | 0,00%                           | 0,43%                           |\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/5 description: A table is set with a multi-tiered tray of food and drinks, including pastries, cheese, and fruit, with glasses of juice and water.

It includes a table that breaks down taxonomy-eligible CapEx additions by economic activity, listing activities such as transport by motorbikes and freight transport services. The table also provides the total numerator in MEUR for each activity, with values like 5.35 for transport by motorbikes and 8.35 for freight transport services. Additionally, there is a section on CapEx share/total CapEx, showing taxonomy-aligned and eligible percentages for various categories, such as CCM, CCA, WTR, CE, PPC, and BIO.\n\nCapEx of the business year 2023/2024 has mainly changed through the increase in additions to assets in the course of construction. This increase results from the expansion of the business lines due to acquiring new customers especially in the Airline Catering division and the International Event Catering division in the US.\n\nWe have improved the collection process through more precise inquiries and more detailed data collecting by deepening the\n\n## I.ENVIRONMENT 6.

EU-TAXONOMY\n\n#### **6.5.OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES OPEX**\n\nThe denominator includes direct not capitalised costs relating to research and development, renovation measures for buildings, short-term rental agreements, maintenance and repair as well as all other direct expenses relating to ongoing maintenance of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThese expenditures can be made by the organisation itself or outsourced to third parties in order to ensure continuous and efficient operation of assets, in this case cleaning costs. The numerator represents the share of operational expenditures in the denominator which relates to assets or processes in connection with taxonomy-orientated economic activities and direct not capitalised costs for research and development. Pursuant to the EU Taxonomy, operational expenditures not significant for the company's business model are not to be considered. The denominator of the operational expenditures was calculated pursuant to the above description and amounts to in total mEUR 46,39 . The numerator was not broken down in detail by economic sectors due to materiality reasons, since pursuant to the EU Taxonomy OpEx is not significant for DO & CO's business model. We consider the OpEx denominator as not significant compared to the previous year for the first time, due to a more detailed calculation method and a different approach.\n\nThe insignificance was assessed in qualitative terms as well as in terms of quantity. In qualitative terms, our operational expenditures are not a significant part of our business model.

They form the bedrock of our operations, shaping a singular customer experience synonymous with excellence and ensuring sustainable growth.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/7 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of a delivery truck. The truck has a rectangular cargo area and a cab with a visible windshield and side window. The truck has four wheels, two on each side. The drawing is in a light green color and is contained within a square frame with rounded corners, also in light green.\n\n#### **NAVIGATING A DYNAMIC SUSTAINABILITY LANDSCAPE**\n\nThis report highlights our commitment to Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) issues. We meet evolving regulations, establishing a solid foundation for broader sustainability efforts. It details our adherence to specific ESG regulations and implemented actions – a significant step on our journey. Compliance is crucial and sets the bedrock for development. We are actively looking forward to upcoming regulation and exploring improvement and integration areas through frameworks like Environmental Management Systems (\"EMS\", ISO14001), CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), and EcoVadis. Using current and future frameworks and legislation as the core we are setting strong foundations for more efficient improvement.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/10 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of two people and a stack of money inside a rounded square. The people are depicted with smiling faces. One person is wearing a tie. The stack of money is in the lower left corner of the square. The drawing is in light green, and the square has a dark green border.\n\n#### **THE TWIN TRANSITION: BUSINESS EXCELLENCE SOLUTIONS**\n\nTo enable efficient and effective implementation of legislation and frameworks while ensuring sustainable growth, DO & CO embraces the Twin Transition. This approach involves transitioning to a more digital world and a more sustainable one simultaneously. The Twin Transition aligns digital strategies with sustainability strategies, creating a synergy that amplifies improvements, drives productivity, supports business development, and identifies risk areas.\n\nThe effectiveness and development of cross-departmental programs such as the Twin Transition are key motivators for us to continue embedding sustainability into our operations. By aligning IT and Sustainability strategies with business optimization, we enhance the measurement, monitoring, and continual improvement of both environmental aspects and critical business processes.\n\nTraditional sustainability, as defined in the 1987 \"Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future\", remains a core principle, focusing on meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Digital solutions act as powerful accelerators in this context. The \"sweet spot\" is where digital solutions and sustainability efforts enhance each other. By leveraging the amplification effect of the Twin Transition, DO & CO aims to improve productivity, support operations, and identify risk areas more effectively. nagement plans and the use of responsibly grown local produce. DO & CO embraces this challenge and sees it as an opportunity to partner more closely with our customers. We are eager to support these evolving needs and exceed expectations. Through collaboration, we can deliver exceptional experiences while minimizing environmental impact.\n\nFor instance, For instance, our integrated digital systems are enabling the real-time tracking of energy consumption, together with our expansion of our renewable energy focus leading to a 33% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions over the past year. Additionally, cross-functional teams collaborate closely to innovate solutions that streamline operations and reduce resource use, such as automated systems that adjust energy usage based on real-time data.\n\n#### **A GROWING TREND: SUSTAINABLE EVENTS**\n\nA growing trend is the demand for sustainable or eco events, with customers increasingly requesting information about a project's carbon footprint, the social impact of meals, waste ma-\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/20 description: A chef is carefully plating a dish with a spoon.

The background is a commercial kitchen with stainless steel appliances and equipment.\n\nTHE DO & CO STRATEGY Team innovation and departmental leadership play a crucial role in championing these initiatives, fostering a culture that values sustainability and technological advancement. Achieving business excellence while minimizing environmental impact becomes straightforward—a touch of a button allows us to track and optimize these efforts efficiently. This integrated approach ensures that we not only meet regulatory requirements but also drive industry standards, preparing and improving benchmarks for sustainable business practices.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE DO & CO STRATEGY\n\n#### **THE CHALLENGE OF EU WASTE REGULATIONS**\n\nAdding to the complexity in airline catering is the disparity in managing catering waste due to EU legislation. While catering waste within the EU can be efficiently processed, reused, and recycled, stricter rules apply to waste generated on flights outside the EU, hindering these efforts. We advocate and support our customers and industry colleagues in their call for simplifying and harmonizing cabin waste regulations while supporting the development of circular economy solutions.\n\n#### **HOSPITALITY AT ITS CORE: CULTIVATING TALENT FROM WITHIN**\n\nDO & CO transcends serving food, we cultivate experiences. We create unforgettable moments of excellence, and joy. Knowing guests remember how we make them feel fuels our pursuit of surpassing expectations and exceptional quality. We meticulously assemble a diverse team specific to each event, empowering them to consistently achieve the extraordinary. Maintaining this standard is our art form, and we proudly welcome back seasoned service professionals' event after event.\n\nIn addition to the delivery of exquisite cuisine, the heart of our service is the unmatched guest experience delivered by our front-of-house team. Their global event experience ensures we surpass even the most intricate client needs. Cultural agility and multilingual communication nurtures deeper connections, enabling personalized service. Strategic leadership and a profound understanding of the DO & CO ethos empower our team to exemplify excellence, efficiency, and seamless collaboration. This synergy of international and local expertise guarantees flawless event execution, upholding the impeccable DO & CO brand.\n\n#### **INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE: GROWTH CULTURE**\n\nUnderstanding and embracing our core values of service and the art of cultivating experiences empowers individuals to develop and thrive within our company. True hospitality and teamwork remain industry cornerstones. We prioritize fostering and promoting internal talent, creating a dynamic environment that encourages exploration, knowledge expansion, and pushing boundaries at all levels. This commitment is reflected in the fact that a significant portion of our executive team rose through the ranks of DO & CO, from starting in summer jobs or joining our mid-level teams and advancing to oversee unit and event operations globally. By investing in our people's growth, we empower them to shape the company's future alongside experienced mentors.\n\n#### **A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE**\n\nOur long-term objectives include achieving ISO 14001 alignment globally and adopting eco-labelling/green event frameworks and offerings, as requested by customers. While we build this foundation, we are confident in our progress towards a sustainable future.\n\nThis report details the complexities we face and the actions we are taking to ensure a sustainable future where exceptional culinary experiences go together with environmental and social responsibility.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/12 description: A high-angle, close-up shot captures a culinary creation presented on a white plate.

The lighting is bright and highlights the textures and colors of the food, making it visually appealing. The background is a mix of white and a light green design, which provides a clean and modern aesthetic.\n\n## CONSCIOUS GOURMET ENTERTAINMENT\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n# DO & CO BUSINESS MODEL\n\n[ GRI 2-1, GRI 2-6 ]\n\n#### **GLOBAL REACH**\n\nDO & CO's commitment to outstanding services extends around the world. Our strategic locations are spread across three continents and are constantly expanding. Together with a network of 33 gourmet kitchens, we guarantee our global clientele unparalleled reach and unsurpassed quality.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/9 description: The image shows a collection of design sketches and two physical objects.

The text in the image includes phrases like \"Dimensions,\" \"Form,\" \"Metal,\" \"Possible logo,\" and \"Olive access.\" There are also handwritten notes with measurements and technical details. The two physical objects are dark, oval-shaped trays or containers, one positioned at the top and the other at the bottom of the image. The overall composition suggests a design process, from initial sketches to physical prototypes.\n\n#### **INNOVATION AT OUR CORE**\n\nInnovation is the beating heart of DO & CO. We dedicate significant resources to research and development, constantly refining service concepts with a focus on elevated meal experiences, pioneering packaging solutions, and the design of innovative equipment and tableware.\n\n#### **GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS**\n\nDiverse Divisions, a cornerstone of the DO & CO experience, operates under a comprehensive business model encompassing three core divisions: 1) Airline Catering, 2) International Event Catering, and 3) Restaurants, Lounges & Hotels. Each division plays a vital role in solidifying our presence within the hospitality industry.\n\nThe majority of our revenue, approximately 76%, is generated through our renowned airline catering services. We take immense pride in serving major carriers such as Turkish Airlines, British Airways, Iberia, Austrian Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and over 50 others. As part of our steadfast commitment to sustainability, we work closely with our customers to offer a wider range of sustainable options, including an increased focus on plant-based products. This collaborative approach enables us to contribute to a more environmentally conscious airline industry whilst delivering exceptional culinary experiences to passengers.\n\n> DO & CO maintains its impressive growth trajectory, achieving a **28.2%** revenue increase for the second year in a row, reaching EUR 1.82 billion in revenue. The focus shifted from pandemic recovery to long-term profitability, boosting the EBIT margin to 7.5% and setting the company as an industry leader. Financial strength is evident with increased cash reserves and a reduced debt ratio. Share prices soared, and a dividend **of EUR 1.5 per share** is projected. Earnings reached record highs, though impacted by accounting regulations in Türkiye.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/12 description: The photograph captures the interior of a sophisticated restaurant or lounge area, characterized by its modern design and warm lighting.

This ranges from providing catering to prestigious international events like the F1 (Formula 1) Grands Prix, UEFA Champions League and European Cup matches, Mutua Madrid Open Tennis Tournament, and providing support for smaller scale events for them to achieve local Ecolabel certifications. The remaining portion of our revenue is derived from our acclaimed restaurants, lounges, and hotels.\n\nWe emphasize sourcing high quality products with preference for local and ethically produced ingredients, actively minimising food waste, and fostering awareness of our resource footprint among our valued guests. By offering an exceptional dining experience that aligns with sustainable principles, we contribute to a more conscious and responsible approach to hospitality. As stated, our key revenue stream is the delivery of gourmet culinary & entertainment services.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/6 description: A man is sitting in an airplane seat and eating a meal.

DO & CO has achieved sustainable revenue growth and increased profitability, with a focus on long-term profitability in the fiscal year 2023/2024. To further strengthen stakeholder relationships and drive continuous improvement, we have intensified sustainability reporting. We utilize leading standards like:\n\n- GRI\n- CDP\n- MSCI\n- Sustainalytics\n- ISS\n- Refinitiv\n- CSA-SP\n- EcoVadis (Bronze Certified)\n- ISO14001 framework for comprehensive reporting.\n\nIt is our firm conviction that setting targets in accordance with the SBTi criteria remains the optimal approach. We continue to uphold our commitment to Net-Zero by 2040. We are currently engaged in discussions with the SBTi to secure their approval of our targets during the next period. Concurrently, we are developing a different methodology for calculating emissions with the objective of enhancing the precision and reliability of our emission reports. The inherent complexity of calculations, particularly those pertaining to scope 3 emissions, has prompted us to re-examine our initial targets. The current lack of available solutions for evaluating scope 3 emissions, particularly Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions, has led us to undertake in-depth studies of our targets in the coming period. This will enable us to identify the resources required to achieve the stated goals.\n\n#### **MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe process to prepare and assess Environmental, Social and Governance issues begins by developing a survey intended to identify the key aspects with regard to sustainability within the Company. It refers to Environmental, Social and Governance issues and intends to identify key aspects. The questions were elaborated after a comprehensive analysis of standards as well as the evaluation of issues customary in the industry and benchmarking. Internal experts from various business lines were invited to take part in the survey and share their views. These employees work in areas such as General Management, the Human Resources department, the finance department, Quality Management, Sustainability Management, the IT department, procurement, and many more. Both internal experts and external stakeholders were chosen carefully, taking into account their significance to the Company and the depth of their insight into the business and the challenges. This selection ensures that both internal and external perspectives are reflected, adding value to our decision-making and strategic direction.\n\nInternal experts were chosen based on their in-depth knowledge of internal processes, workflows and structures. They have a unique perspective on the Company's targets as well as corporate values and culture and are able to provide deep insights based on first-hand experience. Their involvement enables us to precisely identify internal opportunities and challenges, and to develop customised solutions that are tailored to our specific needs.\n\nExternal stakeholders were chosen based on their relevance to and impact on the Company as well as their technical knowledge and expertise in relevant areas. These stakeholders include clients, suppliers, investors, and many more. Their perspectives are decisive in un-\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/16 description: A medium shot of the Demel bakery in Vienna, Austria, as seen through the window.

In addition, they give valuable insight into best practices, innovative solutions and future challenges.\n\nBy involving both internal experts and external stakeholders in our decision-making processes, we ensure a holistic and balanced approach to relevant topics and issues. Their different perspectives and experiences contribute to improving the quality of our decisions, mitigating risks and taking advantage of opportunities.\n\nIn the course of the surveys the participants were able to both make quantitative estimates and give qualitative answers. The key issues identified were elaborated and documented in the course of these surveys. They were asked to take into account the Company's environmental impact as well as the resulting consequences and the financial impact associated with this risk or opportunity. In the course of the surveying process to identify key Environmental, Social and Governance issues, internal experts and external stakeholders were involved to ensure a comprehensive and balanced evaluation. The analysis included all relevant aspects which were contemplated both from a qualitative and from a quantitative perspective.

It mentions the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with the goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement. The document also highlights the importance of monitoring direct and indirect emissions, engaging with partners to assess carbon emissions, and implementing sustainable practices. Additionally, it addresses the challenges and opportunities in the food and beverage sector due to climate change, as well as the company's efforts to improve transport efficiency and reduce food waste.\n\n[ GRI 305 – 1, GRI 305 – 2, GRI 305 – 4, GRI 305 – 5 ]\n\nWe recognise the complex and important connection between food systems and the planet's health. We also recognise the risk of climate change to our business and\n\n#### **1.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nThe global scientific community, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), recognizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as the primary driver of climate change. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures, declining air quality, and other detrimental effects on Earth's ecosystems. Given our global operations, we understand the impact we have on climate change. We are committed to re-evaluating our practices and aligning with the goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C.\n\nDemonstrative of this commitment, we joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023 and are actively developing ambitious, science-based, short-term to long-term targets for GHG reduction. However, our initial assessment lacked a level of granularity that is now necessary due to increase in business activities and to the complexity of our industry and supply chains in general. We recognise that the data and collection could be inclusive, therefore we have initiated a further deep dive to ensure a more comprehensive picture. To address this, we are implementing new software and monitoring frameworks to ensure accurate data collection and alignment with relevant benchmarks.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts, we are continuously improving the efficiency of our buildings and operating equipment. This includes implementing Environmental Management Systems (\"EMS\") and Building Energy Management Systems (\"BEMS\") to establish a solid foundation for accelerating GHG reduction.\n\nBeyond energy efficiency, we prioritize compliance with waste regulations and explore cost-reduction opportunities through waste minimization strategies. We recognize this as a crucial step on our journey to reducing our emissions. In addition to operational changes, we address climate change within our food systems, a significant source of emissions. We actively work to reduce food waste and prioritize offering local and seasonal\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/20 description: A person is holding a rectangular container filled with various foods, including hummus, salad, and vegetables. The container is made of a light-colored material, possibly cardboard or a similar eco-friendly material. The salad appears to have lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a white creamy dressing. The vegetables include roasted red peppers and zucchini. The person is holding a white plastic fork in their other hand, poised to eat the food. The person is wearing a colorful patterned shirt with a coral-colored sleeve and white pants. In the background, there is a woven basket and a white book, suggesting a picnic setting.\n\nproduce. This not only reduces our carbon footprint but ensures the freshest ingredients for our culinary creations.\n\nIt has become crucial to monitor and understand both our direct and indirect emissions, particularly those stemming from our primary production source – food. These emissions, especially those falling under the Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) categories, play a significant role in our environmental impact. While individual emissions may seem insignificant, their collective effect and impact is substantial. Thus, we recognize that even the smallest ingredient or quantity can contribute to our carbon footprint. Driven by this awareness, we actively engage with partners to assess the carbon emissions of our menus. This collaboration not only aids in evaluating emissions but also facilitates menu diversification, allowing us to offer customers options with varying CO2-e footprints. Furthermore, this initiative serves to educate and inform consumers about the environmental implications of their choices, empowering them to make more sustainable decisions.\n\nThe implementation of new transportation management systems both across our event business and in airports has improved transport efficiency and routing. In our airport segment we have reduced transport time to and from the aircraft, saving waiting times, minimising delays, and reducing our emissions.\n\nIn the food and beverage sector, companies like DO & CO face distinct challenges, risks, and opportunities because of shifting climatic conditions. Climate change poses a significant test for our business, given our high reliance on external environmental factors. For instance, climate-related disruptions can jeopardize our suppliers and events may be interrupted, postponed, or cancelled due to extreme weather events. It is also important to note the growing customer and stakeholder consciousness for products and services that are climate sensitive.\n\nare creating opportunities to ensure a strong business as well as a strong planet – extending our quality without compromising our planet.\n\nThe volatility in weather patterns, leading to events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, can disrupt agricultural supply chains, impacting the availability and quality of ingredients essential for our culinary offerings. To mitigate these risks, we must ensure our products align with seasonal variations. Local sourcing has been a cornerstone of our operations since our inception, reflecting our commitment to fresh, high-quality foods. This practice ensures product freshness and reduces transportation-related emissions, contributing to a more sustainable cycle.\n\nFurthermore, by sourcing locally, we honour and celebrate the countries where we host events, reinforcing our dedication to local communities. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events present operational challenges across our global facilities. Heat stress affects employee productivity and safety, while infrastructure damage from storms or flooding disrupts production and distribution, leading to delays and increased costs. As consumer awareness of climate change grows, there is a rising demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly products and services. DO & CO must adapt its offerings, accordingly, incorporating locally sourced ingredients, minimizing food waste, and introducing plant-based options into menus.\n\nAmidst these challenges lie opportunities for innovation. Investing in sustainable practices, such as renewable energy, waste reduction, and eco-friendly packaging, can differentiate DO & CO in the market and attract environmentally conscious customers. By positioning ourselves as leaders in environmental responsibility, we want to capitalize on emerging market opportunities, expand our customer base, and strengthen our competitive advantage. All whilst contributing to the ongoing need for increarise and extreme events become more frequent, our research informs proactive measures to mitigate potential disruptions. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, we aim to significantly reduce our GHG emissions and contribute meaningfully to global climate change mitigation efforts. We recognize the ongoing challenge of data collection and continuous improvement, and we are committed to investing in necessary resources and technologies to achieve our ambitious goals.\n\nsed corporate environmental responsibility. Our efforts in implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) and adhering to the EU Taxonomy have provided quantitative insights into the effects of climate change across our operations. This enables us to anticipate future risks anddevelop strategies to address them effectively. As temperatures In conclusion, climate change presents multifaceted challenges and opportunities for DO & CO, affecting our supply chain, operations, financial performance, and brand reputation. By proactively addressing climate risks, embracing sustainable practices, and seizing market opportunities, we can navigate the complexities of a changing climate while creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.1.2.

Emissions intensity, Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) related, measured by revenue, shows a notable change from last year, the intensity factors dropped by 43% for the intensity per revenue. This is despite experiencing business growth and adding new locations. It is important to note that improved reporting methods may have contributed to this reduction.\n\nWhile we have implemented energy-efficient systems and waste management improvements, further analysis is needed to fully isolate the impact of these initiatives. We remain committed to following the GHG Protocol guidelines. We utilize a mixed consumption/spend-based methodology, consistent with prior reports.\n\nFor the current business year, Scope 3 emissions were not calculated using the previously applied method as the software used\n\n#### **1.2.ENERGY CONSUMPTION**\n\n[ GRI 302 – 1, GRI 302 – 3, GRI 302 – 4 ]\n\nEnergy consumption defined here includes both direct energy use (e.g., electricity for lighting and appliances) and indirect energy use (e.g., the energy used to manufacture and transport the goods and services we use). Our goal is to address both sides of the equation, with a focus on expanding our reliance on renewable energy. We are happy to report that we have expanded our renewable electricity reliance to approximately 75% across our operations in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Türkiye.\n\nFurther rollout of EMS allows us to gain a clearer understanding of our overall energy consumption and plan for continual improvement. By pinpointing areas of greatest energy use, we can prioritize targeted efficiency upgrades. This focus on reduction complements our strong belief in transitioning to renewable resources. However, we recognize that renewable energy alone is not the sole solution. In our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, we also address the efficiency of our buildings and operating equipment.\n\n#### **1.2.1. STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nEnergy consumption at DO & CO has significant implications across various aspects of our operations, affecting our environmental footprint, operational efficiency, financial performance, regulatory compliance, stakeholder relations, and overall reputation.\n\n### **EMPOWERING PEOPLE, PROTECTING THE PLANET,**  BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nThese efforts are further supported by the development of Building Energy Management Systems across key units with our EMS, working on monitoring and measuring activities with improvements in our building management systems (another example of Twin Transition strategy). Through the improvement of our BEMS, we are unlocking and increasing our decarbonisation efforts. By using the system to identify leakage areas of our most intense zones, we are taking actions such as the addition of cold room door curtains to maintain temperature. We have seen how simple techniques like this, to the dashboarding and live monitoring of high usage equipment, drives both business and environmental improvements. In the access areas of our units, we are monitoring our consumption and piloting various energy controls as well as putting in place simple and practical solutions such as fridge curtains and sensors on high energy usage machinery. In addition to this and as a contributor to minimizing our transportation environmental impact and future emissions, we are working to develop and improve two specific solutions. Firstly, we are improving our utilisation of local storage instead of shipping materials and goods from global events back to a central location, significantly reducing transportation distances and associated emissions. Secondly, our Transport Management Systems are optimizing routing and minimizing vehicle standstill times at our airline locations, leading to savings in fuel and potential delays.\n\nfor it is no longer available. To ensure our report's consistency, we decided to still report on our Scope 3 emissions on a simplified and estimated basis as follows. For the current business year, we report our Scope 3 emissions based on the number of meals handed out during the reporting period. In doing so, we have calculated an emissions factor based on emissions per meal for 2022/2023 and applied to the most recent number of meals.\n\nThis method resulted in an increase of emissions by 14%. This assumption is based on simple clarity and the fact that our structure and activities taken into account within Scope 3 have not changed materially. We are currently revising our calculation methodology and assume we will be able to provide a more exact overview next year.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n| INDICATOR                                                      | RESULT             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total energy consumption<br>(renewable and non-renewable)      | 952,301,901.76 MJ  |\n| Total energy consumption<br>(renewable)                        | 496,516,842.45 MJ  |\n| Total energy consumption<br>(non-renewable)                    | 455,785,059.31 MJ  |\n| Energy intensity per EUR revenues                              | 0.53 MJ/EUR        |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(renewable and non-renewable) | 260,834,704.38 kWh |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(renewable)                   | 116,917,977.10 kWh |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(non-renewable)               | 143,916,727.28 kWh |\n| Electricity intensity per EUR revenue                          | 0.15 kWh/EUR       |\n| Number of vehicles                                             | 1,043              |\n| Number of conventional vehicles                                | 1,029              |\n| Number of e-vehicles                                           | 7                  |\n| Number of hybrid vehicles                                      | 7                  |\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/4 description: The image shows a world map made of trees and water.

The trees are dense and varied, creating a textured and natural look. The water is calm and reflective, adding to the serene and peaceful atmosphere of the image. The overall effect is one of harmony between nature and geography, highlighting the importance of trees and water in shaping our world.\n\n#### **1.2.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nDue to exponential business growth in the last year, we have seen an increase of energy consumption. However, despite this growth we have significantly increased our reliance on renewable electricity, reaching 45% usage levels, (in the previous year, we only consumed 21 % of our electricity from renewable energy sources). This is mostly due to several units switching to fully renewable contracts, including in Spain, Austria, Türkiye, and\n\nUK. Many of our other units are increasing their proportion of renewable as the availability allows. We see an active increase in electricity intensity per revenue, which can be attributed to an expansion of units. As our new units settle into regular working, energy audits become more regular. And as energy management is developed, we will see shift to a more positive energy\n\n### reduction. I.ENVIRONMENT 2.E2 POLLUTION\n\n#### **2.1.WASTE**\n\n[ GRI 306 – 1, GRI 306 – 2, GRI 306 – 3 ]\n\nAs a global catering company, we divide our waste reporting into three categories, each requiring a specific management approach throughout our production lines. We prioritize the waste hierarchy principles, with prevention always taking precedence. With the help of proprietary digital solutions, we continually monitor, measure, and improve our processes to ensure proper sorting, recycling, or disposal, of waste responsibly and sustainably.\n\n#### **2.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\n.The first category is production waste, which includes waste generated during the preparation of meals and beverages for our airline, event, and restaurant customers. This waste consists of materials such as food scraps, packaging materials, and other non-hazardous materials that result from our production operations. The second category of waste is non-hazardous waste generated from the packaging and serving of meals and beverages on our returning domestic flights. This waste is typically comprised of materials such as plastic cutlery, food packaging, paper products, and plastic bottles. The third category of waste is hazardous waste generated from international flights. This waste includes items such as food residues, packaging and other materials that may pose a risk to human health or the environment if not handled properly. We have increased our waste management planning and reporting across all our activities, with additional improvements following this year. Post-event waste reports are produced after all events and reduction/prevention topics are covered in the event debrief. Across airline catering units we are improving our waste tracking from store to delivery, using bespoke software to connect all sections of our process to identify waste, cause, and work towards prevention. Cross unit working groups have identified departments that are still reliant on paper, and these are currently being digitalised\n\nWaste prevention is our focus. Where we cannot transform waste as a new resource (make circular) we look to packaging, which is sustainable and low impact, produced/designed for minimal environmental footprint. Our sustainability experts work closely with our industrial design specialists to ensure that our customers have the most suitable options available.\n\n(instead of paper, more work is now being carried out on tablets). Not only saving paper but moving to tablet usage, the teams on the ground can access the most up to date information. Again, another step-in process improvement, operational efficiency, and sustainability. It is proof that sustainability is not a silo, but an essential function for business excellence.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of the waste management hierarchy. The diagram is in the shape of a pyramid, with the largest section at the bottom and the smallest section at the top. The sections are labeled as follows, from top to bottom: PREVENTION, REUSE, RECYCLE, RECOVER, and DISPOSE.\n\n### WASTE HIERARCHY\n\n#### **PREVENTION**\n\nWithin our Twin Transition program, waste prevention is a key priority. A key aspect of this collaboration involves our IT team partnering with the Sustainability team to improve waste tracking throughout kitchen operations. This enhanced data provides valuable insights into areas with peak waste generation. By identifying these hotspots, we can implement preventive measures and continuously adapt our practices to minimize waste at the source. This focus on prevention is particularly important for our fresh produce. We achieve this by implementing just-intime deliveries, ensuring products are utilized at optimal quality. Additionally, there are regular meetings involving relevant stakeholders, such as kitchen staff and sustainability representatives, who review the week's waste data, pinpoint areas exceeding expectations, and collaborate to tackle the root causes. In our efforts to combat plastic waste, we have replaced plastic bottles with cold water fountains in a unit. This initiative alone\n\nis projected to save over 5,840 kilograms of plastic at a single medium-sized unit.\n\n#### **RECYCLE**\n\nWe collaborate with our airline partners to increase onboard waste recycling potential. Collection of onboard waste, sorting on board and reporting is now the industry standard. Regular checks take place to ensure that what can be is sorted appropriately. Continual improvement opportunities are evaluated and tested. We have seen in an increase in the availability of waste segregation possibility at events sites, a helpful and positive trend.\n\n#### **RECOVER**\n\nFood waste represents a sizeable portion of our overall waste stream. Because we know that it is imperative we reduce our environmental impact and critically, reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, we are exploring the option of food waste composting as a potential waste management solution. By composting our food waste, we can create a valuable resource for local agriculture while also reducing our overall waste footprint. We also use incineration to recover energy from our waste. While we recognise that this is not the ideal method of waste disposal, it is necessary for a sizeable portion of our waste due to regulatory requirements.\n\n#### **DISPOSE**\n\nAlthough this is our least preferred option, we still aim to dispose of waste in a responsible manner that minimises the environmental impact. We only dispose of waste materials that cannot be reduced, reused, or recycled, and we prioritise disposal methods that are the least harmful to the environment. As technology advances and regulations change, it will become easier to take advantage reduce our output and increase the proportion of materials that remain in the economic loop, limiting the need for the use of virgin resources, such as plastic, metal, paper, and glass.\n\n#### **RE – USE**\n\nWe have made a shift towards more rotatable products in our internal operations. As we operate in a premium segment, we are continually identifying opportunities to repurpose materials within our own operations, as well as exploring partnerships with other businesses or organisations that can make use of our waste materials.\n\nAt our events especially, we strive to minimise food waste and promote sustainability by carefully managing our food inventory and portions. In the event of surplus food, we donate these meals to local food banks, where possible. By responsibly donating any leftovers to local food banks, we support our local communities while also reducing food waste and promoting sustainability.\n\n#### **2.1.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nOur environmental management systems and controls are delivering results. We have significantly reduced total waste generation, down to 74,375 tonnes from 110,851 tonnes. This decrease applies to both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with a steeper decline (65%) in hazardous materials. Waste intensity per euro of revenue also dropped significantly 48%. Our core focus on prevention, increased separation across our locations and collaboration with our internal and external teams, are key factors.\n\n# Total waste generated 74,375.18 tonnes Total non-hazardous waste 56,318.31 tonnes Total hazardous waste 18,056.87 tonnes\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/17 description: A brown paper bag filled with food scraps sits on a light green surface.

Our commitment to responsible water use is a core element of our environmental strategy, reflected in\n\nour \"Use of Natural Resources\" policy. This policy contains strict regulations for the use of fresh water and includes the development of a water management strategy.\n\n#### **3.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nIn alignment with our EMS, we are working on a comprehensive water stewardship strategy focused on continuous improvement. We are implementing consistent water usage data collection across all operations, providing a clear picture of consumption patterns and areas for improvement. This data will directly inform future water management strategies that support our environmental goals.\n\nFurthermore, we are moving beyond reactive measures by proactively identifying and mitigating potential water risks like equipment failure or inefficient processes. The EMS facilitates a continual cycle of reviewing water use data, identifying improvement areas, and implementing corrective actions. This data-driven approach, informed by this framework's compliance considerations, will guide future investments in water-efficient technologies and processes. Ultimately, this strategy allows us to continuously improve water use efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance our brand image as a leader in environmental responsibility, positioning us well for the challenges and opportunities of water stewardship in the years to come.\n\n### **DO & CO AIMS TO CONTINUE TO INSPIRE OUR STAKEHOLDERS & CONTINUE ITS LONGSTANDING TRADITION OF BEING IN**\n\nthe forefront of innovation in the culinary, catering & event industry.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/17 description: A person wearing black gloves is washing a metal pot in a stainless steel sink.

While US locations achieved the best water intensity per revenue (under 0.10), further analysis through our enhanced systems is needed to understand the reasons behind the 8% withdrawal increase. This increase might be due to factors like increased business activity or expansion to new locations, requiring more water for facilities. With our planned environmental management systems rollout, we will see further improvement in recording the data and identifying areas for improvement.\n\n#### INDICATOR RESULT\n\nWater intensity by EUR revenue 1.84 litre/EUR\n\nWater withdrawal\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/11 description: A clear glass bottle and a wine glass filled with liquid are on a white table.

Due to this, natural processes such as pollination, seed dispersal and nutrient cycling are endangered. We recognise that healthy ecosystems are integral to a secure food system. As such we understand that we have the responsibility to safeguard our supply chain and products from practices that potentially disrupt ecosystem functioning and threaten a species' existence. To this aim, we are working with our customers to decrease the use of ingredients that are related to deforestation- and work towards the protection of both forests and peatland conversion. As we work to improve and verify our supply chain, and that of our customers, we prioritise sustainability certifications that ensure respect for biodiversity and animal welfare.\n\n#### **4.1.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nLocal sourcing is key to freshness and quality, we aim to source as much as possible in a radius of 500km from the event or established unit.\n\nThis year we have seen an increase of local sourcing across the board from 51% to 59%. Türkiye and Spain both boasting over 80% of local produce. With an increase in requests for environmentally conscious events and services, and with the availability fantastic artisanal local projects growing we expect this number to continue to increase.\n\nAs part of our sustainability efforts, we conducted a comprehensive risk mapping exercise for the main ingredients that we\n\n#### **4.1.ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOURCING**\n\nAt DO & CO one of our top priorities is to ensure that our sourcing practices are sustainable, both environmentally and socially. From an environmental perspective, we strive to minimise our carbon footprint by sourcing locally whenever possible, reducing unnecessary packaging and waste, and choosing suppliers who prioritise sustainable farming and fishing practices. From a social perspective, we believe in fair labour practices and supporting our local communities. This means working with our suppliers who prioritise fair wages, safe conditions, and ethical sourcing. We believe that by making conscious choices about our sourcing practices, we can create a positive impact on both the connected environment and the committees.\n\n#### **4.1.1. STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nIn the European Union, the United Kingdom and Türkiye operations, we define locally sourced as coming from producers under 500km radius of the unit or event. Our partnerships with local food producers complement our efforts to support economic development in all the communities in which we do business. At the same time, we are working with stakeholders across our value chain to actively promote better, more sustainable approaches to food production, consumption, and distribution, including discussions with customers, suppliers, and regulators. As our business practices integrate improved food resource efficiency, we open the door to enhanced positive environmental and social impact of our operations, as well as to productivity, cost management, and operational performance.\n\nHowever, we recognize there are potential downsides associated with sustainable local sourcing. Limited availability of local ingredients can impact menu options and potentially increase costs. Seasonal variations may require adjustments to menus, source. Our aim was to identify and prioritise the environmental and social risks associated with each ingredient, including human rights risks that are cross-cutting and apply to all our ingredients.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, we identified seven key risks that require immediate attention: emissions contribution,\n\ndeforestation and peatland conversion, marine conservation, GMO, antibiotics use, animal welfare and human rights. These risks were mapped against the ingredients in our supply chain, including beef, chicken and eggs, fish and seafood, soy, cacao, coffee, palm oil, and paper.\n\n| INDICATOR                      | RESULT |\n|--------------------------------|--------|\n| Locally sourced<br>ingredients | 59 %   |\n\nand ensuring consistent quality from local producers requires a strong focus on quality control. Scalability can also be a challenge as our business expands.\n\nThe truth remains that the opportunities presented by sustainable sourcing are significant. By promoting our commitment to responsible practices, we attract environmentally and socially conscious customers. Collaboration with local producers fosters innovation in menu development and sourcing strategies. Reduced transportation costs and potentially lower local prices can lead to significant savings. Furthermore, focusing on local and sustainable practices can mitigate risks associated with climate change and potential supply chain disruptions. Additionally, it helps to promote local businesses and stimulate the local economy.\n\nAs stated in our sustainable sourcing policy we seek to standardise our sourcing practices and ensure that human rights and environmental laws are engrained into our practices. To support these practices through a Supplier Code of Conduct in which we outline our expectations for suppliers regarding ethical and sustainable practices. The below metrics are aligned are policies and will be built on over the coming years, as we improve our supplier audits and tracking.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/19 description: The image shows the text \"59% LOCALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS\".

E5 CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nOur primary focus is on waste prevention, but in instances where prevention is not feasible, we are committed to transitioning into a circular company with an emphasis on sustainable waste management practices. Recognizing the significant resources utilized in our operations, particularly in terms of food products, it is important for us to conscientiously manage our waste output and take proactive measures to minimize it.\n\nWe echo the call by our aviation partners and IATA for the European Commission to reassess its approach, enabling the aviation sector to play a more proactive role in the circular economy by facilitating cabin waste prevention and reuse and recycling initiatives.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/14 description: The image shows three crushed blue plastic bottles against a white background with small tan flecks. One bottle is in the lower right corner, another is in the lower left, and the third is in the upper right.\n\nOur Sustainability and Quality Teams collaborate closely with industry partners and customers to address these challenges and explore innovative solutions that align with our and our customers sustainability goals. Waste prevention is our focus and where we cannot reinsert our waste as a new resource, in the case of international flights, we look to packaging which is sustainable and low impact produce/ designed for minimal environmental footprint. Our sustainability experts work closely with our industrial design specialists to ensure that our customers have the most suitable options available.\n\n### **5.1.FOOD AND PACKAGING WASTE**\n\n[ GRI 306 – 2 ]\n\nFood waste (the inedible parts removed from the human food supply chain) and packaging waste pose significant environmental and social challenges, impacting the Entire Resource Depletion Spectrum (ERDS). Food waste not only represents a loss of valuable resources used in its production (water, land, energy) but also contributes to GHG emissions. While often vital for food safety and preservation, packaging waste can strain resource availability and lead to pollution if not managed responsibly.\n\nAt DO & CO we are committed to minimizing food and packaging waste throughout our operations. Through these efforts, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint by minimizing resource depletion, GHG emissions, and potential pollution associated with food waste and inefficient packaging. Additionally, we promote social responsibility by contributing to a more sustainable food system that minimizes food insecurity and the environmental burdens placed on future generations. Ultimately, by optimizing resource utilization throughout the supply chain, we contribute to a more circular economy.\n\n#### **5.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nFood waste presents a significant environmental and social challenge. Discarded food represents a substantial loss of precious resources – water, land, and energy – used in its production. Furthermore, decomposition of wasted food generates greenhouse gases, accelerating climate change. The social impact is equally concerning. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation reports that 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food go to waste annually, equivalent to 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2. This wasted food could alleviate hunger and food insecurity.\n\nThe UN's Food and Agricultural Organization reports that, each year, the world wastes 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food, and this food waste generates an estimated 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses. In other words, food that could be preventing starvation is instead causing threats to the health of our planet and its inhabitants.\n\nWe recognize the importance of addressing food waste within our operations. Despite our efforts to carefully manage food inventory and portions at events, excess leftovers occasionally arise.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/12 description: The image shows a circular diagram with three sections, each containing text related to sustainability and recycling. The first section, colored in a muted green, contains the words \"CONSCIOUSLY CREATING\". Adjacent to this, there's a smaller section with the text \"FROM WASTE TO VALUE\" and a logo that appears to be \"DO&CO\". The second section, also in muted green, reads \"RECOVERY RECYCLE\". The third section, in a lighter shade of green, says \"REUSE REDISTRIBUTE\". The diagram is designed to represent a continuous cycle, suggesting a closed-loop system for waste management and resource utilization.\n\n### **FOOD WASTE**\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: This image shows two pages from the DO & CO sustainability report 2023/24. The left page has an image of a forest with a lake in the shape of an airplane. The right page has the following text: AIRLINES In our airline catering division waste management remains a complex topic. The current International Catering Waste (ICW) rules, driven by animal health concerns, present a challenge to the aviation catering sector's ability to contribute positively to the circular economy through cabin waste prevention, reuse, and recycling initiatives. While waste generated on flights operating within certain territorial borders or the EU can be efficiently processed, reused, and recycled, the same is not true for waste from international flights originating outside of those borders. (\"Towards Smarter Regulation of International Catering Waste - IATA Joint Statement 2022\") Passengers are increasingly concerned about the impact of cabin waste, notably single-use plastics (SUPs), while governments are focusing on minimizing food waste. In alignment with the sentiments expressed in the IATA report, we are actively engaged with our customers in advocating for a review of international catering waste regulations. EVENTS We are working with our event customers to donate any surplus to local charities, ensuring that nutritious food reaches those in need while mitigating waste. However, we acknowledge that food waste remains a significant component of our overall waste stream. In response, we are actively exploring the implementation of food waste composting as a viable waste management solution. By composting our food waste, we not only reduce landfill contributions but also generate a valuable resource for local agriculture. Most importantly, as part of a Twin Transition plan, we are enhancing our waste tracking processes through digitalization and predictive tooling, aiming to minimize food waste throughout our operations. CONCLUSION Despite these risks, significant opportunities exist to address food waste. By minimizing food waste throughout our operations, we can significantly reduce our environmental footprint. This translates to lower resource depletion, decreased GHG emissions, and minimized pollution associated with disposal of wasted food. Furthermore, by optimizing resource utilization throughout the supply chain, we contribute to a more sustainable food system. Reducing food waste also comes with economic benefits. Less wasted food translates to lower purchasing and disposal costs. Finally, minimizing waste can enhance operational efficiency. Digital tracking and prediction tools can improve inventory management and portion control, further reducing food waste generation. \\*(https://www.iata.org/contentassets/c81222d96c9a4e0bb4ff6ced0126fobb/annual-review-2023.pdf)\n\n#### **AIRLINES**\n\n#### **EVENTS**\n\n**In our airline catering** division waste management remains a complex topic.

That is why we prioritize lifelong learning and skill development for all our employees. We believe in empowering our diverse workforce across international business areas to evolve and excel in their careers.\n\n#### **7.4.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nOur approach to training combines engaging in-person learning workshops, online self-paced modules, and mentorship programs. This allows employees to learn at their own pace, work cross functionally, and opens up opportunities to connect with colleagues, and allows guidance from experienced mentors embeds our traditions and values.\n\nWe foster a culture of self-directed learning and advancement. Beyond the structured training programs, we encourage employees to take ownership of their professional development by supporting them in pursuing projects aligned with their interests and career goals, and by matching high performers with experienced mentors. This ensures the successful transfer of DO & CO traditions and visions, while fostering a culture of continuous learning.\n\nOur commitment to providing ongoing learning and skill development opportunities is integral to ensuring a safe and proficient workforce in the service industry. Through internal training programs, employees receive specialized instruction in culinary techniques, food safety practices, and customer service skills, enhancing their competency and ability to deliver high-quality service. Many of our employees have benefited from job rotations and in-house development opportunities, progressing significantly within the company, and exemplifying our commitment to developing career growth.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/9 description: Two chefs are preparing food outdoors.

The background shows trees and a blue sky.\n\n#### **7.4.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nWe are currently unable to provide precise data on training hours. Our aim is to avoid publishing inaccurate figures, so we will focus on obtaining accurate data in the near future. It is important to note that accurately recording training hours, especially on-the-job training, is a challenge. We are actively working on implementing a learning management system that will enable the recording and formalization of training. However, this figure will not be published for this reporting year due to the quality of the data.\n\nA key element of this approach is cross-functional job rotation. This allows employees to gain valuable experience in different areas of the business, expanding their skillsets and preparing them for future growth opportunities.\n\nWe cultivate a positive workplace culture by embracing a less hierarchical structure. We believe in open communication, collaboration, and empowering our team members to take ownership of their roles. This creates a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.\n\nDespite the positive impacts of our training initiatives, challenges such as inconsistency in delivery and inadequate resource allocation for training programs may nonetheless influence task effectiveness. However, we proactively address these challenges by providing regular updates and reminders to ensure compliance with the latest health and safety guidelines. By leveraging opportunities for progression, flexible development access through a combination of in-person and online learning, and a focus on cross-functional experiences, we aim to overcome challenges and maximize the positive impacts of our training initiatives on employee growth and career advancement.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/16 description: A group of people are standing in a room, holding papers and smiling.

From farmers and producers to distributors and delivery personnel, each one contributes to the seamless functioning of the supply chain. Recognizing the importance of these workers is not only essential for ethical considerations but also critical for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the industry. Ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and opportunities for professional growth across the value chain not only upholds human rights but also fosters trust and collaboration among stakeholders. Furthermore, prioritizing the well-being of workers in the value chain aligns with sustainability goals by promoting social responsibility and resilience within the industry. By valuing and supporting workers at every stage of the value chain, businesses can cultivate stronger relationships, mitigate risks, and contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food system.\n\n#### **8.1.SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SOURCING**\n\n[ GRI 414 – 1, ANGABE 2 – 6 ]\n\nSocially responsible sourcing is key for DO & CO. Prioritizing responsible sourcing practices ensures ethically produced products, minimizes negative community and environmental impacts, and upholds labour standards throughout the supply chain. Every facet of the sourcing process, from agricultural practices to ingredient sourcing and packaging, offers an opportunity to make socially and environmentally conscious decisions. Today's consumers seek transparency and accountability in the products they purchase, ethical accountability, inclusive of their impact on local communities and the environment. Sustainable sourcing practices, especially from local, small, and diverse suppliers, not only provide insight into market trends but also support authentic, culturally relevant products and services, driving overall satisfaction and contributing to the growth of the local economy.\n\n#### **8.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nWe take a comprehensive approach to ethical and environmental responsibility throughout our supply chain. We address key areas like human rights deforestation, animal welfare, and biodiversity and through our supplier code of conduct expect all our suppliers to adhere.\n\nWe prioritize sustainable sourcing, especially for high-impact products like beef and palm oil. Our goal is to eliminate deforestation and peatland conversion by 2030. Additionally, our sustainable sourcing policy emphasizes high animal welfare standards. For example, we are phasing out caged eggs and chickens across all our kitchens globally.\n\nCollaboration with our customers strengthens our efforts. We provide education and support to those who prioritize distinct aspects of their supply chain, such as offering menus with specific sustainability certifications or helping them track the origin of their food. Together, we ensure responsible and ethical sourcing, maintaining the high quality whether it is on an airline or at a sporting event.\n\nIn line with pending legislation, we are rolling out supply chain audits, starting in Germany under the LKSG (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtsgesetz) regulation (effective January 2023). This initiative will expand under the EU's recently passed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), although it may take several years to come into full force. However, we are committed to going beyond mere compliance. We believe the food supply chain is so crucial and delicate that we are prioritizing supply chain audits for the coming year. We hold our suppliers accountable for adhering to our code of conduct through a variety of measures, including audits and contractual agreements. We are committed to transparency and publish annual sustainability reports that detail our progress and goals.\n\nEnsuring sustainable and socially responsible sourcing practices is a key priority within our operations at DO & CO. We are committed to supporting fair labour practices and local communities by partnering with suppliers who prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and ethical sourcing. This deliberate approach not only contributes to positive environmental impacts by reducing transportation-related emissions through local sourcing but also fosters economic development within the communities we operate in.\n\nNavigating complex supply chains with multiple intermediaries and global networks underscores the importance of maintaining transparency and upholding ethical sourcing practices. This complexity emphasizes the need for robust systems and processes that ensure integrity throughout our sourcing operations. By implementing such measures, we empower ourselves to make informed decisions that align with our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nIn addition to addressing these supply chain challenges, we are dedicated to minimizing inefficiencies such as overproduction and food waste, which contribute to resource depletion and GHG emissions, exacerbating global food insecurity. Furthermore, our focus on sourcing from reputable suppliers with stringent quality standards reduces food safety risks, ensuring consumer health and safety. We prioritize consumer education on socially responsible sourcing practices and maintain transparency in our supply chain by tracing ingredient origins, taking accountability, and building trust with our consumers. Through these efforts, we not only uphold ethical standards but also make positive contributions to the environment and the communities we serve in the food and catering industry.\n\n#### **8.1.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nLocal sourcing is key to freshness and quality, we aim to source as much as possible in a radius of 500km from the event or established unit.

Environmental violations may lead to operational disruptions and increased costs, but proactive compliance efforts enhance business resilience and reputation, positioning companies as responsible stewards of the environment.\n\n#### **11.1.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\n| INDICATOR                                                     | RESULT     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Number of breaches with<br>environmental law                  | 1          |\n| Total cost of fines due to brea-<br>ches in environmental law | 15,000 EUR |\n\nOne of our sites (Italy) was in breach of an environmental law, as two out of ten prescribed parameter values were exceeded in our discharged water. In relative terms, this violation is minor, as eight out of ten parameter values were complied with. In the overall context of the company, this value can also be considered marginal. Nevertheless, we are aware that any non-compliance with environmental standards must be taken seriously. We are currently conducting a comprehensive analysis in order to gain a precise understanding of the causes of this variance. Based on the results of this analysis, we are implementing targeted measures to ensure that all parameters are complied with in future and that similar infringements are prevented.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## III.GOVERNANCE 11.G1 GOVERNANCE\n\n#### **11.2.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nDO & CO recognizes the critical importance of upholding high ethical standards and transparency in our business operations, particularly in combating corruption. We have maintained a strong track record of zero corruption cases, demonstrating our zero-tolerance approach towards any form of corrupt practices. Our comprehensive management approach is underpinned by robust anti-corruption policies designed to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including stringent anti-bribery measures. These policies are communicated to all employees to clarify and promote awareness of their obligations and responsibilities. Additionally, we have established a code of conduct for suppliers and business partners that articulates our ethical values and expectations, requiring their commitment to upholding these standards. We aim to achieve further transparency within our supply chain to strengthen accountability and mitigate corruption risks.\n\nAdhering to anti-corruption practices not only enhances compliance and risk management, reducing legal and regulatory risks associated with bribery and corruption, but also safeguards against penalties and reputational harm. Our initiatives foster operational efficiency and cost savings through improved transparency in financial transactions and procurement processes, mitigating the risk of fraud or resource misuse. Our commitment to ethical behaviour strengthens business relationships, promoting integrity and trust with customers, suppliers, and partners, thereby facilitating fair competition and collaboration.\n\nThe risks associated with failure to uphold anti-corruption standards, are effectively addressed through a pro-active approach. By prioritizing transparency and integrity, we mitigate legal and regulatory repercussions, ensuring compliance and protecting our reputation. Combatting corruption leads to streamlined operations, reducing inefficiencies that could divert funds from legitimate activities and enhancing market competitiveness.\n\nEmbracing ethical practices also bolsters investor confidence, opening doors to reputable partnerships and investment opportunities. In this way, maintaining a steadfast commitment to anti-corruption measures not only safeguards our operations but also paves the way for sustainable growth and success in the food and catering industry.\n\n#### **11.3.DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION** [ GRI 418 – 1 ]\n\nDO & CO IT systems are globally connected; therefore, it is necessary to report the response to this requirement from a global information systems context with some localisation as required.\n\n#### **11.3.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nDO & CO has recorded no data breaches or breaches of customer privacy in 2023/24, as indicated in the table below.

The truck has a rectangular cargo area and a cab with a visible windshield and side window. The truck has four wheels, two on each side. The drawing is in a light green color and is contained within a square frame with rounded corners, also in light green.\n\n#### **NAVIGATING A DYNAMIC SUSTAINABILITY LANDSCAPE**\n\nThis report highlights our commitment to Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) issues. We meet evolving regulations, establishing a solid foundation for broader sustainability efforts. It details our adherence to specific ESG regulations and implemented actions – a significant step on our journey. Compliance is crucial and sets the bedrock for development. We are actively looking forward to upcoming regulation and exploring improvement and integration areas through frameworks like Environmental Management Systems (\"EMS\", ISO14001), CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), and EcoVadis. Using current and future frameworks and legislation as the core we are setting strong foundations for more efficient improvement.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/10 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of two people and a stack of money inside a rounded square. The people are depicted with smiling faces. One person is wearing a tie. The stack of money is in the lower left corner of the square. The drawing is in light green, and the square has a dark green border.\n\n#### **THE TWIN TRANSITION: BUSINESS EXCELLENCE SOLUTIONS**\n\nTo enable efficient and effective implementation of legislation and frameworks while ensuring sustainable growth, DO & CO embraces the Twin Transition. This approach involves transitioning to a more digital world and a more sustainable one simultaneously. The Twin Transition aligns digital strategies with sustainability strategies, creating a synergy that amplifies improvements, drives productivity, supports business development, and identifies risk areas.\n\nThe effectiveness and development of cross-departmental programs such as the Twin Transition are key motivators for us to continue embedding sustainability into our operations.

Digital solutions act as powerful accelerators in this context. The \"sweet spot\" is where digital solutions and sustainability efforts enhance each other. By leveraging the amplification effect of the Twin Transition, DO & CO aims to improve productivity, support operations, and identify risk areas more effectively. nagement plans and the use of responsibly grown local produce. DO & CO embraces this challenge and sees it as an opportunity to partner more closely with our customers. We are eager to support these evolving needs and exceed expectations. Through collaboration, we can deliver exceptional experiences while minimizing environmental impact.\n\nFor instance, For instance, our integrated digital systems are enabling the real-time tracking of energy consumption, together with our expansion of our renewable energy focus leading to a 33% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions over the past year.

This integrated approach ensures that we not only meet regulatory requirements but also drive industry standards, preparing and improving benchmarks for sustainable business practices.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE DO & CO STRATEGY\n\n#### **THE CHALLENGE OF EU WASTE REGULATIONS**\n\nAdding to the complexity in airline catering is the disparity in managing catering waste due to EU legislation. While catering waste within the EU can be efficiently processed, reused, and recycled, stricter rules apply to waste generated on flights outside the EU, hindering these efforts. We advocate and support our customers and industry colleagues in their call for simplifying and harmonizing cabin waste regulations while supporting the development of circular economy solutions.\n\n#### **HOSPITALITY AT ITS CORE: CULTIVATING TALENT FROM WITHIN**\n\nDO & CO transcends serving food, we cultivate experiences.

Their global event experience ensures we surpass even the most intricate client needs. Cultural agility and multilingual communication nurtures deeper connections, enabling personalized service. Strategic leadership and a profound understanding of the DO & CO ethos empower our team to exemplify excellence, efficiency, and seamless collaboration. This synergy of international and local expertise guarantees flawless event execution, upholding the impeccable DO & CO brand.\n\n#### **INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE: GROWTH CULTURE**\n\nUnderstanding and embracing our core values of service and the art of cultivating experiences empowers individuals to develop and thrive within our company. True hospitality and teamwork remain industry cornerstones. We prioritize fostering and promoting internal talent, creating a dynamic environment that encourages exploration, knowledge expansion, and pushing boundaries at all levels. This commitment is reflected in the fact that a significant portion of our executive team rose through the ranks of DO & CO, from starting in summer jobs or joining our mid-level teams and advancing to oversee unit and event operations globally. By investing in our people's growth, we empower them to shape the company's future alongside experienced mentors.\n\n#### **A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE**\n\nOur long-term objectives include achieving ISO 14001 alignment globally and adopting eco-labelling/green event frameworks and offerings, as requested by customers. While we build this foundation, we are confident in our progress towards a sustainable future.\n\nThis report details the complexities we face and the actions we are taking to ensure a sustainable future where exceptional culinary experiences go together with environmental and social responsibility.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/12 description: A high-angle, close-up shot captures a culinary creation presented on a white plate.

We take immense pride in serving major carriers such as Turkish Airlines, British Airways, Iberia, Austrian Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and over 50 others. As part of our steadfast commitment to sustainability, we work closely with our customers to offer a wider range of sustainable options, including an increased focus on plant-based products.

Financial strength is evident with increased cash reserves and a reduced debt ratio. Share prices soared, and a dividend **of EUR 1.5 per share** is projected. Earnings reached record highs, though impacted by accounting regulations in Türkiye.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/12 description: The photograph captures the interior of a sophisticated restaurant or lounge area, characterized by its modern design and warm lighting.

DO & CO has achieved sustainable revenue growth and increased profitability, with a focus on long-term profitability in the fiscal year 2023/2024. To further strengthen stakeholder relationships and drive continuous improvement, we have intensified sustainability reporting. We utilize leading standards like:\n\n- GRI\n- CDP\n- MSCI\n- Sustainalytics\n- ISS\n- Refinitiv\n- CSA-SP\n- EcoVadis (Bronze Certified)\n- ISO14001 framework for comprehensive reporting.\n\nIt is our firm conviction that setting targets in accordance with the SBTi criteria remains the optimal approach. We continue to uphold our commitment to Net-Zero by 2040. We are currently engaged in discussions with the SBTi to secure their approval of our targets during the next period. Concurrently, we are developing a different methodology for calculating emissions with the objective of enhancing the precision and reliability of our emission reports. The inherent complexity of calculations, particularly those pertaining to scope 3 emissions, has prompted us to re-examine our initial targets. The current lack of available solutions for evaluating scope 3 emissions, particularly Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions, has led us to undertake in-depth studies of our targets in the coming period. This will enable us to identify the resources required to achieve the stated goals.\n\n#### **MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe process to prepare and assess Environmental, Social and Governance issues begins by developing a survey intended to identify the key aspects with regard to sustainability within the Company. It refers to Environmental, Social and Governance issues and intends to identify key aspects. The questions were elaborated after a comprehensive analysis of standards as well as the evaluation of issues customary in the industry and benchmarking. Internal experts from various business lines were invited to take part in the survey and share their views. These employees work in areas such as General Management, the Human Resources department, the finance department, Quality Management, Sustainability Management, the IT department, procurement, and many more. Both internal experts and external stakeholders were chosen carefully, taking into account their significance to the Company and the depth of their insight into the business and the challenges. This selection ensures that both internal and external perspectives are reflected, adding value to our decision-making and strategic direction.\n\nInternal experts were chosen based on their in-depth knowledge of internal processes, workflows and structures. They have a unique perspective on the Company's targets as well as corporate values and culture and are able to provide deep insights based on first-hand experience. Their involvement enables us to precisely identify internal opportunities and challenges, and to develop customised solutions that are tailored to our specific needs.\n\nExternal stakeholders were chosen based on their relevance to and impact on the Company as well as their technical knowledge and expertise in relevant areas. These stakeholders include clients, suppliers, investors, and many more. Their perspectives are decisive in un-\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/16 description: A medium shot of the Demel bakery in Vienna, Austria, as seen through the window. The bakery's name, \"DEMEL,\" is prominently displayed at the top of the window, with the words \"K.U.K. Hofzuckerbacker\" and \"1786\" beneath it. Below that, the words \"WIENER KAISERSCHMARRI\" are visible. A chandelier hangs inside the bakery, and several people are visible inside, including a chef in a white hat and apron. In the foreground, the back of a woman's head is visible, and several people are sitting at tables.\n\nderstanding trends, market developments, regulatory requirements as well as expectations prevalent in society. In addition, they give valuable insight into best practices, innovative solutions and future challenges.\n\nBy involving both internal experts and external stakeholders in our decision-making processes, we ensure a holistic and balanced approach to relevant topics and issues. Their different perspectives and experiences contribute to improving the quality of our decisions, mitigating risks and taking advantage of opportunities.\n\nIn the course of the surveys the participants were able to both make quantitative estimates and give qualitative answers. The key issues identified were elaborated and documented in the course of these surveys. They were asked to take into account the Company's environmental impact as well as the resulting consequences and the financial impact associated with this risk or opportunity. In the course of the surveying process to identify key Environmental, Social and Governance issues, internal experts and external stakeholders were involved to ensure a comprehensive and balanced evaluation. The analysis included all relevant aspects which were contemplated both from a qualitative and from a quantitative perspective. Key issues are listed in the following:\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n### E.MAPPING: MATERIAL TOPICS, GRI AND SDG\n\nT15 Socially responsible sourcing\n\nSocial criteria for suppliers referring to compliance with human rights, labour standards, measures against child and forced labour as well as the respecting of the rights\n\nof indigenous peoples.\n\nS2 Workers in the value chain\n\n**SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT**\n\nT16\n\nimpact and local\n\npresence\n\nPrioritisation of opportunities for local communities and\n\ncompanies.\n\nS3\n\nCommunities\n\nT17 Food safety\n\nCompliance with the highest standards for food quality, hygiene standards and food refrigeration to ensure the\n\nintegrity of our products.\n\nS4 End-users\n\nT18 Security of guests Ensuring a high level of security at airports, on airlines,\n\nat lounges and events.

measures have already been implemented to ensure the safety of our customers and end consumers. This is particularly evident in chapters 10.1 Food safety, 10.2 Healthy diet and 10.3 Product labelling and inclusive meals. Strict adherence to the highest quality standards and rigorous controls serve to minimise or eliminate potential health risks. In addition, our products are clearly and fully labelled to promote informed decisions and avoid allergen risks. In section 11.3 Data security and protection, we ensure the secure processing and storage of sensitive data. We also work closely with airlines and event organisers to ensure that the safety of passengers and guests is guaranteed. These comprehensive measures demonstrate our commitment to the safety and well-being of all our customers and guests, while emphasising that guest safety remains a key priority for our company.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/4 description: This is a scatter plot with the x-axis labeled from 3 to 5.2 and the y-axis labeled from 3 to 4.6.

It mentions the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with the goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement. The document also highlights the importance of monitoring direct and indirect emissions, engaging with partners to assess carbon emissions, and implementing sustainable practices. Additionally, it addresses the challenges and opportunities in the food and beverage sector due to climate change, as well as the company's efforts to improve transport efficiency and reduce food waste.\n\n[ GRI 305 – 1, GRI 305 – 2, GRI 305 – 4, GRI 305 – 5 ]\n\nWe recognise the complex and important connection between food systems and the planet's health. We also recognise the risk of climate change to our business and\n\n#### **1.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nThe global scientific community, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), recognizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as the primary driver of climate change. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures, declining air quality, and other detrimental effects on Earth's ecosystems. Given our global operations, we understand the impact we have on climate change. We are committed to re-evaluating our practices and aligning with the goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C.\n\nDemonstrative of this commitment, we joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023 and are actively developing ambitious, science-based, short-term to long-term targets for GHG reduction. However, our initial assessment lacked a level of granularity that is now necessary due to increase in business activities and to the complexity of our industry and supply chains in general. We recognise that the data and collection could be inclusive, therefore we have initiated a further deep dive to ensure a more comprehensive picture. To address this, we are implementing new software and monitoring frameworks to ensure accurate data collection and alignment with relevant benchmarks.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts, we are continuously improving the efficiency of our buildings and operating equipment. This includes implementing Environmental Management Systems (\"EMS\") and Building Energy Management Systems (\"BEMS\") to establish a solid foundation for accelerating GHG reduction.\n\nBeyond energy efficiency, we prioritize compliance with waste regulations and explore cost-reduction opportunities through waste minimization strategies. We recognize this as a crucial step on our journey to reducing our emissions. In addition to operational changes, we address climate change within our food systems, a significant source of emissions. We actively work to reduce food waste and prioritize offering local and seasonal\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/20 description: A person is holding a rectangular container filled with various foods, including hummus, salad, and vegetables. The container is made of a light-colored material, possibly cardboard or a similar eco-friendly material. The salad appears to have lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a white creamy dressing. The vegetables include roasted red peppers and zucchini. The person is holding a white plastic fork in their other hand, poised to eat the food. The person is wearing a colorful patterned shirt with a coral-colored sleeve and white pants. In the background, there is a woven basket and a white book, suggesting a picnic setting.\n\nproduce. This not only reduces our carbon footprint but ensures the freshest ingredients for our culinary creations.\n\nIt has become crucial to monitor and understand both our direct and indirect emissions, particularly those stemming from our primary production source – food. These emissions, especially those falling under the Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) categories, play a significant role in our environmental impact. While individual emissions may seem insignificant, their collective effect and impact is substantial. Thus, we recognize that even the smallest ingredient or quantity can contribute to our carbon footprint. Driven by this awareness, we actively engage with partners to assess the carbon emissions of our menus. This collaboration not only aids in evaluating emissions but also facilitates menu diversification, allowing us to offer customers options with varying CO2-e footprints. Furthermore, this initiative serves to educate and inform consumers about the environmental implications of their choices, empowering them to make more sustainable decisions.\n\nThe implementation of new transportation management systems both across our event business and in airports has improved transport efficiency and routing. In our airport segment we have reduced transport time to and from the aircraft, saving waiting times, minimising delays, and reducing our emissions.\n\nIn the food and beverage sector, companies like DO & CO face distinct challenges, risks, and opportunities because of shifting climatic conditions. Climate change poses a significant test for our business, given our high reliance on external environmental factors. For instance, climate-related disruptions can jeopardize our suppliers and events may be interrupted, postponed, or cancelled due to extreme weather events. It is also important to note the growing customer and stakeholder consciousness for products and services that are climate sensitive.\n\nare creating opportunities to ensure a strong business as well as a strong planet – extending our quality without compromising our planet.\n\nThe volatility in weather patterns, leading to events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, can disrupt agricultural supply chains, impacting the availability and quality of ingredients essential for our culinary offerings. To mitigate these risks, we must ensure our products align with seasonal variations. Local sourcing has been a cornerstone of our operations since our inception, reflecting our commitment to fresh, high-quality foods. This practice ensures product freshness and reduces transportation-related emissions, contributing to a more sustainable cycle.\n\nFurthermore, by sourcing locally, we honour and celebrate the countries where we host events, reinforcing our dedication to local communities. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events present operational challenges across our global facilities. Heat stress affects employee productivity and safety, while infrastructure damage from storms or flooding disrupts production and distribution, leading to delays and increased costs. As consumer awareness of climate change grows, there is a rising demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly products and services. DO & CO must adapt its offerings, accordingly, incorporating locally sourced ingredients, minimizing food waste, and introducing plant-based options into menus.\n\nAmidst these challenges lie opportunities for innovation. Investing in sustainable practices, such as renewable energy, waste reduction, and eco-friendly packaging, can differentiate DO & CO in the market and attract environmentally conscious customers. By positioning ourselves as leaders in environmental responsibility, we want to capitalize on emerging market opportunities, expand our customer base, and strengthen our competitive advantage. All whilst contributing to the ongoing need for increarise and extreme events become more frequent, our research informs proactive measures to mitigate potential disruptions. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, we aim to significantly reduce our GHG emissions and contribute meaningfully to global climate change mitigation efforts. We recognize the ongoing challenge of data collection and continuous improvement, and we are committed to investing in necessary resources and technologies to achieve our ambitious goals.\n\nsed corporate environmental responsibility. Our efforts in implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) and adhering to the EU Taxonomy have provided quantitative insights into the effects of climate change across our operations. This enables us to anticipate future risks anddevelop strategies to address them effectively. As temperatures In conclusion, climate change presents multifaceted challenges and opportunities for DO & CO, affecting our supply chain, operations, financial performance, and brand reputation. By proactively addressing climate risks, embracing sustainable practices, and seizing market opportunities, we can navigate the complexities of a changing climate while creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.1.2.

Emissions intensity, Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) related, measured by revenue, shows a notable change from last year, the intensity factors dropped by 43% for the intensity per revenue. This is despite experiencing business growth and adding new locations. It is important to note that improved reporting methods may have contributed to this reduction.\n\nWhile we have implemented energy-efficient systems and waste management improvements, further analysis is needed to fully isolate the impact of these initiatives. We remain committed to following the GHG Protocol guidelines. We utilize a mixed consumption/spend-based methodology, consistent with prior reports.\n\nFor the current business year, Scope 3 emissions were not calculated using the previously applied method as the software used\n\n#### **1.2.ENERGY CONSUMPTION**\n\n[ GRI 302 – 1, GRI 302 – 3, GRI 302 – 4 ]\n\nEnergy consumption defined here includes both direct energy use (e.g., electricity for lighting and appliances) and indirect energy use (e.g., the energy used to manufacture and transport the goods and services we use). Our goal is to address both sides of the equation, with a focus on expanding our reliance on renewable energy. We are happy to report that we have expanded our renewable electricity reliance to approximately 75% across our operations in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Türkiye.\n\nFurther rollout of EMS allows us to gain a clearer understanding of our overall energy consumption and plan for continual improvement. By pinpointing areas of greatest energy use, we can prioritize targeted efficiency upgrades. This focus on reduction complements our strong belief in transitioning to renewable resources. However, we recognize that renewable energy alone is not the sole solution. In our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, we also address the efficiency of our buildings and operating equipment.\n\n#### **1.2.1. STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nEnergy consumption at DO & CO has significant implications across various aspects of our operations, affecting our environmental footprint, operational efficiency, financial performance, regulatory compliance, stakeholder relations, and overall reputation.\n\n### **EMPOWERING PEOPLE, PROTECTING THE PLANET,**  BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nThese efforts are further supported by the development of Building Energy Management Systems across key units with our EMS, working on monitoring and measuring activities with improvements in our building management systems (another example of Twin Transition strategy). Through the improvement of our BEMS, we are unlocking and increasing our decarbonisation efforts. By using the system to identify leakage areas of our most intense zones, we are taking actions such as the addition of cold room door curtains to maintain temperature. We have seen how simple techniques like this, to the dashboarding and live monitoring of high usage equipment, drives both business and environmental improvements. In the access areas of our units, we are monitoring our consumption and piloting various energy controls as well as putting in place simple and practical solutions such as fridge curtains and sensors on high energy usage machinery. In addition to this and as a contributor to minimizing our transportation environmental impact and future emissions, we are working to develop and improve two specific solutions. Firstly, we are improving our utilisation of local storage instead of shipping materials and goods from global events back to a central location, significantly reducing transportation distances and associated emissions. Secondly, our Transport Management Systems are optimizing routing and minimizing vehicle standstill times at our airline locations, leading to savings in fuel and potential delays.\n\nfor it is no longer available. To ensure our report's consistency, we decided to still report on our Scope 3 emissions on a simplified and estimated basis as follows. For the current business year, we report our Scope 3 emissions based on the number of meals handed out during the reporting period. In doing so, we have calculated an emissions factor based on emissions per meal for 2022/2023 and applied to the most recent number of meals.\n\nThis method resulted in an increase of emissions by 14%. This assumption is based on simple clarity and the fact that our structure and activities taken into account within Scope 3 have not changed materially. We are currently revising our calculation methodology and assume we will be able to provide a more exact overview next year.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n| INDICATOR                                                      | RESULT             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total energy consumption<br>(renewable and non-renewable)      | 952,301,901.76 MJ  |\n| Total energy consumption<br>(renewable)                        | 496,516,842.45 MJ  |\n| Total energy consumption<br>(non-renewable)                    | 455,785,059.31 MJ  |\n| Energy intensity per EUR revenues                              | 0.53 MJ/EUR        |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(renewable and non-renewable) | 260,834,704.38 kWh |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(renewable)                   | 116,917,977.10 kWh |\n| Total electricity consumption<br>(non-renewable)               | 143,916,727.28 kWh |\n| Electricity intensity per EUR revenue                          | 0.15 kWh/EUR       |\n| Number of vehicles                                             | 1,043              |\n| Number of conventional vehicles                                | 1,029              |\n| Number of e-vehicles                                           | 7                  |\n| Number of hybrid vehicles                                      | 7                  |\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/4 description: The image shows a world map made of trees and water.

The trees are dense and varied, creating a textured and natural look. The water is calm and reflective, adding to the serene and peaceful atmosphere of the image. The overall effect is one of harmony between nature and geography, highlighting the importance of trees and water in shaping our world.\n\n#### **1.2.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nDue to exponential business growth in the last year, we have seen an increase of energy consumption. However, despite this growth we have significantly increased our reliance on renewable electricity, reaching 45% usage levels, (in the previous year, we only consumed 21 % of our electricity from renewable energy sources). This is mostly due to several units switching to fully renewable contracts, including in Spain, Austria, Türkiye, and\n\nUK. Many of our other units are increasing their proportion of renewable as the availability allows. We see an active increase in electricity intensity per revenue, which can be attributed to an expansion of units. As our new units settle into regular working, energy audits become more regular. And as energy management is developed, we will see shift to a more positive energy\n\n### reduction. I.ENVIRONMENT 2.E2 POLLUTION\n\n#### **2.1.WASTE**\n\n[ GRI 306 – 1, GRI 306 – 2, GRI 306 – 3 ]\n\nAs a global catering company, we divide our waste reporting into three categories, each requiring a specific management approach throughout our production lines. We prioritize the waste hierarchy principles, with prevention always taking precedence. With the help of proprietary digital solutions, we continually monitor, measure, and improve our processes to ensure proper sorting, recycling, or disposal, of waste responsibly and sustainably.\n\n#### **2.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\n.The first category is production waste, which includes waste generated during the preparation of meals and beverages for our airline, event, and restaurant customers. This waste consists of materials such as food scraps, packaging materials, and other non-hazardous materials that result from our production operations. The second category of waste is non-hazardous waste generated from the packaging and serving of meals and beverages on our returning domestic flights. This waste is typically comprised of materials such as plastic cutlery, food packaging, paper products, and plastic bottles. The third category of waste is hazardous waste generated from international flights. This waste includes items such as food residues, packaging and other materials that may pose a risk to human health or the environment if not handled properly. We have increased our waste management planning and reporting across all our activities, with additional improvements following this year. Post-event waste reports are produced after all events and reduction/prevention topics are covered in the event debrief. Across airline catering units we are improving our waste tracking from store to delivery, using bespoke software to connect all sections of our process to identify waste, cause, and work towards prevention. Cross unit working groups have identified departments that are still reliant on paper, and these are currently being digitalised\n\nWaste prevention is our focus. Where we cannot transform waste as a new resource (make circular) we look to packaging, which is sustainable and low impact, produced/designed for minimal environmental footprint. Our sustainability experts work closely with our industrial design specialists to ensure that our customers have the most suitable options available.\n\n(instead of paper, more work is now being carried out on tablets). Not only saving paper but moving to tablet usage, the teams on the ground can access the most up to date information. Again, another step-in process improvement, operational efficiency, and sustainability. It is proof that sustainability is not a silo, but an essential function for business excellence.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of the waste management hierarchy.

The sections are labeled as follows, from top to bottom: PREVENTION, REUSE, RECYCLE, RECOVER, and DISPOSE.\n\n### WASTE HIERARCHY\n\n#### **PREVENTION**\n\nWithin our Twin Transition program, waste prevention is a key priority. A key aspect of this collaboration involves our IT team partnering with the Sustainability team to improve waste tracking throughout kitchen operations. This enhanced data provides valuable insights into areas with peak waste generation. By identifying these hotspots, we can implement preventive measures and continuously adapt our practices to minimize waste at the source. This focus on prevention is particularly important for our fresh produce. We achieve this by implementing just-intime deliveries, ensuring products are utilized at optimal quality. Additionally, there are regular meetings involving relevant stakeholders, such as kitchen staff and sustainability representatives, who review the week's waste data, pinpoint areas exceeding expectations, and collaborate to tackle the root causes. In our efforts to combat plastic waste, we have replaced plastic bottles with cold water fountains in a unit. This initiative alone\n\nis projected to save over 5,840 kilograms of plastic at a single medium-sized unit.\n\n#### **RECYCLE**\n\nWe collaborate with our airline partners to increase onboard waste recycling potential. Collection of onboard waste, sorting on board and reporting is now the industry standard. Regular checks take place to ensure that what can be is sorted appropriately. Continual improvement opportunities are evaluated and tested. We have seen in an increase in the availability of waste segregation possibility at events sites, a helpful and positive trend.\n\n#### **RECOVER**\n\nFood waste represents a sizeable portion of our overall waste stream. Because we know that it is imperative we reduce our environmental impact and critically, reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, we are exploring the option of food waste composting as a potential waste management solution. By composting our food waste, we can create a valuable resource for local agriculture while also reducing our overall waste footprint. We also use incineration to recover energy from our waste. While we recognise that this is not the ideal method of waste disposal, it is necessary for a sizeable portion of our waste due to regulatory requirements.\n\n#### **DISPOSE**\n\nAlthough this is our least preferred option, we still aim to dispose of waste in a responsible manner that minimises the environmental impact. We only dispose of waste materials that cannot be reduced, reused, or recycled, and we prioritise disposal methods that are the least harmful to the environment. As technology advances and regulations change, it will become easier to take advantage reduce our output and increase the proportion of materials that remain in the economic loop, limiting the need for the use of virgin resources, such as plastic, metal, paper, and glass.\n\n#### **RE – USE**\n\nWe have made a shift towards more rotatable products in our internal operations. As we operate in a premium segment, we are continually identifying opportunities to repurpose materials within our own operations, as well as exploring partnerships with other businesses or organisations that can make use of our waste materials.\n\nAt our events especially, we strive to minimise food waste and promote sustainability by carefully managing our food inventory and portions. In the event of surplus food, we donate these meals to local food banks, where possible. By responsibly donating any leftovers to local food banks, we support our local communities while also reducing food waste and promoting sustainability.\n\n#### **2.1.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nOur environmental management systems and controls are delivering results. We have significantly reduced total waste generation, down to 74,375 tonnes from 110,851 tonnes. This decrease applies to both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with a steeper decline (65%) in hazardous materials. Waste intensity per euro of revenue also dropped significantly 48%. Our core focus on prevention, increased separation across our locations and collaboration with our internal and external teams, are key factors.\n\n# Total waste generated 74,375.18 tonnes Total non-hazardous waste 56,318.31 tonnes Total hazardous waste 18,056.87 tonnes\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/17 description: A brown paper bag filled with food scraps sits on a light green surface.

E3 WATER\n\n### **3.1.WATER CONSUMPTION**\n\n[ GRI 303 – 3 ]\n\nFreshwater sources are a scarce and valuable global resource. Our commitment to responsible water use is a core element of our environmental strategy, reflected in\n\nour \"Use of Natural Resources\" policy. This policy contains strict regulations for the use of fresh water and includes the development of a water management strategy.\n\n#### **3.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nIn alignment with our EMS, we are working on a comprehensive water stewardship strategy focused on continuous improvement. We are implementing consistent water usage data collection across all operations, providing a clear picture of consumption patterns and areas for improvement. This data will directly inform future water management strategies that support our environmental goals.\n\nFurthermore, we are moving beyond reactive measures by proactively identifying and mitigating potential water risks like equipment failure or inefficient processes. The EMS facilitates a continual cycle of reviewing water use data, identifying improvement areas, and implementing corrective actions. This data-driven approach, informed by this framework's compliance considerations, will guide future investments in water-efficient technologies and processes. Ultimately, this strategy allows us to continuously improve water use efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance our brand image as a leader in environmental responsibility, positioning us well for the challenges and opportunities of water stewardship in the years to come.\n\n### **DO & CO AIMS TO CONTINUE TO INSPIRE OUR STAKEHOLDERS & CONTINUE ITS LONGSTANDING TRADITION OF BEING IN**\n\nthe forefront of innovation in the culinary, catering & event industry.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/17 description: A person wearing black gloves is washing a metal pot in a stainless steel sink.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nWater usage per revenue has decreased by 12%, despite an overall water withdrawal increase of 8%. While US locations achieved the best water intensity per revenue (under 0.10), further analysis through our enhanced systems is needed to understand the reasons behind the 8% withdrawal increase. This increase might be due to factors like increased business activity or expansion to new locations, requiring more water for facilities. With our planned environmental management systems rollout, we will see further improvement in recording the data and identifying areas for improvement.\n\n#### INDICATOR RESULT\n\nWater intensity by EUR revenue 1.84 litre/EUR\n\nWater withdrawal\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/11 description: A clear glass bottle and a wine glass filled with liquid are on a white table.

E4 BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn recent years, the Earth's biodiversity profile has been affected by deforestation, peatland conversion and ocean pollution. Due to this, natural processes such as pollination, seed dispersal and nutrient cycling are endangered. We recognise that healthy ecosystems are integral to a secure food system. As such we understand that we have the responsibility to safeguard our supply chain and products from practices that potentially disrupt ecosystem functioning and threaten a species' existence. To this aim, we are working with our customers to decrease the use of ingredients that are related to deforestation- and work towards the protection of both forests and peatland conversion. As we work to improve and verify our supply chain, and that of our customers, we prioritise sustainability certifications that ensure respect for biodiversity and animal welfare.\n\n#### **4.1.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nLocal sourcing is key to freshness and quality, we aim to source as much as possible in a radius of 500km from the event or established unit.\n\nThis year we have seen an increase of local sourcing across the board from 51% to 59%. Türkiye and Spain both boasting over 80% of local produce. With an increase in requests for environmentally conscious events and services, and with the availability fantastic artisanal local projects growing we expect this number to continue to increase.\n\nAs part of our sustainability efforts, we conducted a comprehensive risk mapping exercise for the main ingredients that we\n\n#### **4.1.ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOURCING**\n\nAt DO & CO one of our top priorities is to ensure that our sourcing practices are sustainable, both environmentally and socially. From an environmental perspective, we strive to minimise our carbon footprint by sourcing locally whenever possible, reducing unnecessary packaging and waste, and choosing suppliers who prioritise sustainable farming and fishing practices. From a social perspective, we believe in fair labour practices and supporting our local communities. This means working with our suppliers who prioritise fair wages, safe conditions, and ethical sourcing. We believe that by making conscious choices about our sourcing practices, we can create a positive impact on both the connected environment and the committees.\n\n#### **4.1.1. STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nIn the European Union, the United Kingdom and Türkiye operations, we define locally sourced as coming from producers under 500km radius of the unit or event. Our partnerships with local food producers complement our efforts to support economic development in all the communities in which we do business. At the same time, we are working with stakeholders across our value chain to actively promote better, more sustainable approaches to food production, consumption, and distribution, including discussions with customers, suppliers, and regulators. As our business practices integrate improved food resource efficiency, we open the door to enhanced positive environmental and social impact of our operations, as well as to productivity, cost management, and operational performance.\n\nHowever, we recognize there are potential downsides associated with sustainable local sourcing. Limited availability of local ingredients can impact menu options and potentially increase costs. Seasonal variations may require adjustments to menus, source. Our aim was to identify and prioritise the environmental and social risks associated with each ingredient, including human rights risks that are cross-cutting and apply to all our ingredients.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, we identified seven key risks that require immediate attention: emissions contribution,\n\ndeforestation and peatland conversion, marine conservation, GMO, antibiotics use, animal welfare and human rights. These risks were mapped against the ingredients in our supply chain, including beef, chicken and eggs, fish and seafood, soy, cacao, coffee, palm oil, and paper.\n\n| INDICATOR                      | RESULT |\n|--------------------------------|--------|\n| Locally sourced<br>ingredients | 59 %   |\n\nand ensuring consistent quality from local producers requires a strong focus on quality control. Scalability can also be a challenge as our business expands.\n\nThe truth remains that the opportunities presented by sustainable sourcing are significant. By promoting our commitment to responsible practices, we attract environmentally and socially conscious customers. Collaboration with local producers fosters innovation in menu development and sourcing strategies. Reduced transportation costs and potentially lower local prices can lead to significant savings. Furthermore, focusing on local and sustainable practices can mitigate risks associated with climate change and potential supply chain disruptions. Additionally, it helps to promote local businesses and stimulate the local economy.\n\nAs stated in our sustainable sourcing policy we seek to standardise our sourcing practices and ensure that human rights and environmental laws are engrained into our practices. To support these practices through a Supplier Code of Conduct in which we outline our expectations for suppliers regarding ethical and sustainable practices. The below metrics are aligned are policies and will be built on over the coming years, as we improve our supplier audits and tracking.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/19 description: The image shows the text \"59% LOCALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS\".

E5 CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nOur primary focus is on waste prevention, but in instances where prevention is not feasible, we are committed to transitioning into a circular company with an emphasis on sustainable waste management practices. Recognizing the significant resources utilized in our operations, particularly in terms of food products, it is important for us to conscientiously manage our waste output and take proactive measures to minimize it.\n\nWe echo the call by our aviation partners and IATA for the European Commission to reassess its approach, enabling the aviation sector to play a more proactive role in the circular economy by facilitating cabin waste prevention and reuse and recycling initiatives.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/14 description: The image shows three crushed blue plastic bottles against a white background with small tan flecks. One bottle is in the lower right corner, another is in the lower left, and the third is in the upper right.\n\nOur Sustainability and Quality Teams collaborate closely with industry partners and customers to address these challenges and explore innovative solutions that align with our and our customers sustainability goals. Waste prevention is our focus and where we cannot reinsert our waste as a new resource, in the case of international flights, we look to packaging which is sustainable and low impact produce/ designed for minimal environmental footprint. Our sustainability experts work closely with our industrial design specialists to ensure that our customers have the most suitable options available.\n\n### **5.1.FOOD AND PACKAGING WASTE**\n\n[ GRI 306 – 2 ]\n\nFood waste (the inedible parts removed from the human food supply chain) and packaging waste pose significant environmental and social challenges, impacting the Entire Resource Depletion Spectrum (ERDS). Food waste not only represents a loss of valuable resources used in its production (water, land, energy) but also contributes to GHG emissions. While often vital for food safety and preservation, packaging waste can strain resource availability and lead to pollution if not managed responsibly.\n\nAt DO & CO we are committed to minimizing food and packaging waste throughout our operations. Through these efforts, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint by minimizing resource depletion, GHG emissions, and potential pollution associated with food waste and inefficient packaging. Additionally, we promote social responsibility by contributing to a more sustainable food system that minimizes food insecurity and the environmental burdens placed on future generations. Ultimately, by optimizing resource utilization throughout the supply chain, we contribute to a more circular economy.\n\n#### **5.1.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nFood waste presents a significant environmental and social challenge. Discarded food represents a substantial loss of precious resources – water, land, and energy – used in its production. Furthermore, decomposition of wasted food generates greenhouse gases, accelerating climate change. The social impact is equally concerning. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation reports that 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food go to waste annually, equivalent to 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2. This wasted food could alleviate hunger and food insecurity.\n\nThe UN's Food and Agricultural Organization reports that, each year, the world wastes 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food, and this food waste generates an estimated 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses. In other words, food that could be preventing starvation is instead causing threats to the health of our planet and its inhabitants.\n\nWe recognize the importance of addressing food waste within our operations. Despite our efforts to carefully manage food inventory and portions at events, excess leftovers occasionally arise.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/12 description: The image shows a circular diagram with three sections, each containing text related to sustainability and recycling. The first section, colored in a muted green, contains the words \"CONSCIOUSLY CREATING\". Adjacent to this, there's a smaller section with the text \"FROM WASTE TO VALUE\" and a logo that appears to be \"DO&CO\". The second section, also in muted green, reads \"RECOVERY RECYCLE\". The third section, in a lighter shade of green, says \"REUSE REDISTRIBUTE\". The diagram is designed to represent a continuous cycle, suggesting a closed-loop system for waste management and resource utilization.\n\n### **FOOD WASTE**\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: This image shows two pages from the DO & CO sustainability report 2023/24.

The right page has the following text: AIRLINES In our airline catering division waste management remains a complex topic. The current International Catering Waste (ICW) rules, driven by animal health concerns, present a challenge to the aviation catering sector's ability to contribute positively to the circular economy through cabin waste prevention, reuse, and recycling initiatives. While waste generated on flights operating within certain territorial borders or the EU can be efficiently processed, reused, and recycled, the same is not true for waste from international flights originating outside of those borders. (\"Towards Smarter Regulation of International Catering Waste - IATA Joint Statement 2022\") Passengers are increasingly concerned about the impact of cabin waste, notably single-use plastics (SUPs), while governments are focusing on minimizing food waste. In alignment with the sentiments expressed in the IATA report, we are actively engaged with our customers in advocating for a review of international catering waste regulations. EVENTS We are working with our event customers to donate any surplus to local charities, ensuring that nutritious food reaches those in need while mitigating waste. However, we acknowledge that food waste remains a significant component of our overall waste stream. In response, we are actively exploring the implementation of food waste composting as a viable waste management solution. By composting our food waste, we not only reduce landfill contributions but also generate a valuable resource for local agriculture. Most importantly, as part of a Twin Transition plan, we are enhancing our waste tracking processes through digitalization and predictive tooling, aiming to minimize food waste throughout our operations. CONCLUSION Despite these risks, significant opportunities exist to address food waste. By minimizing food waste throughout our operations, we can significantly reduce our environmental footprint. This translates to lower resource depletion, decreased GHG emissions, and minimized pollution associated with disposal of wasted food. Furthermore, by optimizing resource utilization throughout the supply chain, we contribute to a more sustainable food system. Reducing food waste also comes with economic benefits. Less wasted food translates to lower purchasing and disposal costs. Finally, minimizing waste can enhance operational efficiency.

Food donations at events are becoming a regular request and requirement. We are proud to work with our partners to find the best solutions for left over produce which is suitable for donating. This year we see a rise in our contributions, especially in Germany and in Türkiye. This is a mixture of both food inventory, but also food leftovers in which we work together with local charities. The largest donations coming from our Turkish unit, who work with location communities to distribute the excess.\n\n#### **5.2. SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING**\n\nSingle-use plastics (SUPs) have become ubiquitous in our modern world, yet their convenience comes at a significant environmental cost. These non-biodegradable materials contribute heavily to plastic pollution in our oceans, to wildlife endangerment, and to microplastic contamination. Furthermore, the production of SUP's consumes valuable resources and often relies on fossil fuels.\n\nDO & CO recognizes the detrimental impact of SUPs and is committed to transitioning towards a sustainable future. This commitment is particularly relevant in our UK operations, where we adhere to the recently implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging – these regulations make producers of the product responsible for the waste disposal of packaging that they produce.\n\nEliminating SUPs entirely can be challenging, especially when considering health and safety regulations within the food service industry. However, this is challenge that we are ready to face here at DO & CO. We are actively working with our partners and our internal industrial design and quality teams to develop innovative and sustainable solutions. This collaborative approach allows us to explore alternatives that meet the highest standards for food safety and hygiene while minimizing our environmental footprint.\n\n| INDICATOR      | RESULT                                                  |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Food donations | 1,139.50 Tonnes<br>(equivalent to<br>2.8 million meals) |\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/3 description: A close-up shot shows a stack of sandwiches.

The overall composition of the image is appealing and appetizing.\n\nOur dedication to environmental responsibility extends beyond SUPs and encompasses all our packaging solutions. Our Industrial Design, Quality, and Procurement teams look for an implement solution that align with the EU Circular Economy Strategy (COM/2018/028). This strategy emphasizes the use of recycled materials and the design of products for reuse, recycling, or composting.\n\n### 5.2.2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\ndesign departments to eliminate SUPs items where appropriate. This includes items such as bags, lids, straws, packaging, and cutlery, with a goal to eliminate them from our operations by 2030. While certain food safety requirements currently prevent the complete elimination of SUPs, we are committed to continually searching for new potential solutions and innovations for the remaining challenging items. We look forward to further developing our measuring and monitoring capabilities in this area. By setting benchmarks with our customers and continuously improving our strategies, we aim to drive impactful change and lead the industry toward a more sustainable future.\n\nWe recognize the significant environmental impact of packaging and are committed to minimizing it. By optimizing designs and utilizing recycled materials, we can significantly reduce our overall packaging footprint. This success hinges on collaborating with our customers to present these innovative and practical solutions. Given our reach of over 170 million people per year, DO & CO is uniquely positioned to raise awareness and present a united sustainable front, setting benchmarks for our industry.\n\nAdditionally, addressing plastic pollution is a top priority. We are partnering with suppliers, customers, and our internal industrial\n\n#### **5.2.1.STRATEGY AND IMPACTS**\n\nMaintaining food safety standards is paramount for our products. Therefore, all new packaging undergoes rigorous testing before receiving approval. During the design phase, we consider the full life cycle of the packaging, prioritizing options made from reusable, compostable, or recycled materials wherever feasible. In cases where thermal treatment is necessary, we opt for low-impact sustainable materials to minimize the environmental effect. While packaging plays a vital role in food safety and preservation, improper management can create environmental challenges. Misused packaging can strain resource availability if not recycled responsibly and contribute to pollution if not disposed of properly.

EU-TAXONOMY\n\n#### **6.1.INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe EU Taxonomy plays a key role in the initiatives of the European Union (EU) for sustainable finances. The EU Taxonomy is a key classification system defining clear criteria to identify economic activities making a reasonable contribution to the transition to a zero-carbon and environmentally sustainable future as set out in the European Green Deal. By directing investments to the targets of the Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy is expected to direct capital to projects and activities that make a substantial contribution to reaching the EU's climate and energy targets for 2030 and to reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nIn line with Regulations (EU) 2020/852 dated 18 June 2020, (EU) 2021/2139 dated 4 June 2021, (EU) 2021/2178 dated 6 July 2021 and (EU) 2022/1214 dated 9 Marc 2022 and the corresponding changes by the delegated acts on environment and climate (EU) 2023/2485 and 2023/2486 dated 27 June 2023, the Company is obligated to transparently disclose three key performance indicators: turnover, CapEx (capital expenditures) and OpEx (operational expenditures). The basic step to determine compliance with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy is to assess climate-relevant aspects of our business activity. The EU Taxonomy calls for reporting on our contribution to selected environmental objectives:\n\n(1) Climate change mitigation (CCM) (2) Climate change adaptation (CCA) (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (WTR) (4) Transition to a circular economy (CE)\n\n(5) Pollution prevention and control (PPC)\n\n(6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)\n\nReaching taxonomy eligibility under the EU Taxonomy Regulation shows that the economic activity of the company is in scope of the EU Taxonomy. Turnover, CapEx (capital expenditures) and OpEx (operational expenditures) related to this activity are considered taxonomy-eligible. The qualification \"taxonomy-aligned\" is stricter. Taxonomy alignment requires that the activity is not only considered taxonomy-eligible but also significantly contributes to at least one of the Taxonomy's six environmental objectives. The contribution must be made without doing significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, meeting relevant technical screening critieria. Furthermore, the climate risk and vulnerability is to be assessed and the company must ensure minimum social safeguards. Turnover, CAPEX and OPEX related to such an activity are considered taxonomy-aligned.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/8 description: A high-angle, close-up shot showcases a bowl of vibrant green soup, elegantly garnished. The soup, smooth and creamy, fills the center of a large, white, shallow bowl. Atop the soup, a dollop of white cream is drizzled with olive oil, adding a contrasting element to the green canvas. Sprigs of fresh greens and small pieces of shrimp are scattered around the cream, enhancing the visual appeal and suggesting the soup's ingredients. The bowl is placed on a white surface, with soft shadows adding depth and dimension to the composition.\n\n#### **6.2.PROCEDURE**\n\nAn extensive impact analysis was carried out for all environmental objectives and activities regarding all three KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). In this analysis only CapEx-relevant activities were identified and allocated to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\". This applies in addition to the activity generating turnover of BIO 2.1 comprising hotels, holiday parks, camping sites and similar accommodations.\n\nIn the following, we refer to the business year from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The first essential step of the EU Taxonomy assessment process was identifying DO & CO's taxonomy-eligible economic activities. Assessing taxonomy eligibility started with a thorough analysis in order to identify all significant economic activities of DO & CO. In order to ensure compliance with the EU Taxonomy, it was crucial to identify all relevant economic activities and to classify them pursuant to the determined criteria. since DO & CO Aktiengesellschaft does not carry out any activities determined \"eligible\" under this objective and there are no adjustment plans for identified climate risks regarding CapEx and OpEx. Furthermore, no relevant activities for CapEx, OpEx or turnover were identified for the environmental objectives 3-6, in addition to the above mentioned hotel business generating turnover. Our activities do not contribute to multiple environmental objectives.\n\nThe environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\" does not comprise any taxonomy-eligible activities at the moment, Our finance data are aggregated on group level, but data collection and data assessment is carried out individually at every location. This means, that the raw data is recorded pursuant to the local GAAP of the respective location. During final consolidation and finalisation, group values are taken into account in order to ensure single presentation and comparability. Thus, this approach enables detailed analysis on a local level, while ensuring consistent group reporting.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe financial accounts were classified according to the KPIs. Furthermore, the accounts were categorised as taxonomy-eligible or not taxonomy-eligible pursuant to the EU Taxonomy.\n\nAccounts categorised as taxonomy-eligible have been allocated to the previously identified economic activities. In order to avoid double counting, all KPIs were allocated to the respective economic activities and assessed whether they can be classified as taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned. In cases where the classification taxonomy-eligible relates to several activities, the economic activity is allocated to the environmental objective \"Climate change mitigation\". Turnover, CapEx and OpEx were calculated pursuant to the definition of disclosure included in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\nAfter identifying relevant economic activities of the company, we assessed whether the activities are taxonomy-aligned pursuant to the EU Taxonomy. We assessed whether the relevant economic activities met the criteria for classification as taxonomyaligned. A taxonomy-aligned activity must comply with all three criteria:\n\n- Substantial Contribution: the economic activity substantially contributes to meeting at least one of the six environmental objectives stated in the EU Taxonomy.\n- Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): it is ensured that the economic activity does not significantly harm one of the other five environmental objectives.\n\n| ECONOMIC ACTIVITY                                                                        | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                  | KPI ALLOCATION |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Activity 6.5: Transport by<br>motorbikes, passenger cars<br>nd light commercial vehicles | Financing and leasing activities as well as maintenance activities<br>regarding our passenger and light commercial vehicles. | CapEx          |\n| Activity 6.6 Freight transport<br>services by road                                       | Financing and leasing activities as well as maintenance activities<br>regarding heavy commercial vehicles.                   | CapEx          |\n\n### SECTION 7: CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES\n\n• Minimum Social Safeguards: the company complies with the minimum social safeguards as defined in the Taxonomy framework.\n\nThis process started with an extensive review of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the corresponding documents in order to fully understand the subtleties of each criterion. In the following, a systematic approach was applied to collect relevant data on the economic activities to be assessed. These data comprise a wide range of factors, including but not limited to environmental key performance indicators, energy efficiency key performance indicators and compliance with established sustainability standards.\n\nThe DNSH principle states that economic activities classified as environmentally sustainable may not significantly harm any other environmental objective stated in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Therefore, each economic activity defined by the Taxonomy is to be thoroughly assessed in order to ensure compliance with DNSH.\n\nWe have started an extensive assessment of the criteria for classification as taxonomy-aligned. This includes assessing technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria including climate risk and vulnerability analysis as well as minimum social safeguards. We do not comply with the relevant technical screening criteria for classification as taxonomy-aligned for any of the stated activities and KPIs. Therefore, we do not report any taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the business year 2023/24.\n\nActivity 7.3: Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n\ndoors;\n\n-

The denominator of the turnover key performance indicator is composed of consolidated net turnover on group level including income from the sale of products and services as well as intangible assets, excluding rebates, discounts and similar deductions. The numerator of the ratio includes turnover from merchandise and services as well as intangible assets related to taxonomy-eligible economic activities. By applying activity 2.1 to turnover and the resulting new reporting, this this key performance indicator was assessed more in detail during calculation, while the underlying collection process remained unchanged. Pursuant to Article 5 (6) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 in connection with the Disclosures Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, the group has opted for the phase-in option for the business year 2023/24. This means that taxonomy-eligible turnover is not checked for classification as taxonomy-aligned which is why no taxonomy-aligned turnover is reported.\n\n|     | TURNOVER SHARE / TOTAL TURNOVER |                                 |\n|-----|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned per objective  | Taxonomy-eligible per objective |\n| CCM | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| CCA | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| WTR | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| CE  | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| PPC | 0,00%                           | 0,00%                           |\n| BIO | 0,00%                           | 0,43%                           |\n\nDO & CO sustainability report 2023/24 ··· 51\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n# I.ENVIRONMENT\n\n### 6.

The table is divided into two main sections: \"ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PURSUANT TO THE DELEGATED REGULATION\" and \"CAPEX SHARE/TOTAL CAPEX.\" The first section lists economic activities and their corresponding total numerator in MEUR (millions of euros). The activities include: EA 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (5.35 MEUR), EA 6.6. Freight transport services by road (8.35 MEUR), EA 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment (0.82 MEUR), and EA 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings (74.68 MEUR). The second section, \"CAPEX SHARE/TOTAL CAPEX,\" shows the taxonomy-aligned and taxonomy-eligible percentages for various categories: CCM (0.00% aligned, 53.46% eligible), CCA (0.00% aligned, 0.00% eligible), WTR (0.00% aligned, 0.00% eligible), CE (0.00% aligned, 0.00% eligible), PPC (0.00% aligned, 0.00% eligible), and BIO (0.00% aligned, 0.10% eligible).\n\nCapEx of the business year 2023/2024 has mainly changed through the increase in additions to assets in the course of construction. This increase results from the expansion of the business lines due to acquiring new customers especially in the Airline Catering division and the International Event Catering division in the US.\n\nWe have improved the collection process through more precise inquiries and more detailed data collecting by deepening the\n\n## I.ENVIRONMENT 6.

EU-TAXONOMY\n\n#### **6.5.OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES OPEX**\n\nThe denominator includes direct not capitalised costs relating to research and development, renovation measures for buildings, short-term rental agreements, maintenance and repair as well as all other direct expenses relating to ongoing maintenance of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThese expenditures can be made by the organisation itself or outsourced to third parties in order to ensure continuous and efficient operation of assets, in this case cleaning costs. The numerator represents the share of operational expenditures in the denominator which relates to assets or processes in connection with taxonomy-orientated economic activities and direct not capitalised costs for research and development. Pursuant to the EU Taxonomy, operational expenditures not significant for the company's business model are not to be considered. The denominator of the operational expenditures was calculated pursuant to the above description and amounts to in total mEUR 46,39 . The numerator was not broken down in detail by economic sectors due to materiality reasons, since pursuant to the EU Taxonomy OpEx is not significant for DO & CO's business model. We consider the OpEx denominator as not significant compared to the previous year for the first time, due to a more detailed calculation method and a different approach.\n\nThe insignificance was assessed in qualitative terms as well as in terms of quantity. In qualitative terms, our operational expenditures are not a significant part of our business model.

Workplace discrimination or unfair treatment based on race, gender, or other factors is a concern in any organization. Our approach is to prioritize a culture of respect and inclusivity at DO & CO, involving continuous evaluation and improvement of our labour practices to create a supportive and equitable workplace environment.\n\nA key element of our internal development approach is crossfunctional job rotation.

This allows a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.\n\n#### **7.1.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nOur headcount has increased 11% since last year (previous year: 13,496). This is due to the expansion of business activities in some units, including growth in Turkey, the opening of our new unit in Miami and the expansion of the unit in New York.\n\nWe recognise the importance of addressing the high employee turnover rate exhibited above. This rate can be partially attributed to the seasonal nature of the airline and events industry where we also hire seasonal support, giving employees flexible work opportunities.\n\nAt DO & CO we guarantee a sense of job security for our staff by ensuring that our seasonal employees are welcomed back to their roles year after year, or if desired, to merge into the main company operations.\n\n| INDICATOR                              | RESULT          |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Employee Headcount                     | 15,048          |\n| Employee FTE                           | 13, 327         |\n| Total Hours Worked<br>(incl. overtime) | 33,436,058.87   |\n| Employee turnover                      | 40%             |\n| thereof female                         | 37%             |\n| thereof male                           | 63%             |\n| Number of<br>work stoppages / strikes  | 0               |\n| Average compensatio<br>per FTE, in     | EUR 32, 565     |\n| Total remuneration of<br>all employees | EUR 468,180,124 |\n\n#### **7.2.OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\n[ GRI 403 – 1, GRI 403 – 2, GRI 403 – 4, GRI 403 – 5 ]\n\nAt DO & CO, prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees is a foundational principle, spanning operations ranging from small-scale private events to large-scale endeavours.

In the context of the food and catering industry, compliance with local, state, and federal regulations pertaining to food safety, workplace safety, and occupational health is foundational. This encompasses rigorous food handling practices, stringent cleanliness standards, and the implementation of robust safety protocols. By establishing explicit safety procedures for tasks such as heavy lifting, equipment operation, and thermal hazard injuries. We acknowledge the common risks and challenges of our industry such as demanding work schedules, including long shifts, overtime, or irregular hours, can lead to employee fatigue, reduced alertness, and increased risk of accidents. Similarly, understaffing may result in increased workload and stress, compromising employees' ability to work safely and efficiently. We respond to these challenges with a proactive approach with renewed commitment to foster a safe and supportive work environment that empowers our team to deliver exceptional service to our customers.

These are automatic assumptions we might not even realize we are making, and they can impact recruitment and promotion decisions. This can lead to underrepresentation of certain groups in leadership roles, which can hinder inclusivity. We work to address this challenge head-on and encourage diversity. To make fair decisions, we equip our managers with training on unconscious bias and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) topics.\n\nOur goal is a workplace where everyone feels valued and can thrive. Diversity isn't just something we tolerate; it is a fundamental driver of success and innovation. When everyone feels included and can contribute, we all achieve more together.\n\n#### **7.3.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nThis year 37% of our workforce is composed of women, which is an increase of 4 per cent points on previous year.

Most notably our Turkish, Polish, and part of our Austrian operations are female-led. In terms of gender representation in leadership roles, the kitchen chef positions have the lowest representation of women.

Through internal training programs, employees receive specialized instruction in culinary techniques, food safety practices, and customer service skills, enhancing their competency and ability to deliver high-quality service. Many of our employees have benefited from job rotations and in-house development opportunities, progressing significantly within the company, and exemplifying our commitment to developing career growth.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/9 description: Two chefs are preparing food outdoors.

The background shows trees and a blue sky.\n\n#### **7.4.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nWe are currently unable to provide precise data on training hours. Our aim is to avoid publishing inaccurate figures, so we will focus on obtaining accurate data in the near future. It is important to note that accurately recording training hours, especially on-the-job training, is a challenge. We are actively working on implementing a learning management system that will enable the recording and formalization of training. However, this figure will not be published for this reporting year due to the quality of the data.\n\nA key element of this approach is cross-functional job rotation. This allows employees to gain valuable experience in different areas of the business, expanding their skillsets and preparing them for future growth opportunities.\n\nWe cultivate a positive workplace culture by embracing a less hierarchical structure. We believe in open communication, collaboration, and empowering our team members to take ownership of their roles. This creates a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.\n\nDespite the positive impacts of our training initiatives, challenges such as inconsistency in delivery and inadequate resource allocation for training programs may nonetheless influence task effectiveness. However, we proactively address these challenges by providing regular updates and reminders to ensure compliance with the latest health and safety guidelines. By leveraging opportunities for progression, flexible development access through a combination of in-person and online learning, and a focus on cross-functional experiences, we aim to overcome challenges and maximize the positive impacts of our training initiatives on employee growth and career advancement.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/16 description: A group of people are standing in a room, holding papers and smiling.

Ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and opportunities for professional growth across the value chain not only upholds human rights but also fosters trust and collaboration among stakeholders. Furthermore, prioritizing the well-being of workers in the value chain aligns with sustainability goals by promoting social responsibility and resilience within the industry.

We address key areas like human rights deforestation, animal welfare, and biodiversity and through our supplier code of conduct expect all our suppliers to adhere.\n\nWe prioritize sustainable sourcing, especially for high-impact products like beef and palm oil. Our goal is to eliminate deforestation and peatland conversion by 2030. Additionally, our sustainable sourcing policy emphasizes high animal welfare standards. For example, we are phasing out caged eggs and chickens across all our kitchens globally.\n\nCollaboration with our customers strengthens our efforts. We provide education and support to those who prioritize distinct aspects of their supply chain, such as offering menus with specific sustainability certifications or helping them track the origin of their food. Together, we ensure responsible and ethical sourcing, maintaining the high quality whether it is on an airline or at a sporting event.\n\nIn line with pending legislation, we are rolling out supply chain audits, starting in Germany under the LKSG (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtsgesetz) regulation (effective January 2023). This initiative will expand under the EU's recently passed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), although it may take several years to come into full force. However, we are committed to going beyond mere compliance. We believe the food supply chain is so crucial and delicate that we are prioritizing supply chain audits for the coming year. We hold our suppliers accountable for adhering to our code of conduct through a variety of measures, including audits and contractual agreements. We are committed to transparency and publish annual sustainability reports that detail our progress and goals.\n\nEnsuring sustainable and socially responsible sourcing practices is a key priority within our operations at DO & CO. We are committed to supporting fair labour practices and local communities by partnering with suppliers who prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and ethical sourcing. This deliberate approach not only contributes to positive environmental impacts by reducing transportation-related emissions through local sourcing but also fosters economic development within the communities we operate in.\n\nNavigating complex supply chains with multiple intermediaries and global networks underscores the importance of maintaining transparency and upholding ethical sourcing practices. This complexity emphasizes the need for robust systems and processes that ensure integrity throughout our sourcing operations. By implementing such measures, we empower ourselves to make informed decisions that align with our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nIn addition to addressing these supply chain challenges, we are dedicated to minimizing inefficiencies such as overproduction and food waste, which contribute to resource depletion and GHG emissions, exacerbating global food insecurity. Furthermore, our focus on sourcing from reputable suppliers with stringent quality standards reduces food safety risks, ensuring consumer health and safety. We prioritize consumer education on socially responsible sourcing practices and maintain transparency in our supply chain by tracing ingredient origins, taking accountability, and building trust with our consumers. Through these efforts, we not only uphold ethical standards but also make positive contributions to the environment and the communities we serve in the food and catering industry.\n\n#### **8.1.2.PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nLocal sourcing is key to freshness and quality, we aim to source as much as possible in a radius of 500km from the event or established unit.
