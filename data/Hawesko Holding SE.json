While sales to the restaurant and hotel sectors were increased, sales to food retailers and specialist retailers were below the previous year's level and fell short of expectations. The B2B segment, like the Retail and e-commerce units, had to adjust to occasionally steep product price increases by producers, but in view of its role as an intermediary it\n\nThe statement of income for the B2B segment in the first half of 2023 still showed the effect of the initial consolidation of *Global Wines & Spirits*, following on from its initial full consolidation at 1 July 2022.

Disregarding this\n\nhas less scope than the two B2B segments to switch out the products or move to private labels.\n\neffect, like-for-like sales revenues and operating EBIT would have been down on the previous year.\n\nOverall, the B2B segment achieved an operating result of € 9.8 million and therefore a rate of return of 4.7 percent. To restore the minimum required rate of return to above 5 percent, structural cost-cutting measures were already taken in the financial year, especially in the administrative areas. These measures necessitated expenses amounting to € 0.7 million, for which the operating result was adjusted accordingly.\n\n**CONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR B2B SEGMENT** € '000 **2023**\n\n**RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECI-ATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING** \n\n**RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING** \n\n**SALES REVENUES 207.182 200.598** Internal sales between segments 7.683 7.318 Cost of materials -148.667 -145.905\n\n**44**\n\n| € '000                                                                        | 2023     | As % of sales | 2022     | As % of sales | Change  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|---------|\n| SALES REVENUES                                                                | 220.331  |               | 242.397  |               |         |\n| Internal sales between segments                                               | 1.185    |               | 1.244    |               |         |\n| Cost of materials                                                             | -111.907 |               | -123.443 |               |         |\n| GROSS PROFIT                                                                  | 109.609  | 49,7 %        | 120.198  | 49,6 %        | 0,2 %P  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                            | -31.920  | -14,5 %       | -31.592  | -13,0 %       | -1,5 %P |\n| Advertising expense                                                           | -26.838  | -12,2 %       | -30.877  | -12,7 %       | 0,6 %P  |\n| Freight and logistics costs                                                   | -21.170  | -9,6 %        | -23.500  | -9,7 %        | 0,1 %P  |\n| Other costs                                                                   | -16.452  | -7,5 %        | -15.513  | -6,4 %        | -1,1 %P |\n| Other income                                                                  | 2.696    | 1,2 %         | 1.980    | 0,8 %         | 0,4 %P  |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECI<br>ATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING<br>EBITDA) | 15.925   | 7,2 %         | 20.696   | 8,5 %         | -1,3 %P |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                                 | -4.877   | -2,2 %        | -4.959   | -2,0 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING<br>EBIT)                                        | 11.049   | 5,0 %         | 15.737   | 6,5 %         | -1,5 %P |\n\nThe units of the e-commerce segment broadly faced a challenging financial year 2023, in which the hoped-for turnaround in sales revenues did not yet come. Sales fell by 9.1 percent to € 220.3 million. This level is still well above the pre-COVID level (2019: € 178.6 million) but fell for the second successive year. Within the segment, particularly the fine wine units *Tesdorpf* and *WeinArt* experienced a more marked downturn. By contrast, *WirWinzer* and *Vinos* by and large maintained sales at a steady level.\n\nWhile gross profit was increased slightly despite producer-end price increases, personnel costs went up by a disproportionately high 1.5 percentage points due to inflationary adjustment payments awarded in lower salary groups and in logistics. Conversely advertising expenses were lower: such activities were scaled back to reflect the market situation.\n\nThe lower sales led to a € 4.6 million fall in the operating result, with the rate of return down 1.5 percentage points. Continuing high logistics costs and rising IT costs coupled with higher personnel expenses mean profitability has deteriorated, necessitating adjustments to processes and costs in 2024.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrently none of the topics addressed in this section represents a material risk to the business activity of the group.

He collects and monitors CSR-related data, and reports on this to the full Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\n#### *Applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation*\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation represents a regulatory classification system for green economic activity and is divided into the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1.) Climate change mitigation\n- 2.) Climate change adaptation\n\n**46**\n\n- 3.) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4.) Transition to a circular economy\n- 5.) Waste avoidance and recycling\n- 6.) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the EU Taxonomy, economic activities are \"environmentally sustainable\" if they:\n\n- make a material contribution to attainment of one or more of the six environmental objectives\n- do not significantly harm attainment of the five other EU environmental objectives\n- meet the minimum protection requirements for occupational safety and human rights.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe classification of economic activities according to how far they make a material contribution and avoid harming other environmental goals is to be based on technical screening criteria. Economic activities are taxonomy-eligible if they can be matched with the description of an activity from the corresponding annexes of the delegated legal acts of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the individual environmental objectives, and taxonomy-conforming if they meet the technical screening criteria for that activity.\n\nIn November 2022 the criteria for the four last environmental objectives as well as for new activities of the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation were published in the Official Journal of the European Union. For the 2023 financial year it is now mandatory to report on all six environmental objectives. However there remain relief possibilities for the newly published environmental objectives and activities; it is therefore merely necessary to report on the taxonomy eligibility of those activities in this financial year.\n\nWe initially matched the economic activities of the Hawesko Group to the relevant taxonomy activities, and identified exclusively those activities that come under the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation in equal measure. These environmental objectives include e.g. the energy operations and selected manufacturing, transport and building sectors. Trading activities, and therefore the core business of the Hawesko Group, are still not yet covered by the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the year under review, including under the new environmental goals and activities. Activities in the value chain that do not generate sales but result in assets are equally included in the taxonomy and are reported as capital expenditures (CapEx). In light of this, only the acquisition and leasing of buildings such as office buildings and retail spaces are identified as a material taxonomy-eligible economic activity within the Hawesko Group (economic activity 7.7 in the annexes to the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation).\n\nThe three reportable key performance indicators (KPIs) comprise the sales KPI, the CapEx KPI and the OpEx KPI. The provisions of the EU Taxonomy refer to the net sales revenues (€ 660 million – see section 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial for its calculation). Because the taxonomy does not currently cover any sales-generating activities of the *Hawesko Group*, no taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-conforming sales revenues or related capital expenditures (CapEx) or operational expenditures (OpEx) can be reported. For the activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" we made taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) in connection with the additions to property, plant and equipment in the amount of € 24.2 million. These taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) comprise previous capital expenditure on the expansion of the ecommerce logistics centre as well as capitalised lease agreements for retail spaces for *Jacques'*, *Wein & Co*. and *Vinos*, and office buildings. The total capital expenditure of the *Hawesko Group* comprises all additions from capital expenditure or additions from rights of use in accordance with the definition of the denominator for capital expenditure, and came to € 31.3 in the year under review. The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) therefore represent just under 80 percent of total capital expenditure. Beyond that, we did not identify any further material capital expenditures (CapEx). To avoid double counting and in light of the very specific requirements of objective 2.) climate change adaptation, we allocate our taxonomy-eligible CapEx to objective 1.) climate change mitigation. The operational expenditures (OpEx) according to the EU Taxonomy comprise direct, non-capitalised costs in connection with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair as well as other direct expenditure on the day-to-day\n\n**48**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nmaintenance of items of property, plant and equipment, and amount to approx. € 1.0 million (previous year: approx. € 1.3 million).

To obtain this information, the *Hawesko Group* as lessee is dependent on documentation from third parties (lessors) because the assessment in the EU Taxonomy refers exclusively to the acquisition of buildings. We are in discussion with our contractual partners to obtain evidence that can be used to determine taxonomy conformity.

To avoid double counting and in light of the very specific requirements of objective 2.) climate change adaptation, we allocate our taxonomy-eligible CapEx to objective 1.) climate change mitigation. The operational expenditures (OpEx) according to the EU Taxonomy comprise direct, non-capitalised costs in connection with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair as well as other direct expenditure on the day-to-day\n\nonomy-conforming if they meet the technical screening criteria for that activity.\n\nties in this financial year.\n\nclimate change adaptation).\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* expects that further sectors that could be relevant for the core business of the *Hawesko Group* might be included in the taxonomy over the course of the next few years. The scope of reporting would therefore change accordingly. Until then, a fresh examination of taxonomy eligibility and conformity to reflect business expansion and capital expenditures will be conducted annually.\n\nTables pursuant to Annex II of the Delegated Legal Act on Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation:\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nDNSH criteria (\"do no significant harm\")\n\n**Circular economy**\n\n**Pollution**\n\n(1) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21)\n\n**Biodiversity and ecosystem**\n\nJ/N J/N J/N J/N J/N J/N E T\n\n**Minimum protection**\n\n**Taxonomyconforming sales share, 2023**\n\n**Taxonomyconforming sales share, 2022**\n\n**Category (enabling activities)**\n\n**Category (transitional activities)**\n\n**Water and marine resourc es**\n\n**Economic activities**\n\nA.

As a trader, our responsibility\n\nThe objective of the *Hawesko Group* is to consistently reduce carbon emissions per bottle sold, thereby helping to protect the climate. For the product wine, the weight of the bottle is a carbon emissions driver that impacts the entire value chain. The lighter the glass bottle is, the lower the carbon emissions are in the manufacture, shipping and disposal of the bottle. The *Hawesko Group* has identified potential in optimising the weight of the bottle, and particularly for its private labels will look at the weight of the bottle as a priority issue when developing products in the future. In addition, pushing the establishment of the bag-in-box as an environmentally more beneficial form of packaging for wine is a strategy with which especially *Jacques'* is\n\nFor the shipment of goods from producers in Europe to our warehouses, we fundamentally engage only carriers that use vehicles equipped with state-of-the-art emission control and after-treatment technology. Where possible, rail or sea are used for sections of the itinerary. Shipments fundamentally use resource-friendly Euro pallets to DIN EN 13698, which can be used multiple times. Very energy-intensive air freight is virtually never\n\nBy using the \"GoGreen\" shipping option of DHL, the *Hawesko Group* has been offsetting elements of its environmental footprint since 2020.

Sustainable products already account for 70 percent of sales.\n\nCompared to other branches of agriculture, wine-growing is fundamentally characterised to some degree by a long-term view. The vines in a vineyard do not start to bear fruit until their third year and produce their most reliable yields after around 20 years. Still older vines are generally considered a rarity and the harvest is high in quality. By definition, winemakers therefore strive to conduct wine-growing sustainably.\n\nThe characteristics and attributes of high-quality wines in terms of taste and quality depend greatly on the local cultivation conditions as well as the methods of viticulture and vinification adopted by each producer. These may vary considerably between wine-growing region and producer. Consequently, various constantly evolving methods are used to operate in a sustainable and environment-friendly manner. But while national and regional regulations may vary, there is a growing trend worldwide towards conscious, sustainable viticulture, vinification and appropriate further processing.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* constantly draws on its influence to balance the demands, expectations and positions of the various parties involved. In the purchasing sphere, the Hawesko Group unceasingly encourages its suppliers to adopt eco-friendly practices and support the use of organic methods of cultivation and vinification. Many producers are receptive to this input and have their processes adapted and certified accordingly.\n\n#### *Certified shop-based retailing*\n\n*Jacques'* designs its shop-based business to be sustainable. By 2023 *Jacques'* had already obtained the \"FAIR'N GREEN\" seal of sustainability for around two-thirds of the more than 330 outlets run by independent agency partners. Around a further 100 outlets will receive certification in the coming year 2024 and a rolling process of sustainable development will be established.\n\n#### *Carbon footprint*\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* does not have production facilities and belongs in the commerce sector of the economy. To that extent the group has only indirect influence over how effectively the relevant environmental standards are complied with in the growing and production of the products it trades in. The impact of our business activity on the environment is therefore not comparable to that of businesses in manufacturing industry.\n\n",

Behind them is a shelf with wine bottles on it.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Shareholders, Dear Friends of the *Hawesko Group,*\n\nWe were able to impress our customers with our notable wine expertise and strong performance as a premium wine trader in the past financial year of 2023, despite the still-challenging market conditions. The *Hawesko Group* maintained sales at a very high level, underscoring our ambition to play a defining role in the European wine trade thanks to our critical mass.\n\nThe uncertainty in the global economy and above all high domestic inflation had already undermined economic development and consumer spending in Germany in the previous year. Sadly there were no signs of a much-needed trend reversal throughout the entire course of 2023. The German Wine Institute thus reported a year-on-year downturn in per capita wine consumption. Ultimately thanks to our ample portfolio of diverse business models across different segments, we are pleased to report that the *Hawesko Group* performed better than the market. While sales in the e-commerce segment declined slightly, the Retail and B2B areas both enjoyed sales growth, which consequently enabled the *Hawesko Group* to outstrip the performance of the market as a whole. A key factor is that we attach huge importance to fulfilling the wishes of our customers by listening to them and keeping our finger on the pulse of the world of wine. As a result we continue to be perceived as a highly attractive place to shop, with an exceptional range and outstanding service. That ultimately lets the customer wholeheartedly enjoy the extensive range of wines supplied by the *Hawesko Group,* whether at home, with friends or when dining out.\n\nOur strong positioning is founded on the twin pillars of innovation and continuing development, irrespective of whether these processes are driven by our own initiatives or in close cooperation with the winemakers. We develop trends – or pick up on them – and collaborate with the winemakers in implementing them for new or established private\n\nlabel wines and exclusive products. We also identify what our customers prefer and want, and put our heart and soul into meeting those wishes. We then find contemporary, inspiring ways to present these concepts in our wide range of shops. Specifically our in-store tastings with expert advice, for instance at *Jacques'* with its explicit invitation to \"Come in and taste\" or our appearances at various events, prove effective at engaging our customers.\n\nOur counterpart approach in e-commerce with the very extensive range – *HAWESKO* carries over 6,000 wines, for example – highlights our remarkable expertise in wine. Artificial intelligence enables us to provide personalised advice for our customers and propose suitable products. Both approaches to how we support the decision-making process, whether in-store or online, create high loyalty and help people identify with the *Hawesko Group*. Every day we are motivated by the ambition to create special moments to savour.\n\nAmid all this, we *Hawesko Group* and our winemakers have had to adjust to further cost increases in almost every area of sourcing products and services. Even if this development had broadly been expected and could be built into our plans, it demanded a huge effort on the part of management to resist the pressure of costs and develop and implement ways of cushioning or compensating for it. We have exercised strict cost discipline, but also sought to increase internal productivity or ensure that price rises do not inhibit customer purchases and have therefore gone some way towards offsetting these effects. Huge commitment and a willingness to question the status quo and implement change have made possible these vital steps towards creating leaner processes in the future. Our systematic price adjustments, which have included restructuring the range, can be considered a success given that our customers display high price sensitivity.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2024, we are not expecting any fundamental turnaround in the market conditions; we do not expect consumers of wine to show an increased inclination to buy, nor will the cost situation ease. At the same time, we nevertheless anticipate growth in sales and earnings. We are in a position to adjust readily to the prevailing economic situation and to let the passage of time work in our favour. To that end, we have drawn up and implemented measures for practically every area, from purchasing to sales. As well as paying particular care to how we select and present products, we are adopting leaner processes, making use of AI, increasing automation and steadily refining how we present the offering along every channel.\n\nWe also aim to build on our existing concepts and expand our market position. That encompasses everything from opening additional Retail outlets to stepping up our successful e-commerce activities. The launch of the *WirWinzer* concept as part of our expansion into further European countries now gives local winemakers the chance to offer their products in the countries in which we are already established. This has added a fresh dimension to our wide range of options for e-commerce. And 2024 will bring another highlight: campaigns at *Jacques'* and *HAWESKO* to mark their 50th and 60th anniversaries respectively are bound to delight our customers and lend extra momentum to our business development.\n\nAmid all this, it is clear to us that our group of companies can only succeed if it operates in tandem with its various partners in a way that brings added value – starting with our customers and the winemakers. Above all, we acknowledge our employees as our most precious asset. With their immense passion, deep commitment, unique expertise and sheer professionalism, they are able to serve the wider interests of people, the natural world and the environment in our sphere of influence and activity, and do so with responsibility. Ultimately that is the only way we will meet our own expectations and\n\nachieve the standards of sustainability and longterm orientation that serve as our benchmark. Going forward, we therefore want to remain an approachable group of companies that is relatable for our customers and partners, nurtures a culture of personal contact and offers excellent wine expertise. We will continue to actively shape the premium wine trade in Europe and be a leading player. Further potential corporate acquisitions will also bolster our market position. In 2023, we for example acquired a 50 percent stake in the Eastern European *Dunker Group* in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Major capital expenditure on the expansion and modernisation of our e-commerce logistics will also give us an edge, going forward.\n\nEven in these exceptional times we want you, our shareholders, to participate suitably in our corporate success. At the same time we are focusing on creating the best possible basis for our company to operate just as effectively in the market. We and the Supervisory Board therefore propose a dividend of €1.30 per share. This reduction in the dividend compared with the previous year reflects the economic situation and gives us future scope to remain a self-sufficient market operator that is ahead of the curve.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/5 description: A close-up shot shows a vine with several green leaves against a white background. The vine is thin and brown, with small tendrils curling off to the left. The leaves are various sizes and shades of green, with some showing hints of yellow. The leaves have jagged edges and prominent veins. The composition is simple and clean, with the focus on the natural details of the vine and leaves.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to thank you, our employees, and also our agency partners for demonstrating their commitment to *Jacques'* and their clientele on a daily basis in all their personal interactions. Thank you to all the winemakers who have continued to entrust their exclusive products to us, and to all partners who have provided us with their valued services. Last but not least, we should thank our many loyal customers.\n\nWe look forward to shaping the future development of the *Hawesko Group* with you at our side, and to extending our leading market position.\n\nThe Board of Management\n\nThorsten Hermelink, Alexander Borwitzky, Hendrik Schneider\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/0 description: This image is a framed picture of a variety of fruits and nuts, along with a glass of white wine.

We bring together enterprising premium formats, each of which has its own clear profile and an established market position.\n\nWe bring together a network of independent companies as a group under the three segments e-commerce, Retail and B2B, enabling us to offer a single portfolio that covers all sales channels. We consequently always have a presence precisely where our customers are minded to look for the right wines to enjoy at life's special moments – with a local, customer-focused emphasis. That is something all the companies of the *Hawesko Group* achieve to an admirable degree; in doing so they play a crucial role in making us Germany's premium and luxury-segment market leader with around a 25 percent share of the market – and Europe's No. 1 premium wine trader.\n\nPutting the customer at the heart of all our decisions and actions – that is the fundamental principle of the *Hawesko Group.* Whether operating out of a garage in Hamburg in 1964 or from a rough-andready shop in Düsseldorf in 1974, we have always remained true to this idea. It still remains the very\n\nTYPICAL AROMAS pineapple • grapefruit • vanilla • hazelnut • roast aromas • gooseberry caramel • apple • papaya • lemon • star fruit\n\nChardonnay\n\nbasis of our success today. With our deep roots in the world of wines, we offer exceptional expertise at every level. The closeness and sense of partnership with the winemakers that has been built up over many years puts us at a unique advantage. As indeed do our teams of wine experts, who spot trends sooner than others and come up with the perfect response. Last but not least, our group benefits from decades of experience and data-based knowledge of what our customers want.\n\nAll these factors help us achieve our overriding goal: to carve out a competitive advantage by offering exclusive products and targeting customers in a differentiated manner. Our reward? Commercial success and a high level of satisfaction among our clientele.\n\nWith this business model, we have become Europe's No. 1 trader of premium wine and continue to build on this position with our relish for innovation.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n# E-COMMERCE\n\nThe trend towards a convenient shopping experience from home continues,\n\n#### including in the wine sector: around 40 percent\\* of all premium-end wines are already bought online.\n\nWe are excellently positioned online with our e-commerce companies, and as Germany's biggest online retailer with sales of €220 million we have very good coverage of the relevant markets and customer segments. It helps that we know the individual requirements and demands of our customers, in conjunction with our taste algorithm, our powerful, scalable digital commerce platform and our carefully targeted marketing campaigns. The use of AI technologies enables us to handle processes more efficiently and with better outcomes for the customer. So however impersonal e-commerce may seem, we are actually very close to our clientele, who we can impress with an extraordinarily diverse product range of over 50,000 different wines, an excellent knowledge of wine and a delightful succession of new wines that taste sensationally good.\n\nOur six companies in this segment operate under a variety of formats and are the embodiment of choice and quality in the world of wine. Each of our formats has its own unique strategy and emphasis, and each one is a dependable supplier of premium wines in its specific market. In combination, they represent a strong unit that is able to serve a broad spectrum of around one million customers. Whether connoisseurs, bons vivants or novices, people who appreciate wine will find precisely the right products here. This diversification ensures everyone can make the most of their own personal wine experience.\n\nThanks to our companies' passion and expertise, wine lovers can easily discover their favourite wines and order them conveniently online. *HAWESKO* was among the first in the wine market to create an app to make the mobile shopping experience even more\n\nefficient. We offer our customers exclusive products and attractive deals and events for an enhanced shopping experience. Just a few months ago, *HAWESKO* specifically expanded its range with a marketplace concept. To date, 1,000 carefully selected wines have been added to the range. The goal for 2024 is to put another 5,000 top products on the marketplace. In the future, people looking for wine online will increasingly find we – and in some cases only we – have what they want. That will increase our visibility in search engines and secure our market lead. As well as online and through in-app purchasing of wine, our customers are enthusiastically taking up the option to consult our wine experts by phone for advice. High logistical requirements and steady growth in orders and shipments prompted us to invest in a new logistics centre. We are now able to deliver over 3,000,000 consignments punctually and damage-free to the designated recipient.\n\nWe are proud of our reputation as a leading e-commerce vendor and of our consistently superb quality and excellent service. They inspire people to trust our formats when shopping for wine – because they know they will not only receive top-class products, but also be served by experts who share their passion for premium wines.\n\n> TYPICAL AROMAS blackcurrant • woodiness • coffee beans • eucalyptus • blackberry black cherry • mint • graphite • dark chocolate\n\nCabernet Sauvignon\n\n#### **COMPANIES IN THE SEGMENT**\n\n**HAWESKO TESDORPF THE WINE COMPANY WEINART WEIN & VINOS WIRWINZER** \n\n*\\*Hawesko Group estimate*\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image shows a variety of items arranged on a white background, framed by a decorative border.

They serve up a unique shopping experience that appeals to all the senses. Our employees and retail partners are renowned for their remarkable wine expertise. At the 338 outlets run by independent agency partners in Germany and the 23 independently managed shops in Austria, they are on hand to provide individual advice, propose a tasting and help people choose their perfect favourite wines from our carefully curated range. *Jacques'* is also pioneering new standards in specialist wine retailing and has been putting the outlets forward for the sustainability mark FAIR'N GREEN since 2022.\n\nOur local omnichannel retailing includes a professional web presence for information and orders, as well as events that enable our customers to delve deeper into the fascinating world of wine, complete with the back story of the winemakers. As well as stimulating the sense of taste, regular events, tastings and wine samplings offer an intriguing insight into how the wines are made and the stories behind them. We held over 4,300 events in 2023; the inviting atmosphere gave our customers a first-hand opportunity to be inspired by the winemakers' passion and expertise. Through our events, we aim to delight people and give them an entirely new perspective on the product wine – because there is much more to it than taste alone! This concept enables us not only to offer a shopping experience, but also to create lasting memories and establish an emotional bond.\n\nPinot Gris TYPICAL AROMAS ripe honeydew melon • salad burnet • vanilla • almond • hazelnut • apple • pear • citrus fruits We run wine bars at five of our *Wein & Co.* shops. Guests there can choose from Austria's biggest walk-in wine list, simply pick the wine of their choice from the shelves and enjoy it at the bar for a small corkage fee. Accompanied by snacks, this wine experience is a tremendous way to spend the evening in good company. Once a year *Wein & Co.* customers can attend the \"MondoVino\" in Vienna, one of the biggest in-house events for wine producers.\n\nWe also cultivate ties with our customers using targeted customer loyalty measures based on our customer cards \"Mein Jacques'\" and \"Vinocard\". Card holders receive attractive benefits from their very first purchase. The scheme gives us detailed knowledge of our customers and creates a strong sense of loyalty among them thanks to our deep understanding of their requirements. With more than one million customer cards issued, we know what they are looking for and can therefore adjust our range and communications accordingly. This precise understanding of our clientele also enables us to assess very accurately where to open new shops. Based on comprehensive analyses and data, we can then identify potential locations that will appeal to prospective customers and reflect their shopping patterns. Our continuing expansion is therefore based on sound knowledge.\n\n#### **COMPANIES IN THE SEGMENT**\n\n**JACQUES' WEIN & CO.**\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# B2B\n\nAs a leading wholesaler of wines, champagnes and spirits nationally and internationally, we enjoy the profound trust of our winemakers.

With sales of € 660.3 million and an average of 1,283 employees in the 2023 financial year, it is among the largest wine traders in the premium and luxury segment in Europe. The group comprises *Hawesko Holding SE* and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* categorises its activities under three operating units (segments).\n\nThe *e-commerce segment* concentrates on online retailing to consumers and comprises both its own trading business and marketplace concepts. The strategic emphasis is on operating its own trading business and also on operating a marketplace on which for example winemakers can sell their wines directly to consumers. The e-commerce segment's formats are each distinct in terms of theme and the ranges offered. *HAWESKO*, Germany's largest premium online wine trader, belongs in this segment, as does the online Spanish wine specialist *Vinos*. *WirWinzer* is the leading marketplace model for winemakers. At the ultra-premium end of the segment are *Tesdorpf*, one of the oldest and biggest fine wine traders in Germany, and *WeinArt*, which represents the absolute pinnacle of the wine sector as a trader of exceptionally rare wines.\n\nThe *Retail segment* comprises multi-channel trading concepts primarily in the form of consumer-facing wineshop retailers. *Jacques'*, the largest chain of specialist wine retailers in Germany, and the premium format *Wein & Co.* in Austria provide a unique shopping experience for those who love wine. In total, 361 physical shops in Germany and Austria enable customers to discover the world of wine in authentic style. At the 338 *Jacques'* wine shops (previous year: 332), the focus is on personal advice, tastings and a carefully curated product range. Customers of the 23 *Wein & Co.* shops and bars (previous year: 22) in Austria's main population centres will experience top-notch wines from all over the world, as well as moments to savour.\n\n**24**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nAbayan\n\nGlobalwine\n\nWein Wolf\n\nBalmerk (joint venture)\n\nGlobal Wines & Spirits\n\nGrand Cru Select\n\nWein Wolf Austria\n\nThe *B2B segment* brackets together various distribution companies in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Czech Republic, as well as a joint venture in the Baltics that was established this year.

It is an expression of true zest for life and our entire passion. That passion is something we seek to share with our customers every day.\n\nWith sales of € 660.3 million, the *Hawesko Group* is already among the largest wine traders in the premium segment in Europe. In a reflection of the fragmented, local market structures that dictate the value-adding relationships with customers and winemakers, the group has a predominantly non-central form of organisation but does not neglect potential for synergy and economies of scale in back-office areas.\n\nSince 2015 the group's strategic goal has remained unchanged: \"to be Europe's largest, most innovative and most profitable wine trading group at the premium end of the market\". The overarching entrepreneurial principle within the group is always to achieve profitable growth. Overall, the group strategy comprises five elements:\n\n#### *Markets, growth*\n\nIn the 2023 financial year the *Hawesko Group* achieved the bulk of its sales – 82 percent – in Germany and 18 percent in other European countries, mainly Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and the Czech Republic.\n\nOur goal is to continue building on an already very good European market position for the group. We will do so through acquisitions and the targeted expansion of formats that are already established. The overriding goal within this is to use our high marketing expertise to gain targeted access to new customer groups through a range of retail business models, thus realising further economies of scale in both internal processes and external supplier relationships.\n\nIn Germany, the *Hawesko Group* already has a premium market share of more than 20 percent overall and in every segment. Our strategic goal is to grow faster than the market every year. In a contracting market environment that is seeing lower per capita consumption and declining customer reach (DIW, Nielsen), we again increased our market share slightly in 2023. Future growth will be generated substantially through continuing organic expansion in the segments. For example, further expansion of *Jacques'* retail space to up to 500 outlets is planned over the coming years.\n\nIn 2023 the *Hawesko Group* entered into a strategic partnership with the *Dunker Group*, in which connection it acquired 50 percent of the shares of *Dunker Group OÜ*. This extends the international activities of the *Hawesko Group* and signals its entry into the Baltic market. *Dunker Group OÜ* (\"*Dunker*\") and its subsidiaries, with sales approaching € 77 million, is one of the leading wine distributors in the Baltic States and has around 160 employees. *Dunker* has previously been led by the partnership of shareholders Andres Villomann and Arvo Kask (each 50 percent). The latter sold his shares to the *Hawesko Group* and is stepping back from executive management.\n\n**26**\n\n*Digitalisation*\n\nin order to capitalise on the group's scale.\n\nporating our social and governance goals.\n\n*People, talents, leadership*\n\n*Operational excellence*\n\n*Sustainability*\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nOur goal is to transform the *Hawesko Group* into a digitally proficient organisation with best-in-class e-commerce business by drawing on its very thorough understanding of customers as a growth driver. We also use digitalisation to enhance our internal efficiency long-term. Digitalisation offers huge synergy potential in the group, in the form of pooled capital expenditure and the sharing of best practices by the individual group companies. We plan to use AI to support all these areas.

To give that DNA a firm anchor, in 2021 we approved a comprehensive sustainability strategy that establishes a shared system of values across all long-established activities and practices at our companies as well as incorporating our social and governance goals.\n\n#### *People, talents, leadership*\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* sees itself as an employer with cultural values based on trust and clear, respectful leadership principles. We want to have an enthusiastic, enquiring, engaged and diverse workforce. Our goal is to train up managers ourselves at every level. In recent years we have thus been able to fill 67 percent of senior positions in the group internally. A centrally coordinated HR function for People & Culture handles management development and recruitment across all companies and consciously encourages secondments between the companies by promoting transparency and the intragroup deployment of colleagues.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, PRINCIPLES AND FINANCIAL TARGETS**\n\nWe follow a group-wide management system for the setting and attainment of our strategic goals. We apply specific performance indicators in order to obtain a dependable and transparent measure of our success. The internal management systems of *Hawesko Holding SE* and its subsidiaries support the Board of Management and executive management with managing and overseeing the group, the segments and the individual subsidiaries. The systems comprise planning, actual and forecast calculations and are based on the group's annually updated multi-year plan. They take account of market developments, trends, investments and their effect on the *Hawesko Group* as well as the group's financial leeway.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe purpose of corporate management is to develop the *Hawesko Group* and its subsidiaries continuously and sustainably.\n\nGroup reporting comprises monthly profit and loss accounting as well as quarterly reports prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that cover all consolidated subsidiaries, and presents the net worth, financial position and financial performance of the group and its operating units. Financial reporting is supplemented by further detailed information that is needed to assess and manage business operations.\n\nAnother component of the management systems involves reports prepared annually on the material risks that the company faces, supplemented as necessary with ad hoc announcements.\n\nThe above reports are discussed at Board of Management and Supervisory Board meetings and serve as key documents for the group's assessments and decisions.\n\nThe combined management report and the financial statements of the *Hawesko Group* are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. In addition to the required disclosures and key figures, the *Hawesko Group* publishes alternative performance measures (APM) that are not subject to the above regulations and for which there is no generally accepted reporting standard. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the alternative performance measures with the aim of facilitating a comparison of its performance over time or with industry benchmarks. It does so by making certain adjustments to the balance sheet or statement of income items prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These adjustments may be attributable to differing accounting policies, heterogeneous business activities and non-recurring effects that impact the validity of these items. The performance measures thus obtained apply across all periods and are used both internally for business management purposes and externally to enable analysts and investors to assess the company's performance. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the following performance measures:\n\n- *Sales growth (nominal)*: the *Hawesko Group* targets consistently higher growth in sales revenues than for the market as a whole. Even if the overall market is not expanding, the group aims to increase sales revenues. The goal is to steadily increase the market share of the *Hawesko Group*.\n- *Operating EBIT and operating EBIT margin*: the company's profitability is gauged from operating EBIT (operating result before interest and taxes) and the operating EBIT margin, in other words operating EBIT relative to sales. The adjustments strip out non-recurring, non-operating aspects from the key figure EBIT and therefore permit a clearer picture of the company's operating performance. Aspects that justify an adjustment are specifically listed. They include gains or losses on disposals, extraordinary write-ups/write-downs and, as corrections, personnel-related restructuring costs and nonoperating, extraordinary costs from legal proceedings and corporate transactions. The switch to an adjusted EBIT figure announced in the previous year's report was made to facilitate comparisons with the reporting of other businesses in the industry and to increase transparency on non-sustainable profitability elements. The calculation of this key figure involves increasing EBIT by exceptional expenses and reducing it by exceptional income. The target for the operating EBIT margin is a minimum return of 5 percent. With sales revenues currently at > € 650 million, that represents a minimum\n\n**28**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nlevel of € 34 million.

The *Hawesko Group* has set itself the objective of achieving a ROCE of at least 14.0 percent.\n- *Free cash flow*: a liquidity surplus (free cash flow) should be generated from business operations so that adequate financial resources are available above all for capital expenditure and for paying appropriate dividends.\n\nThe overriding goal of economic management within the *Hawesko Group* is to generate profitable growth in both sales revenues and operating EBIT or the operating EBIT margin. Free cash flow and the operating return on investment are measured exclusively at group level in view of the overarching nature of financing and investment structures.\n\nNo key non-financial performance indicators are used in the management of the group.\n\n*Hawesko Holding SE* also uses other key figures from the balance sheet (asset items and financial debt) as well as selected key performance indicators (KPIs) for the individual segments.\n\n#### **RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT**\n\n**28**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nThe purpose of corporate management is to develop the *Hawesko Group* and its subsidiaries continuously\n\nGroup reporting comprises monthly profit and loss accounting as well as quarterly reports prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that cover all consolidated subsidiaries, and presents the net worth, financial position and financial performance of the group and its operating units. Financial reporting is supplemented by further detailed information that is needed to assess and manage\n\nAnother component of the management systems involves reports prepared annually on the material risks\n\nThe above reports are discussed at Board of Management and Supervisory Board meetings and serve as key\n\nThe combined management report and the financial statements of the *Hawesko Group* are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. In addition to the required disclosures and key figures, the *Hawesko Group* publishes alternative performance measures (APM) that are not subject to the above regulations and for which there is no generally accepted reporting standard. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the alternative performance measures with the aim of facilitating a comparison of its performance over time or with industry benchmarks. It does so by making certain adjustments to the balance sheet or statement of income items prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These adjustments may be attributable to differing accounting policies, heterogeneous business activities and non-recurring effects that impact the validity of these items. The performance measures thus obtained apply across all periods and are used both internally for business management purposes and externally to enable analysts and investors to assess the company's performance. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the following performance measures:\n\n• *Sales growth (nominal)*: the *Hawesko Group* targets consistently higher growth in sales revenues than for the market as a whole. Even if the overall market is not expanding, the group aims to increase sales revenues. The goal is to steadily increase the market share of the *Hawesko Group*.\n\n• *Operating EBIT and operating EBIT margin*: the company's profitability is gauged from operating\n\nEBIT (operating result before interest and taxes) and the operating EBIT margin, in other words operating EBIT relative to sales. The adjustments strip out non-recurring, non-operating aspects from the key figure EBIT and therefore permit a clearer picture of the company's operating performance. Aspects that justify an adjustment are specifically listed. They include gains or losses on disposals, extraordinary write-ups/write-downs and, as corrections, personnel-related restructuring costs and nonoperating, extraordinary costs from legal proceedings and corporate transactions. The switch to an adjusted EBIT figure announced in the previous year's report was made to facilitate comparisons with the reporting of other businesses in the industry and to increase transparency on non-sustainable profitability elements. The calculation of this key figure involves increasing EBIT by exceptional expenses and reducing it by exceptional income. The target for the operating EBIT margin is a minimum return of 5 percent. With sales revenues currently at > € 650 million, that represents a minimum\n\nthat the company faces, supplemented as necessary with ad hoc announcements.\n\ndocuments for the group's assessments and decisions.\n\nand sustainably.\n\nbusiness operations.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* develops central software components of its sales platforms itself, in cooperation with its strategic service providers. The development aspect refers to a software development process that involves adding new functionalities and/or improving the existing system environment with key system functionalities along the entire value and process chain. This ensures that the technology infrastructure of the *Hawesko Group* supports the corporate strategy and is harmonised with the operational processes and systems.\n\nDevelopment activities and overarching initiatives in e-commerce, especially involving testing possible applications for generative artificial intelligence, are handled by two units of the e-commerce segment on behalf of the entire group.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn its forecast for 2023, the Board of Management initially anticipated a subdued first quarter followed by inflation returning to normal levels and an improvement in consumer confidence. It expected this development to turn the tide for sales by the e-commerce units and generate slight growth in all other segments.\n\nWhile the Retail segment managed growth of just under two percent thanks mainly to *Jacques'*, sales revenues in e-commerce declined again by nine percent. The B2B segment benefited from the continuing effects in the first half of the newly consolidated *Global Wines & Spirits s.r.o.* and therefore grew by three percent. If that effect is disregarded, its sales revenues were down by just under one percent. Consolidated sales overall came to € 660 million, 1.7 percent below the prior-year figure and therefore within the corridor of the most\n\nOperating EBIT of € 34 million declined by nine percent compared with the previous year due to the lower sales; it finished within the forecast range updated in the third quarter (€ 32 – 35 million). The original forecast in Annual Report 2022 was € 37 – 42 million and was not achieved mainly due to the absence of a turnaround in e-commerce. Reported EBIT is € 24 million, significantly below the prior-year level of € 39 million. This is substantially attributable to the amortisation of goodwill for *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million along with restructuring expenses totalling € 1.6 million. The figure for the previous year moreover included\n\nConsidering the market situation the Board of Management considers the overall sales performance to be satisfactory to good, except in e-commerce. All segments were affected by the lower inclination to spend due to falling disposable incomes, but by and large compensated for this effect by developing their positioning and product ranges.

This brought to a halt the general economic recovery that had followed the slump triggered by COVID-19. Compared to the years before COVID-19, gross domestic product in 2023 was still 0.7 percent above the figure for 2019. The experts at the Federal Statistical Office put this development down to continuing high prices at all stages of the economic process, low domestic and export demand as well as unfavourable financing conditions.\n\nInflation in 2023 was less acute than in the previous year, rising by 5.9 percent (+6.9 percent in 2022), but was high for a second successive year. Food in particular was again affected especially by inflation rates and cost on average 12.4 percent more. Core inflation (the inflation rate excluding the particularly volatile categories food and energy) reached 5.1 percent in 2023 and therefore exceeded the level of 2022 (+3.8 percent). This key measure highlights how the inflation rate also remained high in all other categories of goods and extended across all sectors.\n\nThe consumer confidence index for Germany remained at the very low level of -27.6 in December. This indicates that consumer confidence was not quite as low as at the end of 2022, when the index was impacted especially by the leap in energy costs. There were no signs of a turnaround in 2023, with the figure in fact deteriorating again at the start of 2024. The GfK researchers attribute the poor consumer confidence to the unsettlingly high cost of living and other ongoing crises.\n\n#### *German wine market*\n\nThe German Wine Institute provides detailed information on the German wine market in its statistics on the past wine year (1 August 2022 – 31 July 2023). The figures show that for the period ending 31 July 2023 the German population again bought significantly less wine per capita, or 19.2 litres, compared with 19.9 litres in the prior-year period. Consumption of sparkling wine remained constant, however, at 3.2 litres. The customer reach of households in Germany who buy wine declined again and is now 10 percent below the level of 2019. The wine market in Germany thus finds itself in a situation where high supply collides with a continuing decline in demand. The development of falling demand at a time when supply is on the rise is affecting the entire European wine market, which is why the EU is supporting winemakers by providing grants for the processing of surplus wine into industrial alcohol.\n\n#### **OVERALL STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT ON 2023 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE**\n\nThe years 2020 and 2021, with the official restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a temporary marked shift in consumer behaviour as well as a special boom for the e-commerce and Retail segments. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a sharp rise in inflation; this had, and is still having, a negative impact on consumer behaviour and on all margin and cost positions.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn its forecast for 2023, the Board of Management initially anticipated a subdued first quarter followed by inflation returning to normal levels and an improvement in consumer confidence.

The user metrics for the online shops were nevertheless at a satisfactory level. The conversion rate and average shopping baskets were lower than in the previous year. Across all segments, unit sales fell more sharply than the general sales performance; price increases and a high-price product range compensated for this to some extent.\n\n| GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| in T€                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Germany                               | 543.552 | 560.111 |\n| Austria                               | 53.354  | 52.399  |\n| Czech Republic                        | 27.225  | 15.056  |\n| Switzerland                           | 19.782  | 21.425  |\n| Sweden                                | 8.680   | 11.184  |\n| Others                                | 7.687   | 11.307  |\n|                                       | 660.280 | 671.482 |\n\n#### **GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES**\n\nIn 2023 the proportion of sales revenues achieved by the group in Germany declined to 82 percent (previous year: 83 percent).

Advertising expenses in 2023 declined from € 49.3 million to € 45.4 million as a result of budget cutbacks that reflected productivity gains. The new customer figures for 2023 were correspondingly slightly down on the previous year, as expected.\n\nThe commissions to partners comprise the expenses for the sales agents in the B2B segment and also commissions to the operators of *Jacques'* stores, and rose by 1.8 percent to € 46.6 million in the financial year. The higher sales revenues in the Retail segment were the main factor here. Conversely there were slightly lower commissions as a result of falling sales revenues for the B2B segment in Germany.\n\nThere was a slight drop in freight and logistics costs for the group from € 41.0 million to € 39.9 million as a result of the weaker volume-related sales performance in e-commerce. The cost ratio equally came down slightly to 6.0 percent (previous year: 6.1 percent). While the freight costs component of the cost ratio also declined thanks to a temporary fall in the price of diesel, logistics costs in absolute terms and in the quotient were higher. The main reason is that overproportional pay increases at service providers were passed on.\n\nOther costs climbed by € 1.5 million to € 43.0 million in the financial year. This is largely due to the steppingup of events and travel in the B2B segment, as well as to tastings at *Jacques'*.\n\nConsolidated operating EBIT in the 2023 financial year came to € 34.0 million, representing a fall of € 3.4 million.

Major German food retailers in particular are generally granted much longer payment deadlines, resulting in the high receivables total. Customers in the restaurant and hotel trades are normally granted much shorter payment deadlines or must pay up front. In the B2B segment, credit default insurance is moreover taken out for most customers in the restaurant and hotel sectors to reduce the risk of non-payment. In the B2C segments Retail and e-commerce, because of the high proportion of credit card or debit card payments and the fairly small proportion of purchases on account, there is a lower level of receivables outstanding relative to sales. The *Hawesko Group* employs loan asset sales only in rare cases.\n\nIntangible assets fell by € -10.2 million to € 55.5 million. The change is principally due to goodwill impairment for *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million. Also, for the first time after several years of high capital expenditure on the digital infrastructure depreciation was applied to the new investments; this equally resulted in a planned decrease.\n\nThe property, plant and equipment and rights of use rose by € 17.2 million in the financial year. The increase comes mainly from sums invested in the expansion of the e-commerce logistics centre in Tornesch. The rights of use from capitalised lease agreements remained flat and came to € 121.0 million at 31 December 2023. For the most part the rights of use apply to rented retail space at *Jacques'* and *Wein & Co.*, as well as to office buildings.\n\nOther assets mainly include participating interests not fully consolidated, loans extended and other financial and non-financial assets. In the financial year under review this item contains investments accounted for using the equity method amounting to € 7.4 million, arising from the acquisition of *Dunker Group OÜ* and its subsequent measurement at the end of the year. This, along with higher tax receivables, produced a rise of around € 10.3 million.\n\nThe higher inventories produced a slight year-on-year increase in trade payables of € 2.7 million.\n\nThe contract liabilities are mainly in respect of points balances promised to consumers under bonus/loyalty programmes, subscription payments collected for wines not yet delivered and refunds promised to customers in the B2B segment, and fell slightly in line with advance payments.\n\nLease liabilities are in respect of future payments recognised as a liability from the tenancy and lease agreements concluded, and remained virtually constant compared with the previous year.\n\nThe decline in other liabilities is mainly attributable to lower provisions for income tax payments. Based on the tax returns submitted for the exceptionally profitable years 2020 and 2021, the tax set aside for both those years was paid in the financial year. The lower income for the years 2022 and 2023 means the amounts earmarked in the provisions are much lower than in the previous year.\n\n**38**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GROUP AND PROFITABILITY**\n\nThe principles and aims of financial management are explained in the section \"Management system, princi-\n\nLoan liabilities 41.697 17.913 23.784 132,8 % Other borrowings (including credit facility) 11.753 6.075 5.678 93,5 % **BORROWINGS 53.450 23.989 29.461 122,8 %** Less cash in banking accounts and cash on hand -17.139 -30.459 13.320 -43,7 % **NEW BORROWINGS FOR OPERATIONS 36.311 -6.470 42.781 -661,2 %** Provisions for pensions 1.127 756 371 49,1 % Lease liabilities 132.582 131.993 590 0,4 % **NET DEBT OWED 170.020 126.278 43.742 34,6 %**\n\nThe capital requirements of the *Hawesko Group* comprise the capital expenditure on fixed assets and the financing of operating activities as well as the acquisition of further group companies for non-organic growth.

This write-off was eliminated from the operating result for the sake of comparability and is therefore not included in the table shown above.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **CONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR B2B SEGMENT**\n\n| € '000                                                                 | 2023     | As % of sales | 2022     | As % of sales | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|---------|\n| SALES REVENUES                                                         | 207.182  |               | 200.598  |               |         |\n| Internal sales between segments                                        | 7.683    |               | 7.318    |               |         |\n| Cost of materials                                                      | -148.667 |               | -145.905 |               |         |\n| GROSS PROFIT                                                           | 66.198   | 32,0 %        | 62.011   | 30,9 %        | 1,0 %P  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                     | -23.141  | -11,2 %       | -21.526  | -10,7 %       | -0,4 %P |\n| Advertising expense                                                    | -4.507   | -2,2 %        | -3.932   | -2,0 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| Commissions of partners                                                | -5.419   | -2,6 %        | -5.662   | -2,8 %        | 0,2 %P  |\n| Freight and logistics costs                                            | -15.110  | -7,3 %        | -13.760  | -6,9 %        | -0,4 %P |\n| Other costs                                                            | -8.528   | -4,1 %        | -7.991   | -4,0 %        | -0,1 %P |\n| Other income                                                           | 3.229    | 1,6 %         | 3.098    | 1,5 %         | 0,0 %P  |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECIATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING EBITDA) | 12.723   | 6,1 %         | 12.238   | 6,1 %         | 0,0 %P  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                          | -2.896   | -1,4 %        | -2.400   | -1,2 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING EBIT)                                    | 9.827    | 4,7 %         | 9.838    | 4,9 %         | -0,2 %P |\n\nThe B2B segment experienced a mixed year in 2023 in terms of sales performance. While sales to the restaurant and hotel sectors were increased, sales to food retailers and specialist retailers were below the previous year's level and fell short of expectations. The B2B segment, like the Retail and e-commerce units, had to adjust to occasionally steep product price increases by producers, but in view of its role as an intermediary it has less scope than the two B2B segments to switch out the products or move to private labels.\n\nThe statement of income for the B2B segment in the first half of 2023 still showed the effect of the initial consolidation of *Global Wines & Spirits*, following on from its initial full consolidation at 1 July 2022. That company generated sales revenues of € 11 million and EBIT of € 1 million in the first half. Disregarding this effect, like-for-like sales revenues and operating EBIT would have been down on the previous year.\n\nOverall, the B2B segment achieved an operating result of € 9.8 million and therefore a rate of return of 4.7 percent. To restore the minimum required rate of return to above 5 percent, structural cost-cutting measures were already taken in the financial year, especially in the administrative areas. These measures necessitated expenses amounting to € 0.7 million, for which the operating result was adjusted accordingly.\n\n**44**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**2022**\n\n**As % of sales**\n\n**Change**\n\n**As % of sales**\n\n**GROSS PROFIT 109.609 49,7 % 120.198 49,6 % 0,2 %P** Personnel expenses -31.920 -14,5 % -31.592 -13,0 % -1,5 %P Advertising expense -26.838 -12,2 % -30.877 -12,7 % 0,6 %P Freight and logistics costs -21.170 -9,6 % -23.500 -9,7 % 0,1 %P Other costs -16.452 -7,5 % -15.513 -6,4 % -1,1 %P Other income 2.696 1,2 % 1.980 0,8 % 0,4 %P\n\n**EBITDA) 15.925 7,2 % 20.696 8,5 % -1,3 %P** Depreciation and amortisation -4.877 -2,2 % -4.959 -2,0 % -0,2 %P\n\n**EBIT) 11.049 5,0 % 15.737 6,5 % -1,5 %P**\n\nThe units of the e-commerce segment broadly faced a challenging financial year 2023, in which the hoped-for turnaround in sales revenues did not yet come.

The vines in a vineyard do not start to bear fruit until their third year and produce their most reliable yields after around 20 years. Still older vines are generally considered a rarity and the harvest is high\n\nThe characteristics and attributes of high-quality wines in terms of taste and quality depend greatly on the local cultivation conditions as well as the methods of viticulture and vinification adopted by each producer. These may vary considerably between wine-growing region and producer. Consequently, various constantly evolving methods are used to operate in a sustainable and environment-friendly manner.

In the purchasing sphere, the Hawesko Group unceasingly encourages its suppliers to adopt eco-friendly practices and support the use of organic methods of cultivation and vinification. Many producers are receptive to this input and have their processes adapted and certified accordingly.\n\n*Jacques'* designs its shop-based business to be sustainable.

As a trader, our responsibility involves particularly the range, the shipping of goods and the packaging of consignments.\n\nThe objective of the *Hawesko Group* is to consistently reduce carbon emissions per bottle sold, thereby helping to protect the climate. For the product wine, the weight of the bottle is a carbon emissions driver that impacts the entire value chain. The lighter the glass bottle is, the lower the carbon emissions are in the manufacture, shipping and disposal of the bottle. The *Hawesko Group* has identified potential in optimising the weight of the bottle, and particularly for its private labels will look at the weight of the bottle as a priority issue when developing products in the future. In addition, pushing the establishment of the bag-in-box as an environmentally more beneficial form of packaging for wine is a strategy with which especially *Jacques'* is already a market leader.\n\nFor the shipment of goods from producers in Europe to our warehouses, we fundamentally engage only carriers that use vehicles equipped with state-of-the-art emission control and after-treatment technology. Where possible, rail or sea are used for sections of the itinerary. Shipments fundamentally use resource-friendly Euro pallets to DIN EN 13698, which can be used multiple times. Very energy-intensive air freight is virtually never used.\n\nBy using the \"GoGreen\" shipping option of DHL, the *Hawesko Group* has been offsetting elements of its environmental footprint since 2020. For parcels shipped \"GoGreen\", a surcharge is levied on the shipping cost and invested in environmental projects to compensate for the greenhouse gases generated.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nthrough the Junior Executive Programme (JEP!).

The IMF expects global real growth of 3.3 percent, having forecast 3.1 percent in October 2023. Several major industrial and emerging national economies have proved to be more robust than the experts had assumed. Global economic growth nevertheless remains below the average for the past five years. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had a generally negative impact on growth. Meanwhile the IF has downgraded its forecast for the German economy and now forecasts growth of 0.5 percent, down from 0.9 percent in the October forecast. In particular, it considers that Germany as an exporting nation is affected more than other countries by the general weakening of global trade and the high energy prices.\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the preceding quarter. Most experts expect to see it rise in the first quarter of 2024, with the labour market figures for Germany driving the upward trend. The German government expects lower economic growth of 0.2 percent for 2024, whereas GDP growth had been expected to reach 1.3 percent according to the autumn 2023 forecast. The generally weak state of the global economy due to such factors as the fallout from the war in Ukraine, high inflation and rising prices in the energy segment is holding back the German economy more than previously assumed.\n\nHouseholds' nominal disposable incomes are expected to increase in 2024 thanks to rising pay and falling inflation. This is expected to fuel consumer spending in 2024.\n\n#### *Wine market in 2024:*\n\nThe International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) estimates wine production in 2023 at 242 to 247 million hectolitres. That indicates a decline of 7 percent compared with the already below-average volume for 2022, and is prospectively the lowest level of global wine production for the past 60 years.\n\nThe European Union's production output for 2023 is estimated at 150 million hectolitres (previous year: 157 million hectolitres) but will vary from one wine-producing country to another due to the weather and the associated incidence of fungal diseases. The harvest figures for France and Germany are expected to be solid. By contrast, in some areas of Spain substantial parts of the harvest failed due to long hot spells in the summer, and in Italy due to high rainfall and vine blight.\n\n**62**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nThe Board of Management anticipates a challenging market environment for the wine-producing industry in 2024 because the high stock levels in winemakers' warehouses and cellars and rising supply coincide with a continuing decline in consumer demand. In its capacity as a trader, the *Hawesko Group* perceives an opportunity here to roll back to some extent the substantial price increases that winemakers have implemented\n\nThe established quality trends will continue in 2024 and will define the market: there is growing professionalism in the world of wine, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning, and Europe will remain a focal area of global wine consumption. The consequence of this is that the virtues the *Hawesko Group* has carefully nurtured over many decades are more important than ever as a unique selling proposition in the marketplace.

Slight growth in the restaurant trade is planned, whereas sales to food and specialist retailers will be stable or slightly down, though much will depend on the state of the economy. In the case of food retailers in particular, consumers are expected to be highly sensitive to price and it will be necessary to adjust the product range accordingly. With suppliers also recognising the need to do this, the first winemakers have already indicated their readiness to drop product prices in order to restore the price-demand function. There is also the prospect of growth for spirits by bringing new suppliers of known brand products on board. The segment's profitability should be able to improve slightly once more after a weak 2023, producing mild growth in operating EBIT.\n\nThe e-commerce segment will again serve as the clearest bellwether of consumer confidence. With logistics costs still rising, the e-commerce units are dependent on larger shopping baskets and increased trading margins. After two years of declining sales and operating EBIT, a turnaround is expected in 2024. We therefore anticipate that sales for the segment will not fall below the level of 2023 and will remain steady year on year. But to what extent the segment can achieve any stronger sales boost is very dependent on consumer sentiment.

The range of top-class wines, knowledgeable handling of the product wine, experience in specialised warehousing and shipping logistics as well as the ability to keep enthusing customers with high service commitment and quality are key to the group brands' high recognition value in the wine market.\n\n#### *Anticipated financial performance*\n\n**62**\n\nFollowing on from a challenging financial year, the Board of Management again anticipates little economic tailwind in 2024. According to its internal estimates, high (core) inflation, which is eating into real disposable incomes, as well as low consumer confidence will again dominate the market environment in which the *Hawesko Group* operates.\n\nThe Retail segment is expected to achieve slight growth in sales revenues. Perceived as a business that trades in everyday consumer goods and with smaller shopping baskets than e-commerce, this is the area affected least by consumer holdback. *Jacques'* is also planning to open further outlets and expects the newly opened stores in 2023 to stimulate growth. *WEIN & CO* is expected to achieve a substantially improved operating EBIT that will also benefit operating EBIT for the segment.\n\nThe B2B segment will face a challenging 2024 with sales on a par with the previous year. Slight growth in the restaurant trade is planned, whereas sales to food and specialist retailers will be stable or slightly down, though much will depend on the state of the economy.

Other opportunities will open up for the segment with the creation of additional marketplace platforms at *Hawesko* and *WirWinzer*. However increased road tolls and other legislative changes will keep up the pressure on freight and logistics costs. The steadily rising fulfilment costs in this segment necessitate lasting structural changes to the cost structure of the e-commerce units; these will be made in 2024. We expect the impact on EBIT in 2024 to reach around € 1 to € 2 million. However disregarding this effect, operating EBIT for the segment will increase marginally.\n\nOverall, the Board of Management expects a slight rise in sales of up to +2 percent and operating EBIT in the range of € 36 to € 40 million. There will be non-recurring effects requiring adjustment in the amount of up to € 2 million for further restructuring costs in the B2B and e-commerce segments; reported EBIT could therefore be up to € 2 million lower than operating EBIT.\n\nThe Board of Management anticipates free cash flow in the range of € 16 to € 22 million for 2024, with an operating ROCE of 14 to 16 percent.\n\nThe Board of Management will announce its assessments and expectations based on the latest developments in the customary manner in the quarterly reports and interim report.\n\n#### *Anticipated financial position*\n\nThe capital expenditure made in 2022 and 2023 on expanding the logistics centre and the two acquisitions in the B2B segment resulted in a substantial rise in borrowings in 2023. This increased indebtedness and an elevated interest level mean the *Hawesko Group* will continue to face higher interest charges in 2024. It therefore plans to reduce indebtedness in 2024 and in particular to reduce the average tied-up capital and the associated interest costs. It also aims to minimise above all the inventory levels in 2024 as a means of generating extra cash flow to clear debt.\n\nAlongside this, ongoing cash flow will be used for essential capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and for dividend payments. The current plans do not envisage substantial longterm investments or acquisitions.\n\n#### *Overall statement on the anticipated development of the group*\n\nIn light of the individual factors outlined and its assessment of how the wine market will develop, the Board of Management considers a steady upward development in the *Hawesko Group* to be achievable. It continues to attach high priority to sales growth. The Board of Management also wants growth to be profitable. Consistently exceeding a return on capital employed (operating ROCE) of 14.0 percent remains an important benchmark.\n\n#### **OPPORTUNITIES REPORT**\n\nOpportunities mean potential positive departures from the expected economic environment and the economic situation of the *Hawesko Group* as outlined in the report on expected developments.

The application of uniform recognition and measurement principles for the companies included in the consolidated financial statements, taking account of the requirements of the IFRS, is assured in the *Hawesko Group*.\n\nThe general organisation of the Accounting department and the involvement of the divisions participating in the processes that are relevant for financial reporting purposes are handled in such a way that there is an appropriate degree of separation between approval, executive, invoicing and controlling functions for a company of this size and sphere of activity. This separation of functions enables extensive preventive and disclosing controls in all material business processes throughout the group that have been implemented by the man\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nagement, based on an assessment of the inherent risk of the individual processes and the controlled environment in question. The manual controls are supplemented by corresponding IT process controls and IT authorisation concepts.\n\nComplex questions of measurement such as are needed e.g. for measuring provisions for pensions or derivative financial instruments, or for performing purchase price allocations, are examined in consultation with external independent specialists.\n\n#### *The ICS in respect of the consolidation process*\n\nThe processes that are relevant for financial reporting purposes are recorded in local standard bookkeeping systems for the separate financial statements of the subsidiaries. For preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the separate financial statements as well as supplementary standardised information are fed into consolidation software, using a corresponding authorisation concept, and examined by Group Accounts. The ICS of *Hawesko Holding SE* is designed to ensure that financial reporting by the company and by all companies included in the consolidated financial statements is uniform and in agreement with the legal and statutory requirements as well as internal guidelines.\n\nAll consolidation processes and the reconciliation of the local separate financial statements with IFRS financial reporting standards are carried out and documented by the Corporate Finance central department. A lease accounting tool is used to handle accounting in accordance with IFRS 16. The internal and external data required for the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report is also evaluated and consolidated at group level using a newly introduced, mainstream tool. The effectiveness and adequacy of Group Accounting in preparing the accounts are overseen directly by the Chief Financial Officer or the individuals appointed by him to perform that task within Group Accounts.\n\n#### *Evaluation of appropriateness and effectiveness (unaudited management report section)*\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 2022 (GCGC) the Board of Management has given in-depth consideration to the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk and compliance management system and of the internal control system. It has taken steps to unlock identified potential for improvements and to continue improving processes and systems. At the date of reporting, in all material respects there is no evidence of any general lack of appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.\n\n#### *Risks*\n\nIn addition to the general business risk, the group is exposed to the risks explained in the following. Over a one-year horizon these are classified in the basic scenario in descending order as A, B and C risks depending on the anticipated loss. Please refer to the following diagram. The losses stated are a net view with the impact on EBIT.

Even if such measures were to be decreed, Hawesko's Board of Management believes that an advertising ban for alcoholic products would probably not result in lower wine consumption in the medium term. Depending on what specific form any restrictions on advertising were to take, an advertising ban could nevertheless have a significant negative impact on the business operations of the Hawesko Group because particularly the e-commerce business model generates sales through regular advertising campaigns. Based on its market position and product range, the Board of Management considers that the group would barely be affected by a public debate aimed at encouraging consumption of alcohol only in moderation. The EU Consumer Rights Directive dated 25 October 2011 was transposed into German law as of 13 June 2014 through the revision of Sections 312 ff. of the German Civil Code (BGB) .

The directive affects predominantly online retailers (e.g. right of objection) and bricks-and-mortar retailers (obligation to inform). The Hawesko Group companies affected implemented it swiftly and respond swiftly to any instructions or cautions.\n\nThe risk from the public debate on alcohol and advertising bans or restrictions is classified as an A risk, with a high probability.\n\n#### *Inflation and dependence on economic cycle*\n\nEconomic development in Europe and Germany is dominated by the fallout from the war in Ukraine. It has driven up prices for such commodities as energy, fuels and food, resulting in inflation well above the levels of recent years. The Hawesko Group companies are also affected and the risk of inflation therefore continues to be considered a category A risk.\n\nHand in hand with the inflation risk and its causes as described above, based on the current assessment the risk of dependence on the economic cycle is also stated separately as a category A risk. Macroeconomic fortunes exercise considerable influence over the propensity of the population to consume and therefore over the business development of the Hawesko Group.

New market participants are entering the market and attempting to capture market shares as swiftly as possible. As such market participants do not have a customer base that has been built up over decades, nor a level of specialist expertise comparable to that of the *Hawesko Group*, they try to gain market shares through price. They succeed in this to some extent by using special offers and discounts, with the result that the high price transparency of online offers can increase the pressure on prices and margins for all market participants and erode profitability. Although this approach does not fundamentally threaten the business models of the *Hawesko Group* with their focus on expertise, service and sustained growth, it hinders the acquisition of new customers and inflates the cost of this process. The effects of more intense competition are built into the plans and risk assessments of the *Hawesko Group* entities but for a variety of reasons are not fully foreseeable. The *Hawesko Group* attempts to cushion these effects by offering an extensive product range expertly and by striving not to be dependent on individual wines or producers. Furthermore, the group subsidiaries endeavour to include unique products and specially bottled wines in their range to avoid direct comparison.\n\nThe risk from growing competition is classified as an A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Dependence on Deutsche Post/DHL*\n\nBoth for sending out advertising and customer communications and for the shipping and delivery of consignments to our end customers, Deutsche Post/DHL is a fundamental service provider for which there is no adequate substitute. The risk of dependence on Deutsche Post/DHL – especially in the event of delays, poor performance and price increases – is therefore reported as a category A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Failure of IT hardware and software*\n\nThe steadily growing share of transactions handled online, specifically in the distance-selling area, also increases awareness of the availability of the web shops operated by the *Hawesko Group*. Equally, all key business processes of necessity rely on the IT infrastructure and are dependent on its proper functioning. A failure, especially if it were for an extended period, would result in significant sales losses and have direct economic consequences. The issue of IT security and availability, especially bearing cyber crime in mind, is closely managed and updated swiftly to reflect new threat scenarios.\n\nThe risk from the failure of IT hardware and software is classified as an A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Wine as a natural product: marketability and fitness for consumption, quality, possible negative effects*\n\nWine is a product of nature which accordingly exhibits variations in quality from year to year, and also depending on variety and location, under the influence of the weather, the individual locations and the fermenting processes. This variation affects prices and influences demand for individual products. On the strength of its many years of experience in the wine market, the *Hawesko Group* is able to limit the impact of these risks, but it can never exclude them entirely.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* is not dependent on specific suppliers.

In addition there is regular optimisation of the internal processes (including with external expert support) and of the IT infrastructure. The data protection area is closely intertwined with information security, a topic that is regulated by the Compliance Guideline of the *Hawesko Group*.

High-price and premium products such as those sold by the *Hawesko Group* are no exception. While late delivery for B2B customers (resellers and restaurant trade) and to our shops may lead to lost sales, a failure to deliver goods ordered by end customers in time for a particular occasion, for example, can spoil their enjoyment of the product. Customers will remember what they perceive as late delivery or unavailable products as a negative service experience and this may prompt specifically new customers to switch suppliers. The *Hawesko Group* is therefore eager to implement intelligent purchasing management to keep as many products as possible available immediately. Alongside this, it works solely with reputable partner enterprises on the logistics side. All logistics processes focus on keeping goods traffic as efficient as possible and are constantly being refined to create demand-led logistics. Delays in delivery due to extreme weather are difficult to foresee.\n\nThe risks from the logistics area are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\n#### *Financial risks*\n\nThere exist a number of financial risks within the *Hawesko Group*. These include above all influences of exchange rate and interest rate movements, as well as the non-payment and liquidity risk. Risks from the use of financial instruments are not material for the *Hawesko Group*.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the *Hawesko Group* are importers of wines traded internationally, and as such are to a limited extent affected by exchange rate movements outside the eurozone. However imports are overwhelmingly from within the eurozone.\n\nTo a minor extent the refinancing of the *Hawesko Group's* working capital requirements is in the form of loans which are taken out at current interest rates. Dependence on interest rate movements is thus low. As part of centrally controlled liquidity management, it is endeavoured to keep sufficient funds available to the *Hawesko Group* for ongoing business and for capital expenditure. The risks from receivables are limited by credit checks and credit management systems.\n\nThe risks from the financial area are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\n#### *Personnel risks*\n\nIn many areas of the *Hawesko Group*, attracting and holding onto employees with specialist expertise is an elementary factor of long-term successful entrepreneurial development. By this we mean especially the areas of IT development, which programs web shops as well as other IT systems and interfaces, and employees with outstanding expertise in wine. Personnel risks exist especially if it is not possible to find sufficient numbers of specialists in the medium to long term due to demographic and technological change. Meanwhile inflation-led rises in consumer and energy prices could prompt (future) employees to expect higher wage or salary levels. The Hawesko Group addresses these risks by actively and effectively positioning itself as an attractive employer.\n\n**72**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nThe risks from the employee are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\nThe risks from emergency losses are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\nhigher class of risk is expected because of the self-contained nature of these risks.\n\nDespite stringent quality controls, misprints could theoretically occur in the production of advertising or marketing materials.

The shares already held by\n\nHawesko Holding SE are included in the measurement of cost at fair value. Gains or losses arising from such a remeasurement are recognised through profit or loss. Transactions that do not lead to a loss of control are recognised through other comprehensive income as equity transactions for non-controlling interests. If put options are granted in the course of business combinations, an analysis is performed on a case-by-case basis whether the opportunities and risks pass to the Hawesko Group or remain with the minority interest.

The shares already held by Hawesko Holding SE are included in the measurement of cost at fair value. Gains or losses arising from such a remeasurement are recognised through profit or loss. Transactions that do not lead to a loss of control are recognised through other comprehensive income as equity transactions for non-controlling interests. If put options are granted in the course of business combinations, an analysis is performed on a case-by-case basis whether the opportunities and risks pass to the Hawesko Group or remain with the minority interest. In the case of fair value options it is fundamentally assumed that the opportunities and risks remain with the minority interest. In that case minority interest shares are reported separately. Subsequent measurement of the put options is through profit or loss and is recognised in the other financial result.\n\nAn NCI forward was agreed with the minority interest in Vinos in the previous year. The opportunities and risks from these non-controlling interests have passed to the *Hawesko Group* with the result that the shares have been shown as acquired since the previous year and minority-interest shares in Vinos were no longer reported.\n\nAt the time of loss of control, all residual interests are remeasured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nJoint ventures are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 11. That standard makes a distinction within joint arrangements between a joint operation and a joint venture, depending on the contractual rights and obligations. According to IFRS 11 and IAS 28, joint ventures are accounted for at acquisition cost upon addition and subsequently using the equity method at the updated pro rata value of the equity capital of the investment.\n\nIntra-group sales, charges and earnings as well as accounts receivable and payable between the consolidated companies are eliminated.\n\nIntercompany results for inventories are eliminated unless they are of more than minor economic significance.\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the pro rata fair value of the acquired assets or debts assumed. Following initial recognition, pro rata gains and losses are allocated without limit, as a result of which non-controlling interests may also show a negative balance.\n\nThe items contained in the consolidated financial statements for all group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each business is active (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, which is the functional and reporting currency of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses from the processing of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at year-end rates are\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised if the asset is disposed of or no further economic benefit is to be expected from its use or disposal.

Taking the sales and management structure as the starting point, a cash-generating unit is defined as an individual company or a group. The impairment test is to be performed at the balance sheet date and then subsequently whenever there is evidence of impairment. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is fundamentally determined on the basis of the fair value less disposal costs. The fair value is calculated on the basis of future cash flows according to group planning. Discounting of the forecast cash flows is performed using a risk-adjusted interest rate. Capital market data is used in determining the risk-oriented interest rate. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the allocable goodwill is to be impaired by the difference.

If the impairment exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill, the excess amount is to be distributed pro rata among the other assets of the cash-generating unit.\n\n#### *Property, Plant & Equipment*\n\n*Property, plant and equipment* is carried at acquisition or manufacturing cost less depreciation by the straight-line method, as well as impairment where applicable. The depreciation period reflects the prospective economic useful life of the assets. In the year of acquisition property, plant and equipment is depreciated pro rata temporis. The residual carrying amounts, the useful lives and the depreciation methods for the assets are tested at least on every reporting date; if the expectations deviate from the previous estimates, the corresponding changes are recognised as changes in estimates according to IAS 8.\n\nThe acquisition or manufacturing cost includes the purchase price and directly allocable costs of bringing the asset to the location and into the required condition intended by the management, and also the estimated costs of dismantling and clearing the object and the re-establishment of the location where it is situated. If an item of property, plant and equipment comprises several components with different useful lives, the individual material components are depreciated over their individual useful lives.

The *Hawesko Group* allocates the transaction price to these components based on their relative individual order prices. Land that *Hawesko Holding SE* rents as the lessee is an exception. In such cases the group exercises the option not to distinguish between lease and non-lease components, and instead to account for the entire contract as a lease agreement.\n\nRental terms are negotiated on an individual basis and comprise a wide range of different terms.

As soon as reasonable assurance then exists, an other financial asset is recognised for outstanding grants and the carrying amounts of the sundry debt and subsidised property, plant and equipment are adjusted in line with actual construction progress. All grants received are recognised within cash flow from investing activities. In the financial year, investment grants for € 35 thousand were recognised under property, plant and equipment.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised if the asset is disposed of or no further economic benefit is to be expected from its use or disposal. The profit or loss from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the object and is recognised under other operating income or other operating expenses at the time of derecognition.\n\nThe depreciation plan for property, plant and equipment is based on the following estimates of useful life:\n\n| USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT     | Years  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Buildings                                        | 3 – 25 |\n| Technincal equipment and machinery               | 3 – 18 |\n| Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment | 3 – 20 |\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated either over their respective useful life or over the term of any lease, if shorter.\n\n#### *Shares in investments accounted for using the equity method*\n\nThe shares of the group in investments accounted for using the equity method comprise shares in one joint venture.\n\nA joint venture is an agreement through which the group exercises joint control; in this case it holds rights to the net assets of the agreement instead of rights to its assets and obligations for its debts.\n\nShares in the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, including transaction costs. After first-time recognition, the consolidated financial statements contain the group's share in the comprehensive income of the investments accounted for using the equity method until such time as significant influence or joint control ends.\n\n#### *Borrowing Costs*\n\nBorrowing costs that can be allocated directly to the acquisition, construction or manufacturing of a qualifying asset are capitalised as a component of acquisition or manufacturing cost. The *Hawesko Group* definition of qualifying assets or other assets is those where at least twelve months are needed to bring them into their intended usable or saleable condition. Borrowing costs for assets that are measured at fair value and for inventories that are regularly created or manufactured in large quantities are not capitalised. In recent years there were no qualifying assets, as a result of which no borrowing costs were capitalised. Based on the principle of materiality, borrowing costs are not capitalised this year.\n\n**103**\n\n*Leases*\n\nclude extension options.\n\nprovision\n\nthat extension options will be used.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Leases*\n\n**103**\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nreceived are recognised and a non-financial sundry debt in the same amount recognised as a liability.

The profit or loss from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the object and is recognised under other operating income or other operating expenses at the time of derecognition.\n\nThe depreciation plan for property, plant and equipment is based on the following estimates of useful life:\n\n**USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT** Years Buildings 3 – 25 Technincal equipment and machinery 3 – 18 Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 – 20\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated either over their respective useful life or over the term of any lease,\n\nThe shares of the group in investments accounted for using the equity method comprise shares in one joint\n\nA joint venture is an agreement through which the group exercises joint control; in this case it holds rights to\n\nShares in the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.

The *Hawesko Group* definition of qualifying assets or other assets is those where at least twelve months are needed to bring them into their intended usable or saleable condition. Borrowing costs for assets that are measured at fair value and for inventories that are regularly created or manufactured in large quantities are not capitalised. In recent years there were no qualifying assets, as a result of which no borrowing costs were capitalised.

Tenancy agreements are generally concluded for fixed periods of between three and ten years, but may include extension options.\n\nContracts may include both lease and non-lease components. The *Hawesko Group* allocates the transaction price to these components based on their relative individual order prices. Land that *Hawesko Holding SE* rents as the lessee is an exception. In such cases the group exercises the option not to distinguish between lease and non-lease components, and instead to account for the entire contract as a lease agreement.\n\nRental terms are negotiated on an individual basis and comprise a wide range of different terms. The lease agreements do not contain credit terms except where the leased items serve as collateral for the lessor. Leased assets may therefore not be used additionally as collateral for securing loans.\n\nSince 1 January 2019 *leases* have been recognised as a right of use and a corresponding lease liability from the point in time when the leased object is available for use by the group.\n\nAssets and debts from leases are recognised at present values upon first-time recognition. The lease liabilities comprise the present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- Fixed payments less any lease incentives to be received\n- Variable lease payments that are linked to an index, initially measured with the index at the date of provision\n- Expected payments by the group from drawing on residual value guarantees\n- The exercise price of a put option, the exercising of which by the group is sufficiently certain\n\nThe measurement of the lease liability also takes account of lease payments where it is sufficiently certain that extension options will be used.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the implicit underlying interest rate for the lease, provided this can be readily determined. Otherwise – as is the norm in the group – it is discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee. This corresponds to the interest rate that the lessee in question would need to pay if it needed to raise funds in order to acquire an asset of comparable value for a comparable period, with comparable collateral and on comparable terms in a comparable economic environment.\n\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the *Hawesko Group* starts with a risk-free interest rate and adjusts it for the credit risk of the lessee. Further adjustments in addition concern the term of the lease, the economic environment and the term of the lease agreement.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* is exposed to possible future rises in variable lease payments that could result from a change in an index or interest rate. These possible changes in lease instalments are not reflected in the lease\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImpairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount.

Lease agreements with a term of up to twelve months are considered shortterm leases. Low-value assets are all leases with a new value of less than € 5 thousand.\n\nVarious real estate lease agreements of the *Hawesko Group* contain extension and termination options. Such contractual terms are used to obtain maximum operational flexibility from the assets in use. The majority of the existing extension and termination options can be exercised only by the *Hawesko Group*, and not by the respective lessor.\n\nIn determining the term of leases, the management considers all facts and circumstances that offer an economic incentive to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options.

The net realisable value is determined as the estimated sales proceeds in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs required for disposal.

Under this approach, the expected credit losses over time are to be recognised from the point of first-time recognition of the receivables. In determining whether the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recording and in estimating expected credit losses, the group uses appropriate, reliable information that is relevant and available at no undue time and cost. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analyses that are based on past experience of the group and well-founded assessments, including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is overdue by more than 90 days. If there is a significant increase in the non-payment risk at the balance sheet date and the creditworthiness of a financial asset is also considered to be compromised, in other words if there are further objective indications of impairment, the specific risk provisioning is measured on the basis of the present value of the expected\n\n• it is unlikely that the debtor can discharge its credit obligation towards the group in full without the\n\nThe combined effect of several events may possibly compromise the creditworthiness of financial assets or\n\nThe *financial assets* include primarily cash in banking accounts and cash on hand, trade receivables as well\n\nIf the *Hawesko Group* has fulfilled its contractual obligations, a contract asset or a receivable is recognised. Receivables are recognised if the entitlement to receive consideration is no longer subject to any conditions. This normally occurs if the group is contractually entitled to invoice the customer. For trade customers, a receivable is normally recognised upon shipping of the goods because at that point the entitlement to consideration is unconditional. In other words, payment is due automatically from that point on, with the passage of time.

Transaction costs of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as expense through profit or loss.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments is dependent on the business model of the *Hawesko Group* for the management of the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset. For this purpose debt instruments are classified using three measurement categories:\n\n| AC:    | Assets that are held for the collection of the contractual cash flows, where these<br>cash flows represent exclusively interest and principal repayments, are measured at<br>amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is reported under finan<br>cial income using the effective interest method.

The impairment method depends on whether a significant increase in the credit risk exists.

Under this approach, the expected credit losses over time are to be recognised from the point of first-time recognition of the receivables. In determining whether the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recording and in estimating expected credit losses, the group uses appropriate, reliable information that is relevant and available at no undue time and cost. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analyses that are based on past experience of the group and well-founded assessments, including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is overdue by more than 90 days. If there is a significant increase in the non-payment risk at the balance sheet date and the creditworthiness of a financial asset is also considered to be compromised, in other words if there are further objective indications of impairment, the specific risk provisioning is measured on the basis of the present value of the expected losses over the remaining life of the financial asset.\n\nThe group treats the creditworthiness of a financial asset as compromised if\n\n- it is unlikely that the debtor can discharge its credit obligation towards the group in full without the group needing recourse to measures such as realising collateral, or\n- the financial asset is overdue by more than 365 days, or\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nUpon initial recognition the *Hawesko Group* measures a financial asset at fair value and – in the event of a financial asset subsequently not measured at fair value through profit or loss – the transaction costs arising directly on the acquisition of that asset.

Receivables are recognised if the entitlement to receive consideration is no longer subject to any conditions. This normally occurs if the group is contractually entitled to invoice the customer. For trade customers, a receivable is normally recognised upon shipping of the goods because at that point the entitlement to consideration is unconditional. In other words, payment is due automatically from that point on, with the passage of time. For private customers, the receivable is recognised upon successful acceptance of the goods by the customer or upon fulfilment of the shipping terms in the contract of sale.\n\n*Trade receivables* are in respect of amounts owed by customers for the goods sold in the normal course of business. These are classified entirely as current, in a reflection of their payment deadlines.

In view of the fluctuating market and economic situation, the underlying assumptions may depart from the actual development\n\nProvisions for reconversion obligations for installations in the catering outlets and for returning the leased asset to the condition required in the lease agreement are recognised in the amount of the present value of the estimated future obligations. A corresponding amount in reconversion obligations is capitalised as a component of the cost of leasehold improvements and rights of use.

The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the fair value less disposal costs for the cash-generating unit. Cash-generating units normally represent individual subsidiaries within the group. Determining the fair value in particular requires estimates of the future cash flow based on group planning. The most important assumptions on which the calculation of fair value is based comprise the discount rate, the net cash flows and the sustainable growth rate.\n\nMany leases held by the *Hawesko Group* contain extension and termination options. Responsibility for negotiating and designing leases rests with the local companies, and for that reason lease agreements exhibit a variety of contractual conditions. This gives the management of each company the necessary operational flexibility to manage its business, in other words manage the underlying lease assets, as well as the scope to respond to changing business requirements.\n\nThe majority of leases within the group consist of contracts for rental of land, office properties and retail shops. Most of these are situated in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe term of these leases largely determines the level of the lease liabilities.\n\nMost leases for retail shops feature a non-cancellable basic rental period of three to five years, which may often be extended several times in each case by between three and five years. After the expiry of the noncancellable basic rental period the lease rolls over automatically normally by a further twelve months if neither party terminates the lease or if the *Hawesko Group* exercises one of its extension options as the lessee.\n\nIn determining the term of the lease, all facts and circumstances that represent an economic incentive for the *Hawesko Group* to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option are assessed and taken into consideration. Extension options (or periods covered by termination options) are only considered a component of the term of a lease if the *Hawesko Group* is reasonably certain that it will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. Under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, exercise is considered \"reasonably certain\" if it is less than \"virtually certain\" and more certain than \"more likely than not\".\n\nAfter the start of use, the probability of exercising an option should only be reassessed if there is a significant event or significant change in the circumstances with an effect on the original assessment and those events or changes are under the control of the lessee. The *Hawesko Group* reassesses the term of a lease if an option is exercised or not exercised or if the group is under an obligation to exercise or not exercise an option.\n\nDetermination of the incremental borrowing rate to safeguard the lease liability is performed quarterly by the Corporate Finance department. The incremental borrowing rate represents the group-specific interest rate for the raising of funds with a similar maturity in order to finance the asset in question.\n\nThe measurement of inventory risks within inventories depends substantially on the assessment of future demand and of the time for which stocks of goods are held as a result, and in the case of especially high-price wine segments (primarily Grands Crus) the estimate of future market price development. For high-price wines, this estimate is made based on market price observations and on discussions with market participants (in particular the French wine commercial brokers, or courtiers).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe management creates allowances for receivables to account for expected losses resulting from customers' inability to pay.

In particular due to cyclical effects, this company has not recovered adequately from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which to some extent also affected the attached specialist retail outlets due to closures in the restaurant trade. The cross-sector downturn in consumption in e-commerce observed in the third quarter equally had an adverse effect on earnings at *Wein & Co.* We attribute the fall in e-commerce sales to continuing high inflation and generally subdued consumer confidence against a backdrop of wars and conflicts. Compounded by the pressure of costs, the planned turnaround at *Wein & Co.* was not accomplished and the company ended the financial year with a loss of € 2.5 million. We also expect the turnaround to come more slowly than planned over the next few years; for that reason the goodwill of *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million was written off in full in the third quarter. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, which after impairment corresponds to the net realisable value, is therefore € 20.8 million. According to our plans, the sales of *Wein & Co.* will rise annually by between just under 5% and 5.5% over the next four years. The plans envisage a continuing drive to reduce costs. Customer acquisition and retention costs will require an average of € 2.3 million in the years of the planning period. Planned capital expenditure, disregarding IFRS 16 capital expenditure, will be in the range of € 0.5 and € 0.9 million per year. Overall, our plans envisage a gross profit margin of 48% per year for assessing the recoverability of goodwill. If unforeseeable events result\n\nin higher costs or lower proceeds, the impairment of further assets could potentially be required.\n\nNo conceivable changes to the key parameters would lead to goodwill impairment.\n\nDespite the general decline in consumption compared with the previous year, in the other cash-generating units there are no indications of goodwill impairment because their annual results remain positive and they\n\nwere included in the tests.\n\naccording to IFRS 16 was also taken into account.\n\nwill prospectively remain profitable.\n\n**136**\n\n#### **18 RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL**\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the goodwill tested and the assumptions made in the individual impairment tests, in each case for the smallest cash-generating unit (CGU):\n\n| NAME OF CGU                                                                                | Vinos      | Wein & Co. | Wein Wolf<br>Gruppe | WirWinzer  | Global Wines<br>& Spirits | Miscellane<br>ous  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Segment                                                                                    | E-Commerce | Retail     | B2B                 | E-Commerce | B2B                       | B2B and re<br>tail |\n| Carrying amount goodwill<br>31/12/2023                                                     | 8.711      | 0          | 4.455               | 2.686      | 7.114                     | 2.877              |\n| Impairment                                                                                 | 0          | 8.197      | 0                   | 0          | 0                         | 0                  |\n| Duration of planning pe<br>riod (as previous year)                                         | 3 years    | 4 years    | 3 years             | 3 years    | 3 years                   | 3 years            |\n| Sustainable growth rate<br>per year after end of plan<br>ning period (as previous<br>year) | 0,75%      | 0,75%      | 0,75%               | 0,75%      | 0,75%                     | 0,75%              |\n| Discount rate (after-tax in<br>terest rate) 2023                                           | 7,94%      | 8,56%      | 7,94%               | 7,94%      | 8,97%                     | 7,94%              |\n| Discount rate (after-tax in<br>terest rate) 2022                                           | 7,32%      | 7,32%      | 7,32%               | 7,32%      | 8,69%                     | 7,32%              |\n\n#### **IMPAIRMENT TEST**\n\nFor purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) based on the future discounted cash flows. The measurement is treated as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because of the non-observable inputs applied in measurement. The management approach and the key assumptions in determining the FVLCOD and VIU (applied to *Global Wines & Spirits* in previous year) for the cash-generating unit are based essentially on the future cash flows anticipated in group planning over the next three or four years, depending on company, and are discounted at the balance sheet date. The key parameters here are the discount rate, the net cash flows (sales performance, customer acquisition and retention costs, investments, margins) and the sustainable growth rate. Rising net cash flows are fundamentally assumed over the detailed planning period.\n\nIn the planning period, the assumptions used for the impairment tests are based on approved corporate planning (at the level of the individual enterprises) and on externally published sources. To some extent risk markdowns have been applied for company-specific market share developments. The margins used are based on past experience and future expectations, and have been updated based on cost-cutting measures implemented. Investment ratios are based on past experience and for the planning period take account of replacement purchases envisaged for production facilities. The costs of the corporate functions were allocated to the\n\n**135**\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nindividual units according to the user-pays principle.

In particular due to cyclical effects, this company has not recovered adequately from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which to some extent also affected the attached specialist retail outlets due to closures in the restaurant trade. The cross-sector downturn in consumption in e-commerce observed in the third quarter equally had an adverse effect on earnings at *Wein & Co.* We attribute the fall in e-commerce sales to continuing high inflation and generally subdued consumer confidence against a backdrop of wars and conflicts. Compounded by the pressure of costs, the planned turnaround at *Wein & Co.* was not accomplished and the company ended the financial year with a loss of € 2.5 million. We also expect the turnaround to come more slowly than planned over the next few years; for that reason the goodwill of *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million was written off in full in the third quarter. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, which after impairment corresponds to the net realisable value, is therefore € 20.8 million. According to our plans, the sales of *Wein & Co.* will rise annually by between just under 5% and 5.5% over the next four years. The plans envisage a continuing drive to reduce costs. Customer acquisition and retention costs will require an average of € 2.3 million in the years of the planning period. Planned capital expenditure, disregarding IFRS 16 capital expenditure, will be in the range of € 0.5 and € 0.9 million per year. Overall, our plans envisage a gross profit margin of 48% per year for assessing the recoverability of goodwill. If unforeseeable events result in higher costs or lower proceeds, the impairment of further assets could potentially be required.\n\nDespite the general decline in consumption compared with the previous year, in the other cash-generating units there are no indications of goodwill impairment because their annual results remain positive and they will prospectively remain profitable.\n\nNo conceivable changes to the key parameters would lead to goodwill impairment.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Other fixtures and**  **Advance** \n\n**payments** \n\n**and

For the determination of impairment, customer groups were divided up by business model and anticipated creditworthiness. B2C receivables from consumers/end customers exist primarily in the e-commerce and Retail segments. B2B receivables are from trade customers, above all in the restaurant, hotel and specialist retail trade. For sales to food retailers, the various different customers are often billed centrally via settling agents. To reflect creditworthiness and the payment structure, the latter and the supplier receivables are measured separately. Because of the highly heterogeneous customer and supplier structure, there is no high dependence on any single economic partner. The group is therefore not exposed to any notable concentration risk.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor certain trade receivables, specifically in the B2B segment, the *Hawesko Group* takes out bad debt insurance to which it can have recourse in the event of non-payment by the counterparty in accordance with the contractual arrangements.\n\nFor certain customer transactions the *Hawesko Group* uses factoring of receivables from customers. This exclusively takes the form of genuine factoring where the risk passes to the factor. The total volume in 2023 was around € € 7.6 million. At 31 December 2023 there were outstanding receivables of € 70 thousand where factoring was used.\n\nThere are also receivables from payment service providers in the amount of € 5,180 thousand (previous year: € 4,787 thousand). Based on experience and the expected future development, the need for impairment is assessed as insignificant. No impairment is therefore applied.\n\nIn determining expected credit losses, both allowances for expected credit losses and specific risk provisioning amounting to € 442 thousand (previous year: € 320 thousand) were applied for receivables with a compromised credit standing.\n\nThe expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles for sales over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2023 and the corresponding historical defaults in that period. The historical loss ratios are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on the macroeconomic factors that govern customers' ability to settle the receivables.\n\nIn respect of the trade receivables that were not yet overdue, there is no evidence at the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment commitments. No impairment is applied to these receivables because they are assessed as insignificant. There was no renegotiation with debtors on the extending of payment deadlines.\n\nThe impairment on trade receivables developed as follows:\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nOverdue by more than 365\n\ndays **Total**\n\nOverdue by more than 90 days\n\nThe following table shows the maturity structure of trade receivables at the 2022 reporting date:\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,5% 54,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,2% 50,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,05% 10,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,1% 15,0% 15,0%\n\nNot overdue or overdue by 1 to 90 days\n\nsand 5.892 86 154 6.132 Expected loss in € thousand -24 -71 -121 -216\n\nsand 9.009 78 80 9.167 Expected loss in € thousand -12 -46 -72 -130\n\nsand 21.432 30 48 21.510 Expected loss in € thousand -9 -3 -40 -52\n\nsand 7.939 68 49 8.056 Expected loss in € thousand -7 -9 -6 -22 **TOTAL RECEIVABLES OF GROUP 44.272 262 331 44.865 TOTAL EXPECTED DEFAULTS -52 -129 -239 -420**\n\nThe simplified impairment model is applied based on past data.

The impairment of the long-term loan is treated as an expected credit loss and posted as such in the statement of income.\n\nIn view of the short-term nature of the other receivables, their carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. Within the long-term receivables, the fair values equally do not differ significantly from the carrying amounts. The fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost used for reconciliation purposes is determined by discounting based on a market rate that is appropriate for the risk and with a matching maturity.\n\nThe loans and purchase price deferrals at 31 December 2023 essentially comprise the receivable from the purchase price payment from the sale of the shares in the company *Ziegler*, which has not yet accrued at the balance sheet date and according to plan will accrue in 2027.\n\nIn the previous year the financial assets held as investments particularly included other investments taken out for liquidity management purposes.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OTHER NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nAt the balance sheet date there are other non-financial assets amounting to € 10,525 thousand (previous year: € 5,174 thousand) mainly in respect of deferred costs and advance payments, and measured at amortised cost.\n\n#### **NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables are shown in the operating result as impairment losses.

The aim of its financial risk management is to limit these market risks by finance-oriented activities. Selected derivative hedges are also used for this purpose. As a fundamental principle, however, protection is only obtained for those risks that affect the group's cash flow.\n\nRisk management for the *Hawesko Group* is governed in the first instance by a corporate finance department (Group Finance) based on guidelines that the management has approved. The Group Finance department identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the operating companies of the *Hawesko Group*. The Board of Management provides written principles for overall risk management as well as principles for certain areas, such as foreign currency, interest rate and default risks, as well as the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the handling of liquidity surpluses.\n\nIf all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is adopted to eliminate the mismatch in financial reporting between the hedge and the hedged underlying transaction. For interest rate risks, this results in the recognition of interest expense at a fixed rate for the hedged variable-rate loans, and for exchange risks it results in sales revenues that are realised at the hedged exchange rate.\n\n#### *DERIVATIVES AND HEDGES*\n\nDerivatives are used exclusively for economic hedging purposes, not as speculative investments. However if derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, they are classified as and recognised at fair value through profit or loss.

To assure this and in order to continue paying a dividend in keeping with the earnings per share, it is necessary to continue generating an adequate free cash flow. The sustained optimisation of working capital is a priority target.\n\nThe capital structure is managed on the basis of the net debt or net liquidity position. This is defined as the sum of amounts due to banks, other loans, lease liabilities and provisions for pensions, less cash. At 31 December 2023 there is net debt of € 170,020 thousand (previous year: net debt of € 126,279 thousand).\n\nThe operating return on capital employed (operating ROCE) is a further important indicator for capital management.

A long-term operating return on capital employed (ROCE) of consistently at least 14.0 percent is the aim. An operating rate of return of 12.4 percent was achieved in the year under review (previous year: 15.4 percent).\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **45 APPLICATION OF THE EXEMPTION RULES OF SECTION 264 (3) OF GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE FOR INCORPORATED FIRMS**\n\nThe group companies IWL Internationale Wein-Logistik GmbH, WirWinzer GmbH, WineCom International Holding GmbH, WineTech Commerce GmbH, Hanseatisches Wein- und Sekt-Kontor HAWESKO GmbH, Jacques' Wein-Depot Wein-Einzelhandel GmbH, Wein & Vinos GmbH, Wein Service Bonn GmbH, Tesdorpf GmbH, The Wine Company Hawesko GmbH, Weinland Ariane Abayan GmbH, Wein Wolf GmbH, Grand Cru Select Distributionsgesellschaft mbH and Global Eastern Wine Holding GmbH make use of the exemption rules of Section 264 (3) of German Commercial Code for the year under review.

We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with those requirements. In addition, we declare that, pursuant to Article 10 (2) letter f) of EU Audit Regulation we did not perform any prohibited non-audit services within the meaning of Article 5 (1) of EU Audit Regulation.

If intrayear impairment triggers occur, an ad hoc impairment test is also carried out intrayear. The smallest cash-generating units normally represent individual subsidiaries within the group. Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount of the smallest cash-generating unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, impairment is required. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less disposal costs or value in use of the company. The relevant date for impairment testing is 31 December 2023.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nTesting goodwill for impairment is a complex process and is based on a number of discretionary assumptions.

The war against Ukraine, risen costs for energy and continuing high inflation unsettled consumers and were a barrier to consumer confidence improving across all sectors. The *Hawesko Group* felt the generally prevailing sentiment among consumers, especially in the e-commerce segment. There has so far been no sign of the hoped-for recovery that would lead to increased online activity among our customers. The positive development of the Retail and B2B segments is therefore all the more welcome. Our Retail format *Jacques'* has attracted many lovers of wine with its approachable wine-tasting concept. In B2B business, sales to the hotel and restaurant trades generated a steady stream of demand. On the whole the *Hawesko* Group was able to assert its leading position in the intensely competitive German wine market. Sales of € 660.3 million for financial year 2023 were consequently only slightly down on the previous year's level. Amid still-challenging market conditions, at the start of 2023 the *Hawesko Group* embarked on a programme of consistent cost-cutting measures across all segments to permanently boost its earnings performance. Together with an improvement in gross profit that was also achieved through appropriate price increases, it therefore proved possible to stabilise the operating result at € 34.0 million.\n\nEven this unusual environment, the *Hawesko Group* was still able to demonstrate the strategic strength of its business model and navigated a successful course through the various risks and opportunities. The Supervisory Board believes that the group continues to be in robust health and remains confident about the medium and long-term outlook for business development.\n\n#### **INTERACTION BETWEEN BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY BOARD**\n\nThroughout the 2023 financial year the Supervisory Board performed its statutory duties conscientiously and with great care. It was informed of the situation of the company at regular meetings and in committee meetings, advised the Board of Management on key strategic matters, oversaw it throughout and took all the necessary decisions. In addition to providing regular reports, pursuant to Section 90 (1) third sentence of the German Stock Corporation Act the Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board Chair of other important matters. The reports contained the overall position of the group and current business developments as well as its medium-term strategy with investment, financial and earnings plans, in addition to the development of management. Priority topics for discussion were the economic development of the group companies and the future direction of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\nAt four ordinary meetings in financial year 2023, supported by meetings of the Audit and Investment Committee and of the Personnel and Nominating Committee, the Supervisory Board considered the strategic planning, the efficiency of the company's management and the lawfulness and adequacy of the company's management. The topics addressed included the current trading position of the group, the principles of corporate governance and their implementation in the company, personnel matters, compliance and risk management\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### within the group, and also the strategic business plans.

On the basis of the dependency report the Supervisory Board has assured itself, in the presence of the independent auditor, that *Hawesko Holding SE* has not been disadvantaged in the past financial year by actions of its majority shareholder or by transactions with it. The Supervisory Board has therefore noted and approved the opinion issued by the independent auditor and issued two declarations:\n\n- Based on the conclusive findings of its examination, it raises no objections to the declaration by the Board of Management on related parties.\n- *Hawesko Holding SE* received appropriate consideration for each transaction based on the circumstances known to it at the time each transaction was conducted or each action was taken or omitted, and was therefore not disadvantaged by the action taken or omitted.\n\n#### **SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS**\n\n|                                    | Meetings | of which in<br>person | of which<br>virtual |\n|------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Supervisory board                  | 4        | 2                     | 2                   |\n| Audit and Investment Committee     | 5        | 2                     | 3                   |\n| Personnel and Nominating Committee | 4        | 2                     | 2                   |\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **WORK OF THE AUDIT AND INVESTMENT COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Audit and Investment Committee held meetings before the publication of each quarterly financial report and discussed these pursuant to Article 7.1.2. of the German Corporate Governance Code.

The accounts of the subsidiaries for 2022 were moreover considered in the presence of the independent auditor. At the end of the financial year the audit priorities for the 2024 financial statements were defined and the three-year plan and progress with strategic projects were addressed.\n\nDr. Jörg Haas was absent from the meeting on 2 August 2023. Apart from that instance, all members of the committee attended all meetings of the Audit and Investment Committee.\n\n#### **WORK OF THE PERSONNEL AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee addressed personnel matters with managers of the company at its meetings on 12 April, 12 June, 21 September and 14 December 2023.

The Annual Report is available online at www.hawesko-holding.com. The Supervisory Board examined the efficiency of its activities by way of self-evaluation, to assure effective control of the Board of Management, drawing on the specific professional knowledge and experience of the members of the Supervisory Board. Supervisory Board members fundamentally have the opportunity to receive professional training in the context of their duties, though this option was not taken up in the year under review.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION\n\n**B.

This organisational structure is useful because the wine trade depends to a great extent on nurturing and exploiting personal contacts with both producers and customers. The parent company *Hawesko Holding SE* normally holds 100 percent or a majority of the shares in the subsidiaries, which are active predominantly in the wine trade. The significant operationally active incorporated firms within the group of consolidated companies, above all *HAWESKO* and *Jacques',* are integrated into the group by means of profit transfer agreements with the holding company. The parent company *Hawesko Holding SE* and the majority of the subsidiaries are domiciled in the Federal Republic of Germany. The subsidiaries not based in Germany are all domiciled in other European Union countries or in Switzerland.\n\ncan also be consulted by shareholders and the public on the website of *Hawesko Holding SE* at\n\nthe end of the financial year, instead of within 90 days. This assures appropriate interest.\n\n**215**\n\n#### *1. No sustainability-related objectives in the corporate planning*\n\nArticle A.1 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the Board of Management shall systematically identify and assess the risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors, as well as the ecological and social impacts of the enterprise's activities. In addition to long-term economic objectives, the corporate strategy shall also give appropriate consideration to ecological and social objectives. Corporate planning shall include corresponding financial and sustainability-related objectives. In 2021 the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* approved a comprehensive sustainability strategy, embedded it at all companies of the group and is convinced that the long-term, sustainable further development of the group is not achievable without regard for the social and environmental factors of the enterprise's activities. The multi-year plan for the years beyond 2023 does not yet contain any non-financial or sustainability-related objectives. The Board of Management takes account of the relevant environmental and social factors in all entrepreneurial decisions, within its wider assessment, but believes it is reasonable always to consider all possible factors when reaching entrepreneurial decisions, without treating certain aspects as fundamentally more important than others.\n\n#### *2. No sustainability-related objectives in the internal control system and the risk management system*\n\nArticle A.3 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the internal control system and the risk management system shall also cover sustainability-related objectives, unless in any case required by law. This shall include processes and systems for collecting and processing sustainability-related data. As explained under Article 1, the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* has not previously approved any non-financial or sustainability-related objectives as part of the multi-year plan and has therefore not captured any firm non-financial or sustainability-related objectives in the internal control system and the risk management system. However its overall risk assessment identifies and assesses all risks, so environmental and social risks are likewise given consideration.\n\n#### *3. No stipulation of an age limit for service on the Supervisory Board*\n\nArticle C.2 of GCGC 2022 recommends stipulating an age limit for service on the Supervisory Board. Until now, the Supervisory Board of *Hawesko Holding SE* has not specified an age limit for serving on the Supervisory Board. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the decision on whether to remain a member is best left to the individual Supervisory Board member. An age limit to serving on the Supervisory Board would result in inappropriate restrictions.\n\n#### *4. Independence of the Chair of the Audit Committee*\n\nArticle C.10 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the Chair of the Audit Committee shall be independent of the controlling shareholder. The Chair of the Audit Committee Thomas R. Fischer, in his capacity as Board of Management member of Marcard, Stein & Co. AG, has business relations with Tocos Beteiligung GmbH (a major shareholder of *Hawesko Holding SE*) and with Detlev Meyer (Chair of the Supervisory Board of *Hawesko Holding SE*) and is therefore not independent of the controlling shareholder. The Supervisory Board is nevertheless convinced that Mr. Thomas R. Fischer is in every respect suited to the position of Chair of the Audit Committee in light of his qualifications, and bases his actions on the interests of the *Hawesko Group*.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *5.

From among its members it elects a person to act as Chair, and one or more Deputy Chairs. Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board are issued by the person acting as Chair or, if they are prevented from attending, by their Deputy. The Supervisory Board has a quorum if all members have been invited and at least half of the members take part in the vote. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are carried by a simple voting majority, unless otherwise specified by law or the articles of incorporation. In the event of a tied vote, a majority may resolve to conduct a fresh debate; otherwise a new vote must be held without delay. When voting anew on the same matter, the Chair has two votes if the result is once again a tie.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has formed two committees that perform the functions assigned to them on behalf of the whole Supervisory Board. The committees are convened by the person acting as their Chair and meet as often as is deemed necessary. There is currently a Personnel and Nominating Committee, and also an Audit\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee prepares the personnel decisions to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board, attends to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management, and also pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. It prepares the passing of resolutions by the whole Supervisory Board on the determination of Board of Management remuneration and the review of the remuneration system for the Board of Management, and deals with Board of Management contracts unless the German Stock Corporation Act specifies that they must be concluded, amended and terminated by the whole Supervisory Board. In addition, it proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the election of Supervisory Board members by the Annual General Meeting, taking into account the statutory requirements, the recommendations of GCGC and the requirements profile for the Supervisory Board resolved by the Supervisory Board. In doing so, in each case it assures itself that the person candidating is able to set aside the anticipated time required.

The Board of Management uses sales growth, operating EBIT, ROCE and free cash flow as the basis for its management approach.\n\nThe target minimum rates of return are presented in the \"Management system\" section of the combined management report. The targets and the development of the individual segments based on these benchmarks form part of the regular strategy and reporting discussions with the managing directors of the individual group companies. By incorporating EBIT margins and the return on capital employed into the objectives and target attainment checks, responsibility is clearly apportioned to the managing directors below Board of Management level.\n\nSince 1 January 2011 a compliance code passed and regularly reviewed by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board has been in place for all *Hawesko* group companies. The code of conduct for employees and the social media guidelines can be accessed at https://www.hawesko-holding.com/ueber-uns/corporate-governance/.\n\n#### *II. Shareholders and Annual General Meeting*\n\nThe shareholders of Hawesko Holding SE exercise their right to have a say in the running and supervision of the company through the Annual General Meeting. All shares are no par value bearer shares equipped with identical rights and obligations. Every share in Hawesko Holding SE carries one vote. The principle of \"one share, one vote\" is taken to its logical conclusion, as there are no caps on the number of voting rights which may be held by one shareholder, nor any special voting rights. Every shareholder is entitled to take part in the Annual General Meeting, to comment there on the individual agenda items and to demand information on matters concerning the company, to the extent that this is needed for the correct assessment of a matter being brought before the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting is held during the first six months of each financial year. Chairing of the Annual General Meeting is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board Chair or another member of the Supervisory Board nominated by the Chair. The Annual General Meeting fulfils all the tasks assigned to it by law. A resolution shall normally be carried by a simple majority or, in certain cases (including for resolutions on capital measures and amendments to the articles of incorporation) by a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented.\n\nDetlev Meyer is a Supervisory Board member and the biggest shareholder of Hawesko Holding SE, holding 72.6 percent of the shares through Tocos Beteiligung GmbH. There then follow the heirs of Michael Schiemann, with a 5.6 percent shareholding via Augendum Vermögensverwaltung GmbH. The remaining approx. 21.8 percent are held by institutional and private investors. There are no employee shares within the meaning of Sections 289a (1) first sentence No. 5 and 315a (1) first sentence No. 5 HGB.\n\n#### *III. Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises and oversees the Board of Management. To conduct important and fundamental transactions, the Supervisory Board must first give its consent by a two-thirds majority specifically to individual investments of a value of more than € 2.5 million and to the acquisition of other companies or the disposal of investments in companies with a value of more than € 0.5 million. A reporting system informs the Supervisory Board members monthly of key financial data compared with the target and prior-year figures,\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nand explains these. At least four ordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board as well as meetings of its committees take place each year.\n\nAccording to the articles of incorporation the Supervisory Board comprises six members, elected by the Annual General Meeting.

Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board are issued by the person acting as Chair or, if they are prevented from attending, by their Deputy.

The targets and the development of the individual segments based on these benchmarks form part of the regular strategy and reporting discussions with the managing directors of the individual group companies. By incorporating EBIT margins and the return on capital employed into the objectives and target attainment checks, responsibility is clearly apportioned to the managing directors below Board of Man-\n\nSince 1 January 2011 a compliance code passed and regularly reviewed by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board has been in place for all *Hawesko* group companies. The code of conduct for employees and the social media guidelines can be accessed at https://www.hawesko-holding.com/ueber-uns/corporate-gov-\n\nThe shareholders of Hawesko Holding SE exercise their right to have a say in the running and supervision of the company through the Annual General Meeting. All shares are no par value bearer shares equipped with identical rights and obligations. Every share in Hawesko Holding SE carries one vote. The principle of \"one share, one vote\" is taken to its logical conclusion, as there are no caps on the number of voting rights which may be held by one shareholder, nor any special voting rights. Every shareholder is entitled to take part in the Annual General Meeting, to comment there on the individual agenda items and to demand information on matters concerning the company, to the extent that this is needed for the correct assessment of a matter being brought before the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting is held during the first six months of each financial year. Chairing of the Annual General Meeting is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board Chair or another member of the Supervisory Board nominated by the Chair. The Annual General Meeting fulfils all the tasks assigned to it by law. A resolution shall normally be carried by a simple majority or, in certain cases (including for resolutions on capital measures and amendments to the articles of incorporation)\n\nDetlev Meyer is a Supervisory Board member and the biggest shareholder of Hawesko Holding SE, holding 72.6 percent of the shares through Tocos Beteiligung GmbH. There then follow the heirs of Michael Schiemann, with a 5.6 percent shareholding via Augendum Vermögensverwaltung GmbH. The remaining approx. 21.8 percent are held by institutional and private investors. There are no employee shares within the meaning\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises and oversees the Board of Management. To conduct important and fundamental transactions, the Supervisory Board must first give its consent by a two-thirds majority specifically to individual investments of a value of more than € 2.5 million and to the acquisition of other companies or the disposal of investments in companies with a value of more than € 0.5 million.

Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board has formed two committees that perform the functions assigned to them on behalf of the whole Supervisory Board. The committees are convened by the person acting as their Chair and meet as often as is deemed necessary. There is currently a Personnel and Nominating Committee, and also an Audit and Investment Committee, each comprising three members.\n\na) Personnel and Nominating Committee\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee prepares the personnel decisions to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board, attends to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management, and also pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. It prepares the passing of resolutions by the whole Supervisory Board on the determination of Board of Management remuneration and the review of the remuneration system for the Board of Management, and deals with Board of Management contracts unless the German Stock Corporation Act specifies that they must be concluded, amended and terminated by the whole Supervisory Board. In addition, it proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the election of Supervisory Board members by the Annual General Meeting, taking into account the statutory requirements, the recommendations of GCGC and the requirements profile for the Supervisory Board resolved by the Supervisory Board. In doing so, in each case it assures itself that the person candidating is able to set aside the anticipated time required. On personnel affairs, the committee also has the task of examining the appointment or dismissal of senior executives of the group to establish whether such actions serve the interests of early and balanced succession planning.\n\nThe Chair of the Personnel and Nominating Committee is Detlev Meyer. The other members are Wilhelm Weil and Kim-Eva Wempe.\n\n#### b) Audit and Investment Committee\n\n**216**\n\nThe Audit and Investment Committee deals with the supervision of accounting, the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the auditing of financial statements. It also prepares the resolution proposal of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting on the election of the auditors. If there is the intention to rotate auditors, the Audit and Investment Committee is responsible for the selection process.

The Supervisory Board considers that diversity aspects, alongside the specialist skills and experience of the Board of Management members, play an important role in the sustainable development of the company. A variety of personalities, experience and knowledge avoids groupthink, allows a rounded view and thus enriches the work of the Board of Management.

In view of the modest size of the Board of Management and the generally limited pool of suitable candidates, it is nevertheless not always possible to assure equal numbers of women and men. The legislator plans not to oblige an enterprise with a three-member Board of Management to include a woman among the members.

A variety of backgrounds in education, profession and experience is therefore expressly desired.

Modus operandi of the Board of Management*\n\nThe Board of Management is independently responsible for the running of the company and represents it in transactions with third parties. It coordinates the strategic direction of the group with the Supervisory Board and, in accordance with the legal requirements, informs the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively of all matters of relevance to the company with regard to planning, business developments and risks. The work of the Board of Management is set out in more detail in rules of procedure for the Board of Management.\n\nThe Board of Management reaches its decisions by a simple voting majority. The Board of Management members are responsible for their defined portfolio and area of work according to the allocation of duties schedule, independently of their collective responsibility for the management of the group. At the same time, the Board of Management members work together collegially and continually inform each other of important measures and events in their areas of work.\n\nWhen filling management functions in the Hawesko Group, the Board of Management strives for diversity and in the long term seeks a gender balance that reflects the employee structure.\n\nConflicts of interest of Board of Management members are to be disclosed without delay to the person holding the position of Chair of the Supervisory Board. The remaining Board of Management members are equally to be informed of the matter. Board of Management members may only take up secondary occupations, in particular non-executive directorships of companies outside the group, with the consent of the Supervisory Board. Material transactions between the group companies on the one hand and the Board of Management members as well as parties related to them on the other require the consent of the Supervisory Board.

Diversity concept for the Board of Management*\n\nAccording to Article 7 of the articles of incorporation, the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* comprises at least two persons. The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board. The latter attends to long-term succession planning together with the Board of Management and pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. In the interests of tailoring diversity aspects more accurately, the Supervisory Board approved a diversity concept for the Board of Management in April 2018 and supplemented this diversity concept in April 2023 with essential expertise in sustainability in light of the provisions of GCGC 2022.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### a) Objective of the diversity concept\n\nThe Board of Management performs the pivotal role in the further development of *Hawesko Holding SE* and of the group. The Supervisory Board considers that diversity aspects, alongside the specialist skills and experience of the Board of Management members, play an important role in the sustainable development of the company. A variety of personalities, experience and knowledge avoids groupthink, allows a rounded view and thus enriches the work of the Board of Management. The following diversity aspects serve as guidelines for long-term succession planning and the selection of suitable candidates.\n\n#### b) Diversity aspects\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nFurther information on the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as on its work alongside the Board of Management in the period under review is provided in the report of the Supervisory Board.

Diversity concept for the Board of Management* \n\nlight of the provisions of GCGC 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board seeks a composition for the Board of Management where the members complement each other in terms of their personal and professional background, experience and specialist knowledge, so that the Board of Management as a whole can draw on as wide as possible a range of experience, knowledge and skills. Notwithstanding the following diversity aspects, the Supervisory Board is convinced that an allround appraisal of each individual is the only basis for appointment to the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\n#### (i) Proportion of women on the Board of Management\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes the equal participation of women and men as its basis for the composition of the Board of Management and actively promotes that goal, including by specifically searching for female candidates to join the Board of Management. In view of the modest size of the Board of Management and the generally limited pool of suitable candidates, it is nevertheless not always possible to assure equal numbers of women and men. The legislator plans not to oblige an enterprise with a three-member Board of Management to include a woman among the members. Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board has set a proportion of 0 to 35 percent as the target level for women on the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*, to be achieved by 30 June 2026.\n\n#### (ii) Educational and professional background\n\nDiversity on the Board of Management is also reflected in the individual horizons of training and experience as well as in the variety of career backgrounds of its members (for example, industry experience). A variety of backgrounds in education, profession and experience is therefore expressly desired. Every Board of Management member must, however, be equipped to perform the duties of a Board of Management member in an internationally active, listed enterprise on the strength of their personal and specialist competencies, and to uphold the public image of the *Hawesko Group*. The members of the Board of Management should moreover possess an in-depth understanding of the business of the *Hawesko Group* and generally possess several years of leadership experience. In addition, with regard to the group's business model at least one member should possess particular expertise in each of the following areas, bearing in mind that this expertise need not necessarily have been acquired through university studies or another form of training; it may also have been acquired by other means or within the *Hawesko Group*:\n\n• Strategy and strategic leadership\n\n**222**\n\n• Logistics business including the relevant markets and customer requirements\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**D.

The Board of Management comprises individuals with a variety of career backgrounds and horizons of experience, and possesses expertise in the areas stated. The defined target for the proportion of women is met. The Supervisory Board as well as its Personnel and Nominating Committee will take account of the above diversity aspects as part of their long-term succession planning and in their search for suitable candidates for the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\n#### (v) Succession planning\n\nAccording to Article B.2 of GCGC 2022, the Supervisory Board is to attend to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management. For that reason, it is envisaged that on personnel matters the Personnel and Nominating Committee must approve the appointment or dismissal of senior executives on the first tier below Board of Management or of the managing directors of group companies. In addition, either the Supervisory Board or one of its committees regularly invites prominent, key people from the *Hawesko Group* to attend its meetings as guests, and to discuss with them current business developments that affect their specific area. This approach enables the Supervisory Board to regularly form its own, direct impression of especially important management functions, incorporating both personal and professional perspectives. Furthermore, group-wide, internal management development programmes were implemented in recent years so that key positions within the group can increasingly be filled internally.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **D.

The *Hawesko Group* maintained sales at a very high level, underscoring our ambition to play a defining role in the European wine trade thanks to our critical mass.\n\nThe uncertainty in the global economy and above all high domestic inflation had already undermined economic development and consumer spending in Germany in the previous year. Sadly there were no signs of a much-needed trend reversal throughout the entire course of 2023. The German Wine Institute thus reported a year-on-year downturn in per capita wine consumption. Ultimately thanks to our ample portfolio of diverse business models across different segments, we are pleased to report that the *Hawesko Group* performed better than the market. While sales in the e-commerce segment declined slightly, the Retail and B2B areas both enjoyed sales growth, which consequently enabled the *Hawesko Group* to outstrip the performance of the market as a whole. A key factor is that we attach huge importance to fulfilling the wishes of our customers by listening to them and keeping our finger on the pulse of the world of wine. As a result we continue to be perceived as a highly attractive place to shop, with an exceptional range and outstanding service. That ultimately lets the customer wholeheartedly enjoy the extensive range of wines supplied by the *Hawesko Group,* whether at home, with friends or when dining out.\n\nOur strong positioning is founded on the twin pillars of innovation and continuing development, irrespective of whether these processes are driven by our own initiatives or in close cooperation with the winemakers. We develop trends – or pick up on them – and collaborate with the winemakers in implementing them for new or established private\n\nlabel wines and exclusive products. We also identify what our customers prefer and want, and put our heart and soul into meeting those wishes. We then find contemporary, inspiring ways to present these concepts in our wide range of shops. Specifically our in-store tastings with expert advice, for instance at *Jacques'* with its explicit invitation to \"Come in and taste\" or our appearances at various events, prove effective at engaging our customers.\n\nOur counterpart approach in e-commerce with the very extensive range – *HAWESKO* carries over 6,000 wines, for example – highlights our remarkable expertise in wine. Artificial intelligence enables us to provide personalised advice for our customers and propose suitable products. Both approaches to how we support the decision-making process, whether in-store or online, create high loyalty and help people identify with the *Hawesko Group*. Every day we are motivated by the ambition to create special moments to savour.\n\nAmid all this, we *Hawesko Group* and our winemakers have had to adjust to further cost increases in almost every area of sourcing products and services. Even if this development had broadly been expected and could be built into our plans, it demanded a huge effort on the part of management to resist the pressure of costs and develop and implement ways of cushioning or compensating for it. We have exercised strict cost discipline, but also sought to increase internal productivity or ensure that price rises do not inhibit customer purchases and have therefore gone some way towards offsetting these effects. Huge commitment and a willingness to question the status quo and implement change have made possible these vital steps towards creating leaner processes in the future. Our systematic price adjustments, which have included restructuring the range, can be considered a success given that our customers display high price sensitivity.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2024, we are not expecting any fundamental turnaround in the market conditions; we do not expect consumers of wine to show an increased inclination to buy, nor will the cost situation ease. At the same time, we nevertheless anticipate growth in sales and earnings. We are in a position to adjust readily to the prevailing economic situation and to let the passage of time work in our favour. To that end, we have drawn up and implemented measures for practically every area, from purchasing to sales. As well as paying particular care to how we select and present products, we are adopting leaner processes, making use of AI, increasing automation and steadily refining how we present the offering along every channel.\n\nWe also aim to build on our existing concepts and expand our market position. That encompasses everything from opening additional Retail outlets to stepping up our successful e-commerce activities. The launch of the *WirWinzer* concept as part of our expansion into further European countries now gives local winemakers the chance to offer their products in the countries in which we are already established. This has added a fresh dimension to our wide range of options for e-commerce. And 2024 will bring another highlight: campaigns at *Jacques'* and *HAWESKO* to mark their 50th and 60th anniversaries respectively are bound to delight our customers and lend extra momentum to our business development.\n\nAmid all this, it is clear to us that our group of companies can only succeed if it operates in tandem with its various partners in a way that brings added value – starting with our customers and the winemakers. Above all, we acknowledge our employees as our most precious asset. With their immense passion, deep commitment, unique expertise and sheer professionalism, they are able to serve the wider interests of people, the natural world and the environment in our sphere of influence and activity, and do so with responsibility. Ultimately that is the only way we will meet our own expectations and\n\nachieve the standards of sustainability and longterm orientation that serve as our benchmark. Going forward, we therefore want to remain an approachable group of companies that is relatable for our customers and partners, nurtures a culture of personal contact and offers excellent wine expertise. We will continue to actively shape the premium wine trade in Europe and be a leading player. Further potential corporate acquisitions will also bolster our market position. In 2023, we for example acquired a 50 percent stake in the Eastern European *Dunker Group* in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Major capital expenditure on the expansion and modernisation of our e-commerce logistics will also give us an edge, going forward.\n\nEven in these exceptional times we want you, our shareholders, to participate suitably in our corporate success. At the same time we are focusing on creating the best possible basis for our company to operate just as effectively in the market. We and the Supervisory Board therefore propose a dividend of €1.30 per share. This reduction in the dividend compared with the previous year reflects the economic situation and gives us future scope to remain a self-sufficient market operator that is ahead of the curve.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/5 description: A close-up shot shows a vine with several green leaves against a white background.

Thank you to all the winemakers who have continued to entrust their exclusive products to us, and to all partners who have provided us with their valued services. Last but not least, we should thank our many loyal customers.\n\nWe look forward to shaping the future development of the *Hawesko Group* with you at our side, and to extending our leading market position.\n\nThe Board of Management\n\nThorsten Hermelink, Alexander Borwitzky, Hendrik Schneider\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/0 description: This image is a framed picture of a variety of fruits and nuts, along with a glass of white wine.

We bring together enterprising premium formats, each of which has its own clear profile and an established market position.\n\nWe bring together a network of independent companies as a group under the three segments e-commerce, Retail and B2B, enabling us to offer a single portfolio that covers all sales channels. We consequently always have a presence precisely where our customers are minded to look for the right wines to enjoy at life's special moments – with a local, customer-focused emphasis. That is something all the companies of the *Hawesko Group* achieve to an admirable degree; in doing so they play a crucial role in making us Germany's premium and luxury-segment market leader with around a 25 percent share of the market – and Europe's No. 1 premium wine trader.\n\nPutting the customer at the heart of all our decisions and actions – that is the fundamental principle of the *Hawesko Group.* Whether operating out of a garage in Hamburg in 1964 or from a rough-andready shop in Düsseldorf in 1974, we have always remained true to this idea. It still remains the very\n\nTYPICAL AROMAS pineapple • grapefruit • vanilla • hazelnut • roast aromas • gooseberry caramel • apple • papaya • lemon • star fruit\n\nChardonnay\n\nbasis of our success today. With our deep roots in the world of wines, we offer exceptional expertise at every level. The closeness and sense of partnership with the winemakers that has been built up over many years puts us at a unique advantage. As indeed do our teams of wine experts, who spot trends sooner than others and come up with the perfect response. Last but not least, our group benefits from decades of experience and data-based knowledge of what our customers want.\n\nAll these factors help us achieve our overriding goal: to carve out a competitive advantage by offering exclusive products and targeting customers in a differentiated manner. Our reward? Commercial success and a high level of satisfaction among our clientele.\n\nWith this business model, we have become Europe's No. 1 trader of premium wine and continue to build on this position with our relish for innovation.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n# E-COMMERCE\n\nThe trend towards a convenient shopping experience from home continues,\n\n#### including in the wine sector: around 40 percent\\* of all premium-end wines are already bought online.\n\nWe are excellently positioned online with our e-commerce companies, and as Germany's biggest online retailer with sales of €220 million we have very good coverage of the relevant markets and customer segments. It helps that we know the individual requirements and demands of our customers, in conjunction with our taste algorithm, our powerful, scalable digital commerce platform and our carefully targeted marketing campaigns. The use of AI technologies enables us to handle processes more efficiently and with better outcomes for the customer. So however impersonal e-commerce may seem, we are actually very close to our clientele, who we can impress with an extraordinarily diverse product range of over 50,000 different wines, an excellent knowledge of wine and a delightful succession of new wines that taste sensationally good.\n\nOur six companies in this segment operate under a variety of formats and are the embodiment of choice and quality in the world of wine. Each of our formats has its own unique strategy and emphasis, and each one is a dependable supplier of premium wines in its specific market. In combination, they represent a strong unit that is able to serve a broad spectrum of around one million customers. Whether connoisseurs, bons vivants or novices, people who appreciate wine will find precisely the right products here. This diversification ensures everyone can make the most of their own personal wine experience.\n\nThanks to our companies' passion and expertise, wine lovers can easily discover their favourite wines and order them conveniently online. *HAWESKO* was among the first in the wine market to create an app to make the mobile shopping experience even more\n\nefficient. We offer our customers exclusive products and attractive deals and events for an enhanced shopping experience. Just a few months ago, *HAWESKO* specifically expanded its range with a marketplace concept. To date, 1,000 carefully selected wines have been added to the range. The goal for 2024 is to put another 5,000 top products on the marketplace. In the future, people looking for wine online will increasingly find we – and in some cases only we – have what they want. That will increase our visibility in search engines and secure our market lead. As well as online and through in-app purchasing of wine, our customers are enthusiastically taking up the option to consult our wine experts by phone for advice. High logistical requirements and steady growth in orders and shipments prompted us to invest in a new logistics centre. We are now able to deliver over 3,000,000 consignments punctually and damage-free to the designated recipient.\n\nWe are proud of our reputation as a leading e-commerce vendor and of our consistently superb quality and excellent service. They inspire people to trust our formats when shopping for wine – because they know they will not only receive top-class products, but also be served by experts who share their passion for premium wines.\n\n> TYPICAL AROMAS blackcurrant • woodiness • coffee beans • eucalyptus • blackberry black cherry • mint • graphite • dark chocolate\n\nCabernet Sauvignon\n\n#### **COMPANIES IN THE SEGMENT**\n\n**HAWESKO TESDORPF THE WINE COMPANY WEINART WEIN & VINOS WIRWINZER** \n\n*\\*Hawesko Group estimate*\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image shows a variety of items arranged on a white background, framed by a decorative border.

They serve up a unique shopping experience that appeals to all the senses. Our employees and retail partners are renowned for their remarkable wine expertise. At the 338 outlets run by independent agency partners in Germany and the 23 independently managed shops in Austria, they are on hand to provide individual advice, propose a tasting and help people choose their perfect favourite wines from our carefully curated range. *Jacques'* is also pioneering new standards in specialist wine retailing and has been putting the outlets forward for the sustainability mark FAIR'N GREEN since 2022.\n\nOur local omnichannel retailing includes a professional web presence for information and orders, as well as events that enable our customers to delve deeper into the fascinating world of wine, complete with the back story of the winemakers. As well as stimulating the sense of taste, regular events, tastings and wine samplings offer an intriguing insight into how the wines are made and the stories behind them. We held over 4,300 events in 2023; the inviting atmosphere gave our customers a first-hand opportunity to be inspired by the winemakers' passion and expertise. Through our events, we aim to delight people and give them an entirely new perspective on the product wine – because there is much more to it than taste alone! This concept enables us not only to offer a shopping experience, but also to create lasting memories and establish an emotional bond.\n\nPinot Gris TYPICAL AROMAS ripe honeydew melon • salad burnet • vanilla • almond • hazelnut • apple • pear • citrus fruits We run wine bars at five of our *Wein & Co.* shops. Guests there can choose from Austria's biggest walk-in wine list, simply pick the wine of their choice from the shelves and enjoy it at the bar for a small corkage fee. Accompanied by snacks, this wine experience is a tremendous way to spend the evening in good company. Once a year *Wein & Co.* customers can attend the \"MondoVino\" in Vienna, one of the biggest in-house events for wine producers.\n\nWe also cultivate ties with our customers using targeted customer loyalty measures based on our customer cards \"Mein Jacques'\" and \"Vinocard\". Card holders receive attractive benefits from their very first purchase. The scheme gives us detailed knowledge of our customers and creates a strong sense of loyalty among them thanks to our deep understanding of their requirements. With more than one million customer cards issued, we know what they are looking for and can therefore adjust our range and communications accordingly. This precise understanding of our clientele also enables us to assess very accurately where to open new shops. Based on comprehensive analyses and data, we can then identify potential locations that will appeal to prospective customers and reflect their shopping patterns. Our continuing expansion is therefore based on sound knowledge.\n\n#### **COMPANIES IN THE SEGMENT**\n\n**JACQUES' WEIN & CO.**\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# B2B\n\nAs a leading wholesaler of wines, champagnes and spirits nationally and internationally, we enjoy the profound trust of our winemakers.

The investment in the *Dunker Group* represents another important step as we unlock the emerging Eastern European wine market.\n\nOur wines are to be found on the wine lists of top restaurants, in-store and online specialist wine dealers just love selling our wines to their customers, and the high-end food trade appreciates our expert\n\nrange.

With sales of € 660.3 million and an average of 1,283 employees in the 2023 financial year, it is among the largest wine traders in the premium and luxury segment in Europe. The group comprises *Hawesko Holding SE* and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* categorises its activities under three operating units (segments).\n\nThe *e-commerce segment* concentrates on online retailing to consumers and comprises both its own trading business and marketplace concepts. The strategic emphasis is on operating its own trading business and also on operating a marketplace on which for example winemakers can sell their wines directly to consumers. The e-commerce segment's formats are each distinct in terms of theme and the ranges offered. *HAWESKO*, Germany's largest premium online wine trader, belongs in this segment, as does the online Spanish wine specialist *Vinos*. *WirWinzer* is the leading marketplace model for winemakers. At the ultra-premium end of the segment are *Tesdorpf*, one of the oldest and biggest fine wine traders in Germany, and *WeinArt*, which represents the absolute pinnacle of the wine sector as a trader of exceptionally rare wines.\n\nThe *Retail segment* comprises multi-channel trading concepts primarily in the form of consumer-facing wineshop retailers. *Jacques'*, the largest chain of specialist wine retailers in Germany, and the premium format *Wein & Co.* in Austria provide a unique shopping experience for those who love wine. In total, 361 physical shops in Germany and Austria enable customers to discover the world of wine in authentic style. At the 338 *Jacques'* wine shops (previous year: 332), the focus is on personal advice, tastings and a carefully curated product range. Customers of the 23 *Wein & Co.* shops and bars (previous year: 22) in Austria's main population centres will experience top-notch wines from all over the world, as well as moments to savour.\n\n**24**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nAbayan\n\nGlobalwine\n\nWein Wolf\n\nBalmerk (joint venture)\n\nGlobal Wines & Spirits\n\nGrand Cru Select\n\nWein Wolf Austria\n\nThe *B2B segment* brackets together various distribution companies in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Czech Republic, as well as a joint venture in the Baltics that was established this year.

With regard to product sources, the premium wine market is regional and in some cases local in nature, with a very large number of winemakers and a huge breadth of products. Premium-end wines are overwhelmingly not mass products. Rather, they are artisan products made with loving care and limited in quantity by nature and specific location. Conversely the finewine or luxury segment is an international market with worldwide demand for certain winemakers and products.

With sales of € 660.3 million and an average of 1,283 employees in the 2023 financial year, it is among the largest wine traders in the premium and luxury segment in Europe. The group comprises *Hawesko Holding SE* and its sub-\n\nThe *e-commerce segment* concentrates on online retailing to consumers and comprises both its own trading business and marketplace concepts. The strategic emphasis is on operating its own trading business and also on operating a marketplace on which for example winemakers can sell their wines directly to consumers. The e-commerce segment's formats are each distinct in terms of theme and the ranges offered. *HAWESKO*, Germany's largest premium online wine trader, belongs in this segment, as does the online Spanish wine specialist *Vinos*. *WirWinzer* is the leading marketplace model for winemakers. At the ultra-premium end of the segment are *Tesdorpf*, one of the oldest and biggest fine wine traders in Germany, and *WeinArt*, which repre-\n\nThe *Retail segment* comprises multi-channel trading concepts primarily in the form of consumer-facing wineshop retailers. *Jacques'*, the largest chain of specialist wine retailers in Germany, and the premium format *Wein & Co.* in Austria provide a unique shopping experience for those who love wine. In total, 361 physical shops in Germany and Austria enable customers to discover the world of wine in authentic style. At the 338 *Jacques'* wine shops (previous year: 332), the focus is on personal advice, tastings and a carefully curated product range. Customers of the 23 *Wein & Co.* shops and bars (previous year: 22) in Austria's main popula-\n\ntion centres will experience top-notch wines from all over the world, as well as moments to savour.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* categorises its activities under three operating units (segments).\n\nsents the absolute pinnacle of the wine sector as a trader of exceptionally rare wines.\n\n**REPORT AND** \n\n**STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP**\n\nsidiaries.\n\n*of Hawesko Holding SE for the 2023 financial year*\n\nBASIC PROFILE OF THE GROUP\n\n**MANAGEMENT REPORT**\n\nIn value terms, the premium to luxury wine market that we target in Germany and other European countries reflects the top 20 to 25 percent slice of the entire wine market. With regard to product sources, the premium wine market is regional and in some cases local in nature, with a very large number of winemakers and a huge breadth of products. Premium-end wines are overwhelmingly not mass products. Rather, they are artisan products made with loving care and limited in quantity by nature and specific location. Conversely the finewine or luxury segment is an international market with worldwide demand for certain winemakers and products. Customers in our segment of the market are passionate, hungry for knowledge and always on the lookout for a new special wine. They have high expectations of dealers and are prepared to enter into a relationship of trust with them. The premium and luxury wine market is predominantly a polypoly with its industry\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nspecific rules, characterised by diverse, long-established, trust-based business relationships, which mean the barriers to entry are high.\n\nEnjoying good wine makes a moment special. It is an expression of true zest for life and our entire passion. That passion is something we seek to share with our customers every day.\n\nWith sales of € 660.3 million, the *Hawesko Group* is already among the largest wine traders in the premium segment in Europe. In a reflection of the fragmented, local market structures that dictate the value-adding relationships with customers and winemakers, the group has a predominantly non-central form of organisation but does not neglect potential for synergy and economies of scale in back-office areas.\n\nSince 2015 the group's strategic goal has remained unchanged: \"to be Europe's largest, most innovative and most profitable wine trading group at the premium end of the market\". The overarching entrepreneurial principle within the group is always to achieve profitable growth. Overall, the group strategy comprises five elements:\n\n#### *Markets, growth*\n\nIn the 2023 financial year the *Hawesko Group* achieved the bulk of its sales – 82 percent – in Germany and 18 percent in other European countries, mainly Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and the Czech Republic.\n\nOur goal is to continue building on an already very good European market position for the group. We will do so through acquisitions and the targeted expansion of formats that are already established. The overriding goal within this is to use our high marketing expertise to gain targeted access to new customer groups through a range of retail business models, thus realising further economies of scale in both internal processes and external supplier relationships.\n\nIn Germany, the *Hawesko Group* already has a premium market share of more than 20 percent overall and in every segment. Our strategic goal is to grow faster than the market every year. In a contracting market environment that is seeing lower per capita consumption and declining customer reach (DIW, Nielsen), we again increased our market share slightly in 2023. Future growth will be generated substantially through continuing organic expansion in the segments. For example, further expansion of *Jacques'* retail space to up to 500 outlets is planned over the coming years.\n\nIn 2023 the *Hawesko Group* entered into a strategic partnership with the *Dunker Group*, in which connection it acquired 50 percent of the shares of *Dunker Group OÜ*. This extends the international activities of the *Hawesko Group* and signals its entry into the Baltic market. *Dunker Group OÜ* (\"*Dunker*\") and its subsidiaries, with sales approaching € 77 million, is one of the leading wine distributors in the Baltic States and has around 160 employees. *Dunker* has previously been led by the partnership of shareholders Andres Villomann and Arvo Kask (each 50 percent).

We apply specific performance indicators in order to obtain a dependable and transparent measure of our success. The internal management systems of *Hawesko Holding SE* and its subsidiaries support the Board of Management and executive management with managing and overseeing the group, the segments and the individual subsidiaries. The systems comprise planning, actual and forecast calculations and are based on the group's annually updated multi-year plan.

Financial reporting is supplemented by further detailed information that is needed to assess and manage business operations.\n\nAnother component of the management systems involves reports prepared annually on the material risks that the company faces, supplemented as necessary with ad hoc announcements.\n\nThe above reports are discussed at Board of Management and Supervisory Board meetings and serve as key documents for the group's assessments and decisions.\n\nThe combined management report and the financial statements of the *Hawesko Group* are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. In addition to the required disclosures and key figures, the *Hawesko Group* publishes alternative performance measures (APM) that are not subject to the above regulations and for which there is no generally accepted reporting standard. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the alternative performance measures with the aim of facilitating a comparison of its performance over time or with industry benchmarks. It does so by making certain adjustments to the balance sheet or statement of income items prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These adjustments may be attributable to differing accounting policies, heterogeneous business activities and non-recurring effects that impact the validity of these items. The performance measures thus obtained apply across all periods and are used both internally for business management purposes and externally to enable analysts and investors to assess the company's performance. The *Hawesko Group* calculates the following performance measures:\n\n- *Sales growth (nominal)*: the *Hawesko Group* targets consistently higher growth in sales revenues than for the market as a whole. Even if the overall market is not expanding, the group aims to increase sales revenues. The goal is to steadily increase the market share of the *Hawesko Group*.\n- *Operating EBIT and operating EBIT margin*: the company's profitability is gauged from operating EBIT (operating result before interest and taxes) and the operating EBIT margin, in other words operating EBIT relative to sales. The adjustments strip out non-recurring, non-operating aspects from the key figure EBIT and therefore permit a clearer picture of the company's operating performance. Aspects that justify an adjustment are specifically listed. They include gains or losses on disposals, extraordinary write-ups/write-downs and, as corrections, personnel-related restructuring costs and nonoperating, extraordinary costs from legal proceedings and corporate transactions. The switch to an adjusted EBIT figure announced in the previous year's report was made to facilitate comparisons with the reporting of other businesses in the industry and to increase transparency on non-sustainable profitability elements. The calculation of this key figure involves increasing EBIT by exceptional expenses and reducing it by exceptional income. The target for the operating EBIT margin is a minimum return of 5 percent.

It expected this development to turn the tide for sales by the e-commerce units and generate slight growth in all other segments.\n\nWhile the Retail segment managed growth of just under two percent thanks mainly to *Jacques'*, sales revenues in e-commerce declined again by nine percent. The B2B segment benefited from the continuing effects in the first half of the newly consolidated *Global Wines & Spirits s.r.o.* and therefore grew by three percent.

This brought to a halt the general economic recovery that had followed the slump triggered by COVID-19. Compared to the years before COVID-19, gross domestic product in 2023 was still 0.7 percent above the figure for 2019. The experts at the Federal Statistical Office put this development down to continuing high prices at all stages of the economic process, low domestic and export demand as well as unfavourable financing conditions.\n\nInflation in 2023 was less acute than in the previous year, rising by 5.9 percent (+6.9 percent in 2022), but was high for a second successive year. Food in particular was again affected especially by inflation rates and cost on average 12.4 percent more. Core inflation (the inflation rate excluding the particularly volatile categories food and energy) reached 5.1 percent in 2023 and therefore exceeded the level of 2022 (+3.8 percent). This key measure highlights how the inflation rate also remained high in all other categories of goods and extended across all sectors.\n\nThe consumer confidence index for Germany remained at the very low level of -27.6 in December. This indicates that consumer confidence was not quite as low as at the end of 2022, when the index was impacted especially by the leap in energy costs. There were no signs of a turnaround in 2023, with the figure in fact deteriorating again at the start of 2024. The GfK researchers attribute the poor consumer confidence to the unsettlingly high cost of living and other ongoing crises.\n\n#### *German wine market*\n\nThe German Wine Institute provides detailed information on the German wine market in its statistics on the past wine year (1 August 2022 – 31 July 2023). The figures show that for the period ending 31 July 2023 the German population again bought significantly less wine per capita, or 19.2 litres, compared with 19.9 litres in the prior-year period. Consumption of sparkling wine remained constant, however, at 3.2 litres. The customer reach of households in Germany who buy wine declined again and is now 10 percent below the level of 2019. The wine market in Germany thus finds itself in a situation where high supply collides with a continuing decline in demand. The development of falling demand at a time when supply is on the rise is affecting the entire European wine market, which is why the EU is supporting winemakers by providing grants for the processing of surplus wine into industrial alcohol.\n\n#### **OVERALL STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT ON 2023 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE**\n\nThe years 2020 and 2021, with the official restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a temporary marked shift in consumer behaviour as well as a special boom for the e-commerce and Retail segments. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a sharp rise in inflation; this had, and is still having, a negative impact on consumer behaviour and on all margin and cost positions.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn its forecast for 2023, the Board of Management initially anticipated a subdued first quarter followed by inflation returning to normal levels and an improvement in consumer confidence.

This key measure highlights how the inflation rate also remained high in all other categories of goods and ex-\n\nThe consumer confidence index for Germany remained at the very low level of -27.6 in December. This indicates that consumer confidence was not quite as low as at the end of 2022, when the index was impacted especially by the leap in energy costs. There were no signs of a turnaround in 2023, with the figure in fact deteriorating again at the start of 2024. The GfK researchers attribute the poor consumer confidence to the un-\n\nThe German Wine Institute provides detailed information on the German wine market in its statistics on the past wine year (1 August 2022 – 31 July 2023). The figures show that for the period ending 31 July 2023 the German population again bought significantly less wine per capita, or 19.2 litres, compared with 19.9 litres in the prior-year period. Consumption of sparkling wine remained constant, however, at 3.2 litres. The customer reach of households in Germany who buy wine declined again and is now 10 percent below the level of 2019. The wine market in Germany thus finds itself in a situation where high supply collides with a continuing decline in demand. The development of falling demand at a time when supply is on the rise is affecting the entire European wine market, which is why the EU is supporting winemakers by providing grants for the pro-\n\n**OVERALL STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT ON 2023 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE**\n\nnegative impact on consumer behaviour and on all margin and cost positions.\n\nThe years 2020 and 2021, with the official restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a temporary marked shift in consumer behaviour as well as a special boom for the e-commerce and Retail segments. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a sharp rise in inflation; this had, and is still having, a\n\n**30**\n\nWhile the Retail segment managed growth of just under two percent thanks mainly to *Jacques'*, sales revenues in e-commerce declined again by nine percent. The B2B segment benefited from the continuing effects in the first half of the newly consolidated *Global Wines & Spirits s.r.o.* and therefore grew by three percent. If that effect is disregarded, its sales revenues were down by just under one percent. Consolidated sales overall came to € 660 million, 1.7 percent below the prior-year figure and therefore within the corridor of the most recent forecast in October 2023.\n\nOperating EBIT of € 34 million declined by nine percent compared with the previous year due to the lower sales; it finished within the forecast range updated in the third quarter (€ 32 – 35 million). The original forecast in Annual Report 2022 was € 37 – 42 million and was not achieved mainly due to the absence of a turnaround in e-commerce. Reported EBIT is € 24 million, significantly below the prior-year level of € 39 million. This is substantially attributable to the amortisation of goodwill for *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million along with restructuring expenses totalling € 1.6 million. The figure for the previous year moreover included income of almost € 2 million as a result of winning a legal dispute.\n\nConsidering the market situation the Board of Management considers the overall sales performance to be satisfactory to good, except in e-commerce. All segments were affected by the lower inclination to spend due to falling disposable incomes, but by and large compensated for this effect by developing their positioning and product ranges. Profitability as a whole is not satisfactory. More costly purchasing terms with winemakers were balanced out by improved product control and structure. Meanwhile the logistics and shipping costs in particular are in need of optimising in all units, and existing cost structures need to be reviewed.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\n#### **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME**\n\n| € '000                                                                   | 2023     | as % of sales | 2022     | as % of sales | Change  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|---------|\n| Sales revenues                                                           | 660.280  |               | 671.482  |               |         |\n| Cost of materials                                                        | -369.934 |               | -377.831 |               |         |\n| GROSS PROFIT                                                             | 290.346  | 44,0 %        | 293.651  | 43,7 %        | 0,2 %P  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                       | -77.781  | -11,8 %       | -75.907  | -11,3 %       | -0,5 %P |\n| Advertising expense                                                      | -45.365  | -6,9 %        | -49.328  | -7,3 %        | 0,5 %P  |\n| Commissions to partners                                                  | -46.558  | -7,1 %        | -45.743  | -6,8 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| Freight and logistics costs                                              | -39.869  | -6,0 %        | -41.031  | -6,1 %        | 0,1 %P  |\n| Other costs                                                              | -43.032  | -6,5 %        | -41.521  | -6,2 %        | -0,3 %P |\n| Other income                                                             | 19.963   | 3,0 %         | 20.013   | 3,0 %         | 0,0 %P  |\n| OPERATING RESULT BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (OPERATING EBITDA) | 57.705   | 8,7 %         | 60.134   | 9,0 %         | -0,2 %P |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                            | -23.701  | -3,6 %        | -22.738  | -3,4 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| RESULT FROM OPERATIONS (OPERATING EBIT)                                  | 34.004   | 5,1 %         | 37.396   | 5,6 %         | -0,4 %P |\n\nIn Annual Report 2022 we expressed our expectations for the financial performance indicators in our management system that are the most relevant to us.

In the first half the B2B segment was still benefiting from initial consolidation effects following the majority stake acquired on 1 July 2022 in *Global Wines and Spirits, Czech Republic* (€ 11 million), and recorded a slight fall in sales with this effect stripped out. While sales to the restaurant and hotel trades were increased, there was a fall in sales to specialist retailers and good retailers.\n\nAfter strong growth stimuli in 2020 and 2021, for the second year in a row the e-commerce segment experienced a drop in sales of around nine percent. The user metrics for the online shops were nevertheless at a satisfactory level. The conversion rate and average shopping baskets were lower than in the previous year. Across all segments, unit sales fell more sharply than the general sales performance; price increases and a high-price product range compensated for this to some extent.\n\n| GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| in T€                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Germany                               | 543.552 | 560.111 |\n| Austria                               | 53.354  | 52.399  |\n| Czech Republic                        | 27.225  | 15.056  |\n| Switzerland                           | 19.782  | 21.425  |\n| Sweden                                | 8.680   | 11.184  |\n| Others                                | 7.687   | 11.307  |\n|                                       | 660.280 | 671.482 |\n\n#### **GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES**\n\nIn 2023 the proportion of sales revenues achieved by the group in Germany declined to 82 percent (previous year: 83 percent). The change is due to the contraction of e-commerce business, the customer base for which is largely in Germany. Meanwhile sales to the wholesale trade and to restaurants in Austria and Switzerland continued to rise, and also increased in the Czech Republic following the full consolidation of *Global Wines & Spirits*.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gross profit margin, which represents gross profit relative to sales revenues, improved slightly to 44.0 percent in the year under review (previous year: 43.7 percent).

The increase occurred in the Retail segment and is attributable to the increased use of credit cards by customers, meaning that cash inflows are delayed by one month.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe B2B segment accounts for around two-thirds of the trade receivables of the *Hawesko Group*. Major German food retailers in particular are generally granted much longer payment deadlines, resulting in the high receivables total. Customers in the restaurant and hotel trades are normally granted much shorter payment deadlines or must pay up front. In the B2B segment, credit default insurance is moreover taken out for most customers in the restaurant and hotel sectors to reduce the risk of non-payment. In the B2C segments Retail and e-commerce, because of the high proportion of credit card or debit card payments and the fairly small proportion of purchases on account, there is a lower level of receivables outstanding relative to sales. The *Hawesko Group* employs loan asset sales only in rare cases.\n\nIntangible assets fell by € -10.2 million to € 55.5 million. The change is principally due to goodwill impairment for *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million. Also, for the first time after several years of high capital expenditure on the digital infrastructure depreciation was applied to the new investments; this equally resulted in a planned decrease.\n\nThe property, plant and equipment and rights of use rose by € 17.2 million in the financial year. The increase comes mainly from sums invested in the expansion of the e-commerce logistics centre in Tornesch. The rights of use from capitalised lease agreements remained flat and came to € 121.0 million at 31 December 2023. For the most part the rights of use apply to rented retail space at *Jacques'* and *Wein & Co.*, as well as to office buildings.\n\nOther assets mainly include participating interests not fully consolidated, loans extended and other financial and non-financial assets. In the financial year under review this item contains investments accounted for using the equity method amounting to € 7.4 million, arising from the acquisition of *Dunker Group OÜ* and its subsequent measurement at the end of the year. This, along with higher tax receivables, produced a rise of around € 10.3 million.\n\nThe higher inventories produced a slight year-on-year increase in trade payables of € 2.7 million.\n\nThe contract liabilities are mainly in respect of points balances promised to consumers under bonus/loyalty programmes, subscription payments collected for wines not yet delivered and refunds promised to customers in the B2B segment, and fell slightly in line with advance payments.\n\nLease liabilities are in respect of future payments recognised as a liability from the tenancy and lease agreements concluded, and remained virtually constant compared with the previous year.\n\nThe decline in other liabilities is mainly attributable to lower provisions for income tax payments. Based on the tax returns submitted for the exceptionally profitable years 2020 and 2021, the tax set aside for both those years was paid in the financial year. The lower income for the years 2022 and 2023 means the amounts earmarked in the provisions are much lower than in the previous year.\n\n**38**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GROUP AND PROFITABILITY**\n\nThe principles and aims of financial management are explained in the section \"Management system, princi-\n\nLoan liabilities 41.697 17.913 23.784 132,8 % Other borrowings (including credit facility) 11.753 6.075 5.678 93,5 % **BORROWINGS 53.450 23.989 29.461 122,8 %** Less cash in banking accounts and cash on hand -17.139 -30.459 13.320 -43,7 % **NEW BORROWINGS FOR OPERATIONS 36.311 -6.470 42.781 -661,2 %** Provisions for pensions 1.127 756 371 49,1 % Lease liabilities 132.582 131.993 590 0,4 % **NET DEBT OWED 170.020 126.278 43.742 34,6 %**\n\nThe capital requirements of the *Hawesko Group* comprise the capital expenditure on fixed assets and the financing of operating activities as well as the acquisition of further group companies for non-organic growth.

For these purposes, the group finances itself largely through bank loans, lease agreements and the cash flow from current operations. Within time-unlimited credit lines for the financing of current business operations (working capital), there exist short-term credit facilities with an increased volume amounting to € 95.0 million (previous year € 70.0 million). At the reporting date these credit facilities were drawn to a level of 12.4 percent (previous year: 5.8 percent). At 31 December 2023 borrowings exceeded banking accounts by € 36.3 million.\n\nThe long-term and short-term financial liabilities consist predominantly of bank loans arranged with German banks on the basis of credit agreements, and lease liabilities according to IFRS 16. The contractual repayment obligations of *Hawesko Holding SE* under the credit agreements have been consistently met. There were no contractually agreed covenants. The existing credit facilities moreover assured adequate cash levels at all times during the year under review.\n\nLong-term borrowings include € 18 million in KfW financing agreed in 2022 for the expansion of the logistics hall in Tornesch near Hamburg; this sum was drawn in full at the end of the financial year and will be repaid as an annuity with equal instalments payable until 2032. To finance the logistics expansion, additional financing for € 8 million was taken out in the financial year with repayment in instalments by 2030. Furthermore, the acquisition of the *Dunker Group OÜ* shares was financed through the raising of loans in the amount of € 7.1 million maturing in 2028.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n€ miilion **2023 2022** Cash flow from current operations 27,0 36,8 Less outpayments for the acquisition of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment -24,9 -16,0 Plus inpayments from the disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 0,3 0,1 Less interest paid -6,7 -4,3 **TOTAL: -4,3 16,6**\n\nFree cash flow declined year on year by € 20.9 million to € -4.3 million, in a reflection of the high investment volume.

Conversely the online sales channels, including of *Jacques'* and *Wein & Co.*, failed to match the previous year's level and performed similarly to the e-commerce segment.\n\nBoth *Jacques'* and *Wein & Co.* improved their gross margin year on year as a result of price increases but in particular by shifting the product ranges towards private labels and exclusive brands. Rental and ancillary cost increases as well as pay increases awarded pushed up the total cost ratio by around 0.5 of a percentage point.\n\nThe operating EBIT for the segment came to € 19.6 million in total, up approx. € 700 thousand on the previous year's level. However *Jacques'* was the sole factor behind the positive development in EBIT. *Wein & Co.* failed to achieve a turnaround and closed the financial year with a loss of a similar magnitude to the previous year. In response to the slower turnaround and also the higher interest level, the goodwill of *Wein & Co.* amounting to € 8.2 million was written off in full in the financial year. This write-off was eliminated from the operating result for the sake of comparability and is therefore not included in the table shown above.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **CONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR B2B SEGMENT**\n\n| € '000                                                                 | 2023     | As % of sales | 2022     | As % of sales | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|---------|\n| SALES REVENUES                                                         | 207.182  |               | 200.598  |               |         |\n| Internal sales between segments                                        | 7.683    |               | 7.318    |               |         |\n| Cost of materials                                                      | -148.667 |               | -145.905 |               |         |\n| GROSS PROFIT                                                           | 66.198   | 32,0 %        | 62.011   | 30,9 %        | 1,0 %P  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                     | -23.141  | -11,2 %       | -21.526  | -10,7 %       | -0,4 %P |\n| Advertising expense                                                    | -4.507   | -2,2 %        | -3.932   | -2,0 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| Commissions of partners                                                | -5.419   | -2,6 %        | -5.662   | -2,8 %        | 0,2 %P  |\n| Freight and logistics costs                                            | -15.110  | -7,3 %        | -13.760  | -6,9 %        | -0,4 %P |\n| Other costs                                                            | -8.528   | -4,1 %        | -7.991   | -4,0 %        | -0,1 %P |\n| Other income                                                           | 3.229    | 1,6 %         | 3.098    | 1,5 %         | 0,0 %P  |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECIATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING EBITDA) | 12.723   | 6,1 %         | 12.238   | 6,1 %         | 0,0 %P  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                          | -2.896   | -1,4 %        | -2.400   | -1,2 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING EBIT)                                    | 9.827    | 4,7 %         | 9.838    | 4,9 %         | -0,2 %P |\n\nThe B2B segment experienced a mixed year in 2023 in terms of sales performance.

Disregarding this effect, like-for-like sales revenues and operating EBIT would have been down on the previous year.\n\nOverall, the B2B segment achieved an operating result of € 9.8 million and therefore a rate of return of 4.7 percent. To restore the minimum required rate of return to above 5 percent, structural cost-cutting measures were already taken in the financial year, especially in the administrative areas. These measures necessitated expenses amounting to € 0.7 million, for which the operating result was adjusted accordingly.\n\n**44**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**2022**\n\n**As % of sales**\n\n**Change**\n\n**As % of sales**\n\n**GROSS PROFIT 109.609 49,7 % 120.198 49,6 % 0,2 %P** Personnel expenses -31.920 -14,5 % -31.592 -13,0 % -1,5 %P Advertising expense -26.838 -12,2 % -30.877 -12,7 % 0,6 %P Freight and logistics costs -21.170 -9,6 % -23.500 -9,7 % 0,1 %P Other costs -16.452 -7,5 % -15.513 -6,4 % -1,1 %P Other income 2.696 1,2 % 1.980 0,8 % 0,4 %P\n\n**EBITDA) 15.925 7,2 % 20.696 8,5 % -1,3 %P** Depreciation and amortisation -4.877 -2,2 % -4.959 -2,0 % -0,2 %P\n\n**EBIT) 11.049 5,0 % 15.737 6,5 % -1,5 %P**\n\nThe units of the e-commerce segment broadly faced a challenging financial year 2023, in which the hoped-for turnaround in sales revenues did not yet come.

These measures necessitated expenses amounting to € 0.7 million, for which the operating result was adjusted accordingly.\n\n**CONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR B2B SEGMENT** € '000 **2023**\n\n**RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECI-ATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING** \n\n**RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING** \n\n**SALES REVENUES 207.182 200.598** Internal sales between segments 7.683 7.318 Cost of materials -148.667 -145.905\n\n**44**\n\n| € '000                                                                        | 2023     | As % of sales | 2022     | As % of sales | Change  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|---------|\n| SALES REVENUES                                                                | 220.331  |               | 242.397  |               |         |\n| Internal sales between segments                                               | 1.185    |               | 1.244    |               |         |\n| Cost of materials                                                             | -111.907 |               | -123.443 |               |         |\n| GROSS PROFIT                                                                  | 109.609  | 49,7 %        | 120.198  | 49,6 %        | 0,2 %P  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                            | -31.920  | -14,5 %       | -31.592  | -13,0 %       | -1,5 %P |\n| Advertising expense                                                           | -26.838  | -12,2 %       | -30.877  | -12,7 %       | 0,6 %P  |\n| Freight and logistics costs                                                   | -21.170  | -9,6 %        | -23.500  | -9,7 %        | 0,1 %P  |\n| Other costs                                                                   | -16.452  | -7,5 %        | -15.513  | -6,4 %        | -1,1 %P |\n| Other income                                                                  | 2.696    | 1,2 %         | 1.980    | 0,8 %         | 0,4 %P  |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT BEFORE DEPRECI<br>ATION/AMORTISATION (OPERATING<br>EBITDA) | 15.925   | 7,2 %         | 20.696   | 8,5 %         | -1,3 %P |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                                 | -4.877   | -2,2 %        | -4.959   | -2,0 %        | -0,2 %P |\n| RESULT FOR SEGMENT (OPERATING<br>EBIT)                                        | 11.049   | 5,0 %         | 15.737   | 6,5 %         | -1,5 %P |\n\nThe units of the e-commerce segment broadly faced a challenging financial year 2023, in which the hoped-for turnaround in sales revenues did not yet come. Sales fell by 9.1 percent to € 220.3 million. This level is still well above the pre-COVID level (2019: € 178.6 million) but fell for the second successive year. Within the segment, particularly the fine wine units *Tesdorpf* and *WeinArt* experienced a more marked downturn. By contrast, *WirWinzer* and *Vinos* by and large maintained sales at a steady level.\n\nWhile gross profit was increased slightly despite producer-end price increases, personnel costs went up by a disproportionately high 1.5 percentage points due to inflationary adjustment payments awarded in lower salary groups and in logistics. Conversely advertising expenses were lower: such activities were scaled back to reflect the market situation.\n\nThe lower sales led to a € 4.6 million fall in the operating result, with the rate of return down 1.5 percentage points. Continuing high logistics costs and rising IT costs coupled with higher personnel expenses mean profitability has deteriorated, necessitating adjustments to processes and costs in 2024.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrently none of the topics addressed in this section represents a material risk to the business activity of the group.

He collects and monitors CSR-related data, and reports on this to the full Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\n#### *Applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation*\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation represents a regulatory classification system for green economic activity and is divided into the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1.) Climate change mitigation\n- 2.) Climate change adaptation\n\n**46**\n\n- 3.) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4.) Transition to a circular economy\n- 5.) Waste avoidance and recycling\n- 6.) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the EU Taxonomy, economic activities are \"environmentally sustainable\" if they:\n\n- make a material contribution to attainment of one or more of the six environmental objectives\n- do not significantly harm attainment of the five other EU environmental objectives\n- meet the minimum protection requirements for occupational safety and human rights.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe classification of economic activities according to how far they make a material contribution and avoid harming other environmental goals is to be based on technical screening criteria. Economic activities are taxonomy-eligible if they can be matched with the description of an activity from the corresponding annexes of the delegated legal acts of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the individual environmental objectives, and taxonomy-conforming if they meet the technical screening criteria for that activity.\n\nIn November 2022 the criteria for the four last environmental objectives as well as for new activities of the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation were published in the Official Journal of the European Union. For the 2023 financial year it is now mandatory to report on all six environmental objectives. However there remain relief possibilities for the newly published environmental objectives and activities; it is therefore merely necessary to report on the taxonomy eligibility of those activities in this financial year.\n\nWe initially matched the economic activities of the Hawesko Group to the relevant taxonomy activities, and identified exclusively those activities that come under the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation in equal measure. These environmental objectives include e.g. the energy operations and selected manufacturing, transport and building sectors. Trading activities, and therefore the core business of the Hawesko Group, are still not yet covered by the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the year under review, including under the new environmental goals and activities. Activities in the value chain that do not generate sales but result in assets are equally included in the taxonomy and are reported as capital expenditures (CapEx). In light of this, only the acquisition and leasing of buildings such as office buildings and retail spaces are identified as a material taxonomy-eligible economic activity within the Hawesko Group (economic activity 7.7 in the annexes to the environmental objectives 1.) climate change mitigation and 2.) climate change adaptation).\n\nThe three reportable key performance indicators (KPIs) comprise the sales KPI, the CapEx KPI and the OpEx KPI. The provisions of the EU Taxonomy refer to the net sales revenues (€ 660 million – see section 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial for its calculation). Because the taxonomy does not currently cover any sales-generating activities of the *Hawesko Group*, no taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-conforming sales revenues or related capital expenditures (CapEx) or operational expenditures (OpEx) can be reported. For the activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" we made taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) in connection with the additions to property, plant and equipment in the amount of € 24.2 million. These taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) comprise previous capital expenditure on the expansion of the ecommerce logistics centre as well as capitalised lease agreements for retail spaces for *Jacques'*, *Wein & Co*. and *Vinos*, and office buildings. The total capital expenditure of the *Hawesko Group* comprises all additions from capital expenditure or additions from rights of use in accordance with the definition of the denominator for capital expenditure, and came to € 31.3 in the year under review. The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (CapEx) therefore represent just under 80 percent of total capital expenditure. Beyond that, we did not identify any further material capital expenditures (CapEx). To avoid double counting and in light of the very specific requirements of objective 2.) climate change adaptation, we allocate our taxonomy-eligible CapEx to objective 1.) climate change mitigation. The operational expenditures (OpEx) according to the EU Taxonomy comprise direct, non-capitalised costs in connection with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair as well as other direct expenditure on the day-to-day\n\n**48**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nmaintenance of items of property, plant and equipment, and amount to approx. € 1.0 million (previous year: approx. € 1.3 million).

The IMF expects global real growth of 3.3 percent, having forecast 3.1 percent in October 2023. Several major industrial and emerging national economies have proved to be more robust than the experts had assumed. Global economic growth nevertheless remains below the average for the past five years. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had a generally negative impact on growth. Meanwhile the IF has downgraded its forecast for the German economy and now forecasts growth of 0.5 percent, down from 0.9 percent in the October forecast. In particular, it considers that Germany as an exporting nation is affected more than other countries by the general weakening of global trade and the high energy prices.\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the preceding quarter. Most experts expect to see it rise in the first quarter of 2024, with the labour market figures for Germany driving the upward trend. The German government expects lower economic growth of 0.2 percent for 2024, whereas GDP growth had been expected to reach 1.3 percent according to the autumn 2023 forecast. The generally weak state of the global economy due to such factors as the fallout from the war in Ukraine, high inflation and rising prices in the energy segment is holding back the German economy more than previously assumed.\n\nHouseholds' nominal disposable incomes are expected to increase in 2024 thanks to rising pay and falling inflation. This is expected to fuel consumer spending in 2024.\n\n#### *Wine market in 2024:*\n\nThe International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) estimates wine production in 2023 at 242 to 247 million hectolitres. That indicates a decline of 7 percent compared with the already below-average volume for 2022, and is prospectively the lowest level of global wine production for the past 60 years.\n\nThe European Union's production output for 2023 is estimated at 150 million hectolitres (previous year: 157 million hectolitres) but will vary from one wine-producing country to another due to the weather and the associated incidence of fungal diseases. The harvest figures for France and Germany are expected to be solid. By contrast, in some areas of Spain substantial parts of the harvest failed due to long hot spells in the summer, and in Italy due to high rainfall and vine blight.\n\n**62**\n\n*COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT AND MANAGEMENT REPORT* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nThe Board of Management anticipates a challenging market environment for the wine-producing industry in 2024 because the high stock levels in winemakers' warehouses and cellars and rising supply coincide with a continuing decline in consumer demand. In its capacity as a trader, the *Hawesko Group* perceives an opportunity here to roll back to some extent the substantial price increases that winemakers have implemented\n\nThe established quality trends will continue in 2024 and will define the market: there is growing professionalism in the world of wine, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning, and Europe will remain a focal area of global wine consumption. The consequence of this is that the virtues the *Hawesko Group* has carefully nurtured over many decades are more important than ever as a unique selling proposition in the marketplace.

Slight growth in the restaurant trade is planned, whereas sales to food and specialist retailers will be stable or slightly down, though much will depend on the state of the economy. In the case of food retailers in particular, consumers are expected to be highly sensitive to price and it will be necessary to adjust the product range accordingly. With suppliers also recognising the need to do this, the first winemakers have already indicated their readiness to drop product prices in order to restore the price-demand function. There is also the prospect of growth for spirits by bringing new suppliers of known brand products on board. The segment's profitability should be able to improve slightly once more after a weak 2023, producing mild growth in operating EBIT.\n\nThe e-commerce segment will again serve as the clearest bellwether of consumer confidence. With logistics costs still rising, the e-commerce units are dependent on larger shopping baskets and increased trading margins. After two years of declining sales and operating EBIT, a turnaround is expected in 2024. We therefore anticipate that sales for the segment will not fall below the level of 2023 and will remain steady year on year. But to what extent the segment can achieve any stronger sales boost is very dependent on consumer sentiment.

The range of top-class wines, knowledgeable handling of the product wine, experience in specialised warehousing and shipping logistics as well as the ability to keep enthusing customers with high service commitment and quality are key to the group brands' high recognition value in the wine market.\n\n#### *Anticipated financial performance*\n\n**62**\n\nFollowing on from a challenging financial year, the Board of Management again anticipates little economic tailwind in 2024. According to its internal estimates, high (core) inflation, which is eating into real disposable incomes, as well as low consumer confidence will again dominate the market environment in which the *Hawesko Group* operates.\n\nThe Retail segment is expected to achieve slight growth in sales revenues. Perceived as a business that trades in everyday consumer goods and with smaller shopping baskets than e-commerce, this is the area affected least by consumer holdback. *Jacques'* is also planning to open further outlets and expects the newly opened stores in 2023 to stimulate growth. *WEIN & CO* is expected to achieve a substantially improved operating EBIT that will also benefit operating EBIT for the segment.\n\nThe B2B segment will face a challenging 2024 with sales on a par with the previous year. Slight growth in the restaurant trade is planned, whereas sales to food and specialist retailers will be stable or slightly down, though much will depend on the state of the economy.

Other opportunities will open up for the segment with the creation of additional marketplace platforms at *Hawesko* and *WirWinzer*. However increased road tolls and other legislative changes will keep up the pressure on freight and logistics costs. The steadily rising fulfilment costs in this segment necessitate lasting structural changes to the cost structure of the e-commerce units; these will be made in 2024. We expect the impact on EBIT in 2024 to reach around € 1 to € 2 million. However disregarding this effect, operating EBIT for the segment will increase marginally.\n\nOverall, the Board of Management expects a slight rise in sales of up to +2 percent and operating EBIT in the range of € 36 to € 40 million. There will be non-recurring effects requiring adjustment in the amount of up to € 2 million for further restructuring costs in the B2B and e-commerce segments; reported EBIT could therefore be up to € 2 million lower than operating EBIT.\n\nThe Board of Management anticipates free cash flow in the range of € 16 to € 22 million for 2024, with an operating ROCE of 14 to 16 percent.\n\nThe Board of Management will announce its assessments and expectations based on the latest developments in the customary manner in the quarterly reports and interim report.\n\n#### *Anticipated financial position*\n\nThe capital expenditure made in 2022 and 2023 on expanding the logistics centre and the two acquisitions in the B2B segment resulted in a substantial rise in borrowings in 2023. This increased indebtedness and an elevated interest level mean the *Hawesko Group* will continue to face higher interest charges in 2024. It therefore plans to reduce indebtedness in 2024 and in particular to reduce the average tied-up capital and the associated interest costs. It also aims to minimise above all the inventory levels in 2024 as a means of generating extra cash flow to clear debt.\n\nAlongside this, ongoing cash flow will be used for essential capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and for dividend payments. The current plans do not envisage substantial longterm investments or acquisitions.\n\n#### *Overall statement on the anticipated development of the group*\n\nIn light of the individual factors outlined and its assessment of how the wine market will develop, the Board of Management considers a steady upward development in the *Hawesko Group* to be achievable. It continues to attach high priority to sales growth. The Board of Management also wants growth to be profitable. Consistently exceeding a return on capital employed (operating ROCE) of 14.0 percent remains an important benchmark.\n\n#### **OPPORTUNITIES REPORT**\n\nOpportunities mean potential positive departures from the expected economic environment and the economic situation of the *Hawesko Group* as outlined in the report on expected developments.

Depending on what specific form any restrictions on advertising were to take, an advertising ban could nevertheless have a significant negative impact on the business operations of the Hawesko Group because particularly the e-commerce business model generates sales through regular advertising campaigns. Based on its market position and product range, the Board of Management considers that the group would barely be affected by a public debate aimed at encouraging consumption of alcohol only in moderation.

The directive affects predominantly online retailers (e.g. right of objection) and bricks-and-mortar retailers (obligation to inform). The Hawesko Group companies affected implemented it swiftly and respond swiftly to any instructions or cautions.\n\nThe risk from the public debate on alcohol and advertising bans or restrictions is classified as an A risk, with a high probability.\n\n#### *Inflation and dependence on economic cycle*\n\nEconomic development in Europe and Germany is dominated by the fallout from the war in Ukraine. It has driven up prices for such commodities as energy, fuels and food, resulting in inflation well above the levels of recent years. The Hawesko Group companies are also affected and the risk of inflation therefore continues to be considered a category A risk.\n\nHand in hand with the inflation risk and its causes as described above, based on the current assessment the risk of dependence on the economic cycle is also stated separately as a category A risk. Macroeconomic fortunes exercise considerable influence over the propensity of the population to consume and therefore over the business development of the Hawesko Group. Rising consumer prices due to inflation, at a faster rate than any pay settlements, means consumption is bound to decline due to a loss of real income.\n\nThe risk of sustained high inflation and general dependence on the economic cycle is rated as an A risk with a very high probability.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Growing competition*\n\nThe wine markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland exhibit growing competition. New market participants are entering the market and attempting to capture market shares as swiftly as possible. As such market participants do not have a customer base that has been built up over decades, nor a level of specialist expertise comparable to that of the *Hawesko Group*, they try to gain market shares through price. They succeed in this to some extent by using special offers and discounts, with the result that the high price transparency of online offers can increase the pressure on prices and margins for all market participants and erode profitability. Although this approach does not fundamentally threaten the business models of the *Hawesko Group* with their focus on expertise, service and sustained growth, it hinders the acquisition of new customers and inflates the cost of this process. The effects of more intense competition are built into the plans and risk assessments of the *Hawesko Group* entities but for a variety of reasons are not fully foreseeable. The *Hawesko Group* attempts to cushion these effects by offering an extensive product range expertly and by striving not to be dependent on individual wines or producers. Furthermore, the group subsidiaries endeavour to include unique products and specially bottled wines in their range to avoid direct comparison.\n\nThe risk from growing competition is classified as an A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Dependence on Deutsche Post/DHL*\n\nBoth for sending out advertising and customer communications and for the shipping and delivery of consignments to our end customers, Deutsche Post/DHL is a fundamental service provider for which there is no adequate substitute. The risk of dependence on Deutsche Post/DHL – especially in the event of delays, poor performance and price increases – is therefore reported as a category A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Failure of IT hardware and software*\n\nThe steadily growing share of transactions handled online, specifically in the distance-selling area, also increases awareness of the availability of the web shops operated by the *Hawesko Group*. Equally, all key business processes of necessity rely on the IT infrastructure and are dependent on its proper functioning. A failure, especially if it were for an extended period, would result in significant sales losses and have direct economic consequences. The issue of IT security and availability, especially bearing cyber crime in mind, is closely managed and updated swiftly to reflect new threat scenarios.\n\nThe risk from the failure of IT hardware and software is classified as an A risk with a high probability.\n\n#### *Wine as a natural product: marketability and fitness for consumption, quality, possible negative effects*\n\nWine is a product of nature which accordingly exhibits variations in quality from year to year, and also depending on variety and location, under the influence of the weather, the individual locations and the fermenting processes. This variation affects prices and influences demand for individual products. On the strength of its many years of experience in the wine market, the *Hawesko Group* is able to limit the impact of these risks, but it can never exclude them entirely.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* is not dependent on specific suppliers.

High-price and premium products such as those sold by the *Hawesko Group* are no exception. While late delivery for B2B customers (resellers and restaurant trade) and to our shops may lead to lost sales, a failure to deliver goods ordered by end customers in time for a particular occasion, for example, can spoil their enjoyment of the product. Customers will remember what they perceive as late delivery or unavailable products as a negative service experience and this may prompt specifically new customers to switch suppliers. The *Hawesko Group* is therefore eager to implement intelligent purchasing management to keep as many products as possible available immediately. Alongside this, it works solely with reputable partner enterprises on the logistics side. All logistics processes focus on keeping goods traffic as efficient as possible and are constantly being refined to create demand-led logistics. Delays in delivery due to extreme weather are difficult to foresee.\n\nThe risks from the logistics area are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\n#### *Financial risks*\n\nThere exist a number of financial risks within the *Hawesko Group*. These include above all influences of exchange rate and interest rate movements, as well as the non-payment and liquidity risk. Risks from the use of financial instruments are not material for the *Hawesko Group*.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the *Hawesko Group* are importers of wines traded internationally, and as such are to a limited extent affected by exchange rate movements outside the eurozone. However imports are overwhelmingly from within the eurozone.\n\nTo a minor extent the refinancing of the *Hawesko Group's* working capital requirements is in the form of loans which are taken out at current interest rates. Dependence on interest rate movements is thus low. As part of centrally controlled liquidity management, it is endeavoured to keep sufficient funds available to the *Hawesko Group* for ongoing business and for capital expenditure. The risks from receivables are limited by credit checks and credit management systems.\n\nThe risks from the financial area are classified as a B risk with a medium probability.\n\n#### *Personnel risks*\n\nIn many areas of the *Hawesko Group*, attracting and holding onto employees with specialist expertise is an elementary factor of long-term successful entrepreneurial development.

Personnel risks exist especially if it is not possible to find sufficient numbers of specialists in the medium to long term due to demographic and technological change.

The shares already held by\n\nHawesko Holding SE are included in the measurement of cost at fair value. Gains or losses arising from such a remeasurement are recognised through profit or loss. Transactions that do not lead to a loss of control are recognised through other comprehensive income as equity transactions for non-controlling interests. If put options are granted in the course of business combinations, an analysis is performed on a case-by-case basis whether the opportunities and risks pass to the Hawesko Group or remain with the minority interest.

The shares already held by Hawesko Holding SE are included in the measurement of cost at fair value. Gains or losses arising from such a remeasurement are recognised through profit or loss. Transactions that do not lead to a loss of control are recognised through other comprehensive income as equity transactions for non-controlling interests. If put options are granted in the course of business combinations, an analysis is performed on a case-by-case basis whether the opportunities and risks pass to the Hawesko Group or remain with the minority interest. In the case of fair value options it is fundamentally assumed that the opportunities and risks remain with the minority interest. In that case minority interest shares are reported separately. Subsequent measurement of the put options is through profit or loss and is recognised in the other financial result.\n\nAn NCI forward was agreed with the minority interest in Vinos in the previous year. The opportunities and risks from these non-controlling interests have passed to the *Hawesko Group* with the result that the shares have been shown as acquired since the previous year and minority-interest shares in Vinos were no longer reported.\n\nAt the time of loss of control, all residual interests are remeasured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nJoint ventures are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 11. That standard makes a distinction within joint arrangements between a joint operation and a joint venture, depending on the contractual rights and obligations. According to IFRS 11 and IAS 28, joint ventures are accounted for at acquisition cost upon addition and subsequently using the equity method at the updated pro rata value of the equity capital of the investment.\n\nIntra-group sales, charges and earnings as well as accounts receivable and payable between the consolidated companies are eliminated.\n\nIntercompany results for inventories are eliminated unless they are of more than minor economic significance.\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the pro rata fair value of the acquired assets or debts assumed. Following initial recognition, pro rata gains and losses are allocated without limit, as a result of which non-controlling interests may also show a negative balance.\n\nThe items contained in the consolidated financial statements for all group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each business is active (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, which is the functional and reporting currency of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses from the processing of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at year-end rates are\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised if the asset is disposed of or no further economic benefit is to be expected from its use or disposal.

Taking the sales and management structure as the starting point, a cash-generating unit is defined as an individual company or a group. The impairment test is to be performed at the balance sheet date and then subsequently whenever there is evidence of impairment. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is fundamentally determined on the basis of the fair value less disposal costs. The fair value is calculated on the basis of future cash flows according to group planning. Discounting of the forecast cash flows is performed using a risk-adjusted interest rate. Capital market data is used in determining the risk-oriented interest rate. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the allocable goodwill is to be impaired by the difference.

If the impairment exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill, the excess amount is to be distributed pro rata among the other assets of the cash-generating unit.\n\n#### *Property, Plant & Equipment*\n\n*Property, plant and equipment* is carried at acquisition or manufacturing cost less depreciation by the straight-line method, as well as impairment where applicable. The depreciation period reflects the prospective economic useful life of the assets. In the year of acquisition property, plant and equipment is depreciated pro rata temporis. The residual carrying amounts, the useful lives and the depreciation methods for the assets are tested at least on every reporting date; if the expectations deviate from the previous estimates, the corresponding changes are recognised as changes in estimates according to IAS 8.\n\nThe acquisition or manufacturing cost includes the purchase price and directly allocable costs of bringing the asset to the location and into the required condition intended by the management, and also the estimated costs of dismantling and clearing the object and the re-establishment of the location where it is situated. If an item of property, plant and equipment comprises several components with different useful lives, the individual material components are depreciated over their individual useful lives.

The *Hawesko Group* allocates the transaction price to these components based on their relative individual order prices. Land that *Hawesko Holding SE* rents as the lessee is an exception. In such cases the group exercises the option not to distinguish between lease and non-lease components, and instead to account for the entire contract as a lease agreement.\n\nRental terms are negotiated on an individual basis and comprise a wide range of different terms.

As soon as reasonable assurance then exists, an other financial asset is recognised for outstanding grants and the carrying amounts of the sundry debt and subsidised property, plant and equipment are adjusted in line with actual construction progress. All grants received are recognised within cash flow from investing activities. In the financial year, investment grants for € 35 thousand were recognised under property, plant and equipment.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised if the asset is disposed of or no further economic benefit is to be expected from its use or disposal. The profit or loss from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the object and is recognised under other operating income or other operating expenses at the time of derecognition.\n\nThe depreciation plan for property, plant and equipment is based on the following estimates of useful life:\n\n| USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT     | Years  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Buildings                                        | 3 – 25 |\n| Technincal equipment and machinery               | 3 – 18 |\n| Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment | 3 – 20 |\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated either over their respective useful life or over the term of any lease, if shorter.\n\n#### *Shares in investments accounted for using the equity method*\n\nThe shares of the group in investments accounted for using the equity method comprise shares in one joint venture.\n\nA joint venture is an agreement through which the group exercises joint control; in this case it holds rights to the net assets of the agreement instead of rights to its assets and obligations for its debts.\n\nShares in the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, including transaction costs. After first-time recognition, the consolidated financial statements contain the group's share in the comprehensive income of the investments accounted for using the equity method until such time as significant influence or joint control ends.\n\n#### *Borrowing Costs*\n\nBorrowing costs that can be allocated directly to the acquisition, construction or manufacturing of a qualifying asset are capitalised as a component of acquisition or manufacturing cost. The *Hawesko Group* definition of qualifying assets or other assets is those where at least twelve months are needed to bring them into their intended usable or saleable condition. Borrowing costs for assets that are measured at fair value and for inventories that are regularly created or manufactured in large quantities are not capitalised. In recent years there were no qualifying assets, as a result of which no borrowing costs were capitalised. Based on the principle of materiality, borrowing costs are not capitalised this year.\n\n**103**\n\n*Leases*\n\nclude extension options.\n\nprovision\n\nthat extension options will be used.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Leases*\n\n**103**\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nreceived are recognised and a non-financial sundry debt in the same amount recognised as a liability.

The profit or loss from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the object and is recognised under other operating income or other operating expenses at the time of derecognition.\n\nThe depreciation plan for property, plant and equipment is based on the following estimates of useful life:\n\n**USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT** Years Buildings 3 – 25 Technincal equipment and machinery 3 – 18 Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 – 20\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated either over their respective useful life or over the term of any lease,\n\nThe shares of the group in investments accounted for using the equity method comprise shares in one joint\n\nA joint venture is an agreement through which the group exercises joint control; in this case it holds rights to\n\nShares in the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.

The *Hawesko Group* definition of qualifying assets or other assets is those where at least twelve months are needed to bring them into their intended usable or saleable condition. Borrowing costs for assets that are measured at fair value and for inventories that are regularly created or manufactured in large quantities are not capitalised. In recent years there were no qualifying assets, as a result of which no borrowing costs were capitalised.

Tenancy agreements are generally concluded for fixed periods of between three and ten years, but may include extension options.\n\nContracts may include both lease and non-lease components. The *Hawesko Group* allocates the transaction price to these components based on their relative individual order prices. Land that *Hawesko Holding SE* rents as the lessee is an exception. In such cases the group exercises the option not to distinguish between lease and non-lease components, and instead to account for the entire contract as a lease agreement.\n\nRental terms are negotiated on an individual basis and comprise a wide range of different terms. The lease agreements do not contain credit terms except where the leased items serve as collateral for the lessor. Leased assets may therefore not be used additionally as collateral for securing loans.\n\nSince 1 January 2019 *leases* have been recognised as a right of use and a corresponding lease liability from the point in time when the leased object is available for use by the group.\n\nAssets and debts from leases are recognised at present values upon first-time recognition. The lease liabilities comprise the present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- Fixed payments less any lease incentives to be received\n- Variable lease payments that are linked to an index, initially measured with the index at the date of provision\n- Expected payments by the group from drawing on residual value guarantees\n- The exercise price of a put option, the exercising of which by the group is sufficiently certain\n\nThe measurement of the lease liability also takes account of lease payments where it is sufficiently certain that extension options will be used.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the implicit underlying interest rate for the lease, provided this can be readily determined. Otherwise – as is the norm in the group – it is discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee. This corresponds to the interest rate that the lessee in question would need to pay if it needed to raise funds in order to acquire an asset of comparable value for a comparable period, with comparable collateral and on comparable terms in a comparable economic environment.\n\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the *Hawesko Group* starts with a risk-free interest rate and adjusts it for the credit risk of the lessee. Further adjustments in addition concern the term of the lease, the economic environment and the term of the lease agreement.\n\nThe *Hawesko Group* is exposed to possible future rises in variable lease payments that could result from a change in an index or interest rate. These possible changes in lease instalments are not reflected in the lease\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImpairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount.

Lease agreements with a term of up to twelve months are considered shortterm leases. Low-value assets are all leases with a new value of less than € 5 thousand.\n\nVarious real estate lease agreements of the *Hawesko Group* contain extension and termination options. Such contractual terms are used to obtain maximum operational flexibility from the assets in use. The majority of the existing extension and termination options can be exercised only by the *Hawesko Group*, and not by the respective lessor.\n\nIn determining the term of leases, the management considers all facts and circumstances that offer an economic incentive to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options.

The net realisable value is determined as the estimated sales proceeds in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs required for disposal.

Under this approach, the expected credit losses over time are to be recognised from the point of first-time recognition of the receivables. In determining whether the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recording and in estimating expected credit losses, the group uses appropriate, reliable information that is relevant and available at no undue time and cost. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analyses that are based on past experience of the group and well-founded assessments, including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is overdue by more than 90 days. If there is a significant increase in the non-payment risk at the balance sheet date and the creditworthiness of a financial asset is also considered to be compromised, in other words if there are further objective indications of impairment, the specific risk provisioning is measured on the basis of the present value of the expected\n\n• it is unlikely that the debtor can discharge its credit obligation towards the group in full without the\n\nThe combined effect of several events may possibly compromise the creditworthiness of financial assets or\n\nThe *financial assets* include primarily cash in banking accounts and cash on hand, trade receivables as well\n\nIf the *Hawesko Group* has fulfilled its contractual obligations, a contract asset or a receivable is recognised. Receivables are recognised if the entitlement to receive consideration is no longer subject to any conditions. This normally occurs if the group is contractually entitled to invoice the customer. For trade customers, a receivable is normally recognised upon shipping of the goods because at that point the entitlement to consideration is unconditional. In other words, payment is due automatically from that point on, with the passage of time.

Transaction costs of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as expense through profit or loss.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments is dependent on the business model of the *Hawesko Group* for the management of the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset. For this purpose debt instruments are classified using three measurement categories:\n\n| AC:    | Assets that are held for the collection of the contractual cash flows, where these<br>cash flows represent exclusively interest and principal repayments, are measured at<br>amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is reported under finan<br>cial income using the effective interest method.

The impairment method depends on whether a significant increase in the credit risk exists.

Under this approach, the expected credit losses over time are to be recognised from the point of first-time recognition of the receivables. In determining whether the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recording and in estimating expected credit losses, the group uses appropriate, reliable information that is relevant and available at no undue time and cost. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analyses that are based on past experience of the group and well-founded assessments, including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the non-payment risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is overdue by more than 90 days. If there is a significant increase in the non-payment risk at the balance sheet date and the creditworthiness of a financial asset is also considered to be compromised, in other words if there are further objective indications of impairment, the specific risk provisioning is measured on the basis of the present value of the expected losses over the remaining life of the financial asset.\n\nThe group treats the creditworthiness of a financial asset as compromised if\n\n- it is unlikely that the debtor can discharge its credit obligation towards the group in full without the group needing recourse to measures such as realising collateral, or\n- the financial asset is overdue by more than 365 days, or\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nUpon initial recognition the *Hawesko Group* measures a financial asset at fair value and – in the event of a financial asset subsequently not measured at fair value through profit or loss – the transaction costs arising directly on the acquisition of that asset.

Receivables are recognised if the entitlement to receive consideration is no longer subject to any conditions. This normally occurs if the group is contractually entitled to invoice the customer. For trade customers, a receivable is normally recognised upon shipping of the goods because at that point the entitlement to consideration is unconditional. In other words, payment is due automatically from that point on, with the passage of time. For private customers, the receivable is recognised upon successful acceptance of the goods by the customer or upon fulfilment of the shipping terms in the contract of sale.\n\n*Trade receivables* are in respect of amounts owed by customers for the goods sold in the normal course of business. These are classified entirely as current, in a reflection of their payment deadlines.

In view of the fluctuating market and economic situation, the underlying assumptions may depart from the actual development\n\nProvisions for reconversion obligations for installations in the catering outlets and for returning the leased asset to the condition required in the lease agreement are recognised in the amount of the present value of the estimated future obligations. A corresponding amount in reconversion obligations is capitalised as a component of the cost of leasehold improvements and rights of use.

The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the fair value less disposal costs for the cash-generating unit. Cash-generating units normally represent individual subsidiaries within the group. Determining the fair value in particular requires estimates of the future cash flow based on group planning. The most important assumptions on which the calculation of fair value is based comprise the discount rate, the net cash flows and the sustainable growth rate.\n\nMany leases held by the *Hawesko Group* contain extension and termination options. Responsibility for negotiating and designing leases rests with the local companies, and for that reason lease agreements exhibit a variety of contractual conditions. This gives the management of each company the necessary operational flexibility to manage its business, in other words manage the underlying lease assets, as well as the scope to respond to changing business requirements.\n\nThe majority of leases within the group consist of contracts for rental of land, office properties and retail shops. Most of these are situated in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe term of these leases largely determines the level of the lease liabilities.\n\nMost leases for retail shops feature a non-cancellable basic rental period of three to five years, which may often be extended several times in each case by between three and five years. After the expiry of the noncancellable basic rental period the lease rolls over automatically normally by a further twelve months if neither party terminates the lease or if the *Hawesko Group* exercises one of its extension options as the lessee.\n\nIn determining the term of the lease, all facts and circumstances that represent an economic incentive for the *Hawesko Group* to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option are assessed and taken into consideration. Extension options (or periods covered by termination options) are only considered a component of the term of a lease if the *Hawesko Group* is reasonably certain that it will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. Under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, exercise is considered \"reasonably certain\" if it is less than \"virtually certain\" and more certain than \"more likely than not\".\n\nAfter the start of use, the probability of exercising an option should only be reassessed if there is a significant event or significant change in the circumstances with an effect on the original assessment and those events or changes are under the control of the lessee. The *Hawesko Group* reassesses the term of a lease if an option is exercised or not exercised or if the group is under an obligation to exercise or not exercise an option.\n\nDetermination of the incremental borrowing rate to safeguard the lease liability is performed quarterly by the Corporate Finance department. The incremental borrowing rate represents the group-specific interest rate for the raising of funds with a similar maturity in order to finance the asset in question.\n\nThe measurement of inventory risks within inventories depends substantially on the assessment of future demand and of the time for which stocks of goods are held as a result, and in the case of especially high-price wine segments (primarily Grands Crus) the estimate of future market price development. For high-price wines, this estimate is made based on market price observations and on discussions with market participants (in particular the French wine commercial brokers, or courtiers).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe management creates allowances for receivables to account for expected losses resulting from customers' inability to pay.

In particular due to cyclical effects, this company has not recovered adequately from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which to some extent also affected the attached specialist retail outlets due to closures in the restaurant trade. The cross-sector downturn in consumption in e-commerce observed in the third quarter equally had an adverse effect on earnings at *Wein & Co.* We attribute the fall in e-commerce sales to continuing high inflation and generally subdued consumer confidence against a backdrop of wars and conflicts. Compounded by the pressure of costs, the planned turnaround at *Wein & Co.* was not accomplished and the company ended the financial year with a loss of € 2.5 million. We also expect the turnaround to come more slowly than planned over the next few years; for that reason the goodwill of *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million was written off in full in the third quarter. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, which after impairment corresponds to the net realisable value, is therefore € 20.8 million. According to our plans, the sales of *Wein & Co.* will rise annually by between just under 5% and 5.5% over the next four years. The plans envisage a continuing drive to reduce costs. Customer acquisition and retention costs will require an average of € 2.3 million in the years of the planning period. Planned capital expenditure, disregarding IFRS 16 capital expenditure, will be in the range of € 0.5 and € 0.9 million per year. Overall, our plans envisage a gross profit margin of 48% per year for assessing the recoverability of goodwill. If unforeseeable events result\n\nin higher costs or lower proceeds, the impairment of further assets could potentially be required.\n\nNo conceivable changes to the key parameters would lead to goodwill impairment.\n\nDespite the general decline in consumption compared with the previous year, in the other cash-generating units there are no indications of goodwill impairment because their annual results remain positive and they\n\nwere included in the tests.\n\naccording to IFRS 16 was also taken into account.\n\nwill prospectively remain profitable.\n\n**136**\n\n#### **18 RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL**\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the goodwill tested and the assumptions made in the individual impairment tests, in each case for the smallest cash-generating unit (CGU):\n\n| NAME OF CGU                                                                                | Vinos      | Wein & Co. | Wein Wolf<br>Gruppe | WirWinzer  | Global Wines<br>& Spirits | Miscellane<br>ous  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Segment                                                                                    | E-Commerce | Retail     | B2B                 | E-Commerce | B2B                       | B2B and re<br>tail |\n| Carrying amount goodwill<br>31/12/2023                                                     | 8.711      | 0          | 4.455               | 2.686      | 7.114                     | 2.877              |\n| Impairment                                                                                 | 0          | 8.197      | 0                   | 0          | 0                         | 0                  |\n| Duration of planning pe<br>riod (as previous year)                                         | 3 years    | 4 years    | 3 years             | 3 years    | 3 years                   | 3 years            |\n| Sustainable growth rate<br>per year after end of plan<br>ning period (as previous<br>year) | 0,75%      | 0,75%      | 0,75%               | 0,75%      | 0,75%                     | 0,75%              |\n| Discount rate (after-tax in<br>terest rate) 2023                                           | 7,94%      | 8,56%      | 7,94%               | 7,94%      | 8,97%                     | 7,94%              |\n| Discount rate (after-tax in<br>terest rate) 2022                                           | 7,32%      | 7,32%      | 7,32%               | 7,32%      | 8,69%                     | 7,32%              |\n\n#### **IMPAIRMENT TEST**\n\nFor purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) based on the future discounted cash flows. The measurement is treated as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because of the non-observable inputs applied in measurement. The management approach and the key assumptions in determining the FVLCOD and VIU (applied to *Global Wines & Spirits* in previous year) for the cash-generating unit are based essentially on the future cash flows anticipated in group planning over the next three or four years, depending on company, and are discounted at the balance sheet date. The key parameters here are the discount rate, the net cash flows (sales performance, customer acquisition and retention costs, investments, margins) and the sustainable growth rate. Rising net cash flows are fundamentally assumed over the detailed planning period.\n\nIn the planning period, the assumptions used for the impairment tests are based on approved corporate planning (at the level of the individual enterprises) and on externally published sources. To some extent risk markdowns have been applied for company-specific market share developments. The margins used are based on past experience and future expectations, and have been updated based on cost-cutting measures implemented. Investment ratios are based on past experience and for the planning period take account of replacement purchases envisaged for production facilities. The costs of the corporate functions were allocated to the\n\n**135**\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nindividual units according to the user-pays principle.

In particular due to cyclical effects, this company has not recovered adequately from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which to some extent also affected the attached specialist retail outlets due to closures in the restaurant trade. The cross-sector downturn in consumption in e-commerce observed in the third quarter equally had an adverse effect on earnings at *Wein & Co.* We attribute the fall in e-commerce sales to continuing high inflation and generally subdued consumer confidence against a backdrop of wars and conflicts. Compounded by the pressure of costs, the planned turnaround at *Wein & Co.* was not accomplished and the company ended the financial year with a loss of € 2.5 million. We also expect the turnaround to come more slowly than planned over the next few years; for that reason the goodwill of *Wein & Co.* in the amount of € 8.2 million was written off in full in the third quarter. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, which after impairment corresponds to the net realisable value, is therefore € 20.8 million. According to our plans, the sales of *Wein & Co.* will rise annually by between just under 5% and 5.5% over the next four years. The plans envisage a continuing drive to reduce costs. Customer acquisition and retention costs will require an average of € 2.3 million in the years of the planning period. Planned capital expenditure, disregarding IFRS 16 capital expenditure, will be in the range of € 0.5 and € 0.9 million per year. Overall, our plans envisage a gross profit margin of 48% per year for assessing the recoverability of goodwill. If unforeseeable events result in higher costs or lower proceeds, the impairment of further assets could potentially be required.\n\nDespite the general decline in consumption compared with the previous year, in the other cash-generating units there are no indications of goodwill impairment because their annual results remain positive and they will prospectively remain profitable.\n\nNo conceivable changes to the key parameters would lead to goodwill impairment.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Other fixtures and**  **Advance** \n\n**payments** \n\n**and

For the determination of impairment, customer groups were divided up by business model and anticipated creditworthiness. B2C receivables from consumers/end customers exist primarily in the e-commerce and Retail segments. B2B receivables are from trade customers, above all in the restaurant, hotel and specialist retail trade. For sales to food retailers, the various different customers are often billed centrally via settling agents. To reflect creditworthiness and the payment structure, the latter and the supplier receivables are measured separately. Because of the highly heterogeneous customer and supplier structure, there is no high dependence on any single economic partner. The group is therefore not exposed to any notable concentration risk.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor certain trade receivables, specifically in the B2B segment, the *Hawesko Group* takes out bad debt insurance to which it can have recourse in the event of non-payment by the counterparty in accordance with the contractual arrangements.\n\nFor certain customer transactions the *Hawesko Group* uses factoring of receivables from customers. This exclusively takes the form of genuine factoring where the risk passes to the factor. The total volume in 2023 was around € € 7.6 million. At 31 December 2023 there were outstanding receivables of € 70 thousand where factoring was used.\n\nThere are also receivables from payment service providers in the amount of € 5,180 thousand (previous year: € 4,787 thousand). Based on experience and the expected future development, the need for impairment is assessed as insignificant. No impairment is therefore applied.\n\nIn determining expected credit losses, both allowances for expected credit losses and specific risk provisioning amounting to € 442 thousand (previous year: € 320 thousand) were applied for receivables with a compromised credit standing.\n\nThe expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles for sales over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2023 and the corresponding historical defaults in that period. The historical loss ratios are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on the macroeconomic factors that govern customers' ability to settle the receivables.\n\nIn respect of the trade receivables that were not yet overdue, there is no evidence at the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment commitments. No impairment is applied to these receivables because they are assessed as insignificant. There was no renegotiation with debtors on the extending of payment deadlines.\n\nThe impairment on trade receivables developed as follows:\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nOverdue by more than 365\n\ndays **Total**\n\nOverdue by more than 90 days\n\nThe following table shows the maturity structure of trade receivables at the 2022 reporting date:\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,5% 54,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,2% 50,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,05% 10,0% 100%\n\nDefault rate (%, calculated from net values) 0,1% 15,0% 15,0%\n\nNot overdue or overdue by 1 to 90 days\n\nsand 5.892 86 154 6.132 Expected loss in € thousand -24 -71 -121 -216\n\nsand 9.009 78 80 9.167 Expected loss in € thousand -12 -46 -72 -130\n\nsand 21.432 30 48 21.510 Expected loss in € thousand -9 -3 -40 -52\n\nsand 7.939 68 49 8.056 Expected loss in € thousand -7 -9 -6 -22 **TOTAL RECEIVABLES OF GROUP 44.272 262 331 44.865 TOTAL EXPECTED DEFAULTS -52 -129 -239 -420**\n\nThe simplified impairment model is applied based on past data.

The impairment of the long-term loan is treated as an expected credit loss and posted as such in the statement of income.\n\nIn view of the short-term nature of the other receivables, their carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. Within the long-term receivables, the fair values equally do not differ significantly from the carrying amounts. The fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost used for reconciliation purposes is determined by discounting based on a market rate that is appropriate for the risk and with a matching maturity.\n\nThe loans and purchase price deferrals at 31 December 2023 essentially comprise the receivable from the purchase price payment from the sale of the shares in the company *Ziegler*, which has not yet accrued at the balance sheet date and according to plan will accrue in 2027.\n\nIn the previous year the financial assets held as investments particularly included other investments taken out for liquidity management purposes.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OTHER NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nAt the balance sheet date there are other non-financial assets amounting to € 10,525 thousand (previous year: € 5,174 thousand) mainly in respect of deferred costs and advance payments, and measured at amortised cost.\n\n#### **NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n*NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables are shown in the operating result as impairment losses.

The aim of its financial risk management is to limit these market risks by finance-oriented activities. Selected derivative hedges are also used for this purpose. As a fundamental principle, however, protection is only obtained for those risks that affect the group's cash flow.\n\nRisk management for the *Hawesko Group* is governed in the first instance by a corporate finance department (Group Finance) based on guidelines that the management has approved. The Group Finance department identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the operating companies of the *Hawesko Group*. The Board of Management provides written principles for overall risk management as well as principles for certain areas, such as foreign currency, interest rate and default risks, as well as the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the handling of liquidity surpluses.\n\nIf all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is adopted to eliminate the mismatch in financial reporting between the hedge and the hedged underlying transaction. For interest rate risks, this results in the recognition of interest expense at a fixed rate for the hedged variable-rate loans, and for exchange risks it results in sales revenues that are realised at the hedged exchange rate.\n\n#### *DERIVATIVES AND HEDGES*\n\nDerivatives are used exclusively for economic hedging purposes, not as speculative investments. However if derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, they are classified as and recognised at fair value through profit or loss.

To assure this and in order to continue paying a dividend in keeping with the earnings per share, it is necessary to continue generating an adequate free cash flow. The sustained optimisation of working capital is a priority target.\n\nThe capital structure is managed on the basis of the net debt or net liquidity position. This is defined as the sum of amounts due to banks, other loans, lease liabilities and provisions for pensions, less cash. At 31 December 2023 there is net debt of € 170,020 thousand (previous year: net debt of € 126,279 thousand).\n\nThe operating return on capital employed (operating ROCE) is a further important indicator for capital management.

A long-term operating return on capital employed (ROCE) of consistently at least 14.0 percent is the aim. An operating rate of return of 12.4 percent was achieved in the year under review (previous year: 15.4 percent).\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **45 APPLICATION OF THE EXEMPTION RULES OF SECTION 264 (3) OF GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE FOR INCORPORATED FIRMS**\n\nThe group companies IWL Internationale Wein-Logistik GmbH, WirWinzer GmbH, WineCom International Holding GmbH, WineTech Commerce GmbH, Hanseatisches Wein- und Sekt-Kontor HAWESKO GmbH, Jacques' Wein-Depot Wein-Einzelhandel GmbH, Wein & Vinos GmbH, Wein Service Bonn GmbH, Tesdorpf GmbH, The Wine Company Hawesko GmbH, Weinland Ariane Abayan GmbH, Wein Wolf GmbH, Grand Cru Select Distributionsgesellschaft mbH and Global Eastern Wine Holding GmbH make use of the exemption rules of Section 264 (3) of German Commercial Code for the year under review.

We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with those requirements. In addition, we declare that, pursuant to Article 10 (2) letter f) of EU Audit Regulation we did not perform any prohibited non-audit services within the meaning of Article 5 (1) of EU Audit Regulation.

If intrayear impairment triggers occur, an ad hoc impairment test is also carried out intrayear. The smallest cash-generating units normally represent individual subsidiaries within the group. Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount of the smallest cash-generating unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, impairment is required. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less disposal costs or value in use of the company. The relevant date for impairment testing is 31 December 2023.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nTesting goodwill for impairment is a complex process and is based on a number of discretionary assumptions.

The war against Ukraine, risen costs for energy and continuing high inflation unsettled consumers and were a barrier to consumer confidence improving across all sectors. The *Hawesko Group* felt the generally prevailing sentiment among consumers, especially in the e-commerce segment. There has so far been no sign of the hoped-for recovery that would lead to increased online activity among our customers. The positive development of the Retail and B2B segments is therefore all the more welcome. Our Retail format *Jacques'* has attracted many lovers of wine with its approachable wine-tasting concept. In B2B business, sales to the hotel and restaurant trades generated a steady stream of demand. On the whole the *Hawesko* Group was able to assert its leading position in the intensely competitive German wine market. Sales of € 660.3 million for financial year 2023 were consequently only slightly down on the previous year's level. Amid still-challenging market conditions, at the start of 2023 the *Hawesko Group* embarked on a programme of consistent cost-cutting measures across all segments to permanently boost its earnings performance. Together with an improvement in gross profit that was also achieved through appropriate price increases, it therefore proved possible to stabilise the operating result at € 34.0 million.\n\nEven this unusual environment, the *Hawesko Group* was still able to demonstrate the strategic strength of its business model and navigated a successful course through the various risks and opportunities. The Supervisory Board believes that the group continues to be in robust health and remains confident about the medium and long-term outlook for business development.\n\n#### **INTERACTION BETWEEN BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY BOARD**\n\nThroughout the 2023 financial year the Supervisory Board performed its statutory duties conscientiously and with great care. It was informed of the situation of the company at regular meetings and in committee meetings, advised the Board of Management on key strategic matters, oversaw it throughout and took all the necessary decisions. In addition to providing regular reports, pursuant to Section 90 (1) third sentence of the German Stock Corporation Act the Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board Chair of other important matters. The reports contained the overall position of the group and current business developments as well as its medium-term strategy with investment, financial and earnings plans, in addition to the development of management. Priority topics for discussion were the economic development of the group companies and the future direction of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\nAt four ordinary meetings in financial year 2023, supported by meetings of the Audit and Investment Committee and of the Personnel and Nominating Committee, the Supervisory Board considered the strategic planning, the efficiency of the company's management and the lawfulness and adequacy of the company's management. The topics addressed included the current trading position of the group, the principles of corporate governance and their implementation in the company, personnel matters, compliance and risk management\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### within the group, and also the strategic business plans.

On the basis of the dependency report the Supervisory Board has assured itself, in the presence of the independent auditor, that *Hawesko Holding SE* has not been disadvantaged in the past financial year by actions of its majority shareholder or by transactions with it. The Supervisory Board has therefore noted and approved the opinion issued by the independent auditor and issued two declarations:\n\n- Based on the conclusive findings of its examination, it raises no objections to the declaration by the Board of Management on related parties.\n- *Hawesko Holding SE* received appropriate consideration for each transaction based on the circumstances known to it at the time each transaction was conducted or each action was taken or omitted, and was therefore not disadvantaged by the action taken or omitted.\n\n#### **SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS**\n\n|                                    | Meetings | of which in<br>person | of which<br>virtual |\n|------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Supervisory board                  | 4        | 2                     | 2                   |\n| Audit and Investment Committee     | 5        | 2                     | 3                   |\n| Personnel and Nominating Committee | 4        | 2                     | 2                   |\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **WORK OF THE AUDIT AND INVESTMENT COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Audit and Investment Committee held meetings before the publication of each quarterly financial report and discussed these pursuant to Article 7.1.2. of the German Corporate Governance Code.

The accounts of the subsidiaries for 2022 were moreover considered in the presence of the independent auditor. At the end of the financial year the audit priorities for the 2024 financial statements were defined and the three-year plan and progress with strategic projects were addressed.\n\nDr. Jörg Haas was absent from the meeting on 2 August 2023. Apart from that instance, all members of the committee attended all meetings of the Audit and Investment Committee.\n\n#### **WORK OF THE PERSONNEL AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee addressed personnel matters with managers of the company at its meetings on 12 April, 12 June, 21 September and 14 December 2023.

The Annual Report is available online at www.hawesko-holding.com. The Supervisory Board examined the efficiency of its activities by way of self-evaluation, to assure effective control of the Board of Management, drawing on the specific professional knowledge and experience of the members of the Supervisory Board. Supervisory Board members fundamentally have the opportunity to receive professional training in the context of their duties, though this option was not taken up in the year under review.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION\n\n**B.

This organisational structure is useful because the wine trade depends to a great extent on nurturing and exploiting personal contacts with both producers and customers. The parent company *Hawesko Holding SE* normally holds 100 percent or a majority of the shares in the subsidiaries, which are active predominantly in the wine trade. The significant operationally active incorporated firms within the group of consolidated companies, above all *HAWESKO* and *Jacques',* are integrated into the group by means of profit transfer agreements with the holding company. The parent company *Hawesko Holding SE* and the majority of the subsidiaries are domiciled in the Federal Republic of Germany. The subsidiaries not based in Germany are all domiciled in other European Union countries or in Switzerland.\n\ncan also be consulted by shareholders and the public on the website of *Hawesko Holding SE* at\n\nthe end of the financial year, instead of within 90 days. This assures appropriate interest.\n\n**215**\n\n#### *1. No sustainability-related objectives in the corporate planning*\n\nArticle A.1 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the Board of Management shall systematically identify and assess the risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors, as well as the ecological and social impacts of the enterprise's activities. In addition to long-term economic objectives, the corporate strategy shall also give appropriate consideration to ecological and social objectives. Corporate planning shall include corresponding financial and sustainability-related objectives. In 2021 the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* approved a comprehensive sustainability strategy, embedded it at all companies of the group and is convinced that the long-term, sustainable further development of the group is not achievable without regard for the social and environmental factors of the enterprise's activities. The multi-year plan for the years beyond 2023 does not yet contain any non-financial or sustainability-related objectives. The Board of Management takes account of the relevant environmental and social factors in all entrepreneurial decisions, within its wider assessment, but believes it is reasonable always to consider all possible factors when reaching entrepreneurial decisions, without treating certain aspects as fundamentally more important than others.\n\n#### *2. No sustainability-related objectives in the internal control system and the risk management system*\n\nArticle A.3 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the internal control system and the risk management system shall also cover sustainability-related objectives, unless in any case required by law. This shall include processes and systems for collecting and processing sustainability-related data. As explained under Article 1, the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* has not previously approved any non-financial or sustainability-related objectives as part of the multi-year plan and has therefore not captured any firm non-financial or sustainability-related objectives in the internal control system and the risk management system. However its overall risk assessment identifies and assesses all risks, so environmental and social risks are likewise given consideration.\n\n#### *3. No stipulation of an age limit for service on the Supervisory Board*\n\nArticle C.2 of GCGC 2022 recommends stipulating an age limit for service on the Supervisory Board. Until now, the Supervisory Board of *Hawesko Holding SE* has not specified an age limit for serving on the Supervisory Board. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the decision on whether to remain a member is best left to the individual Supervisory Board member. An age limit to serving on the Supervisory Board would result in inappropriate restrictions.\n\n#### *4. Independence of the Chair of the Audit Committee*\n\nArticle C.10 of GCGC 2022 recommends that the Chair of the Audit Committee shall be independent of the controlling shareholder. The Chair of the Audit Committee Thomas R. Fischer, in his capacity as Board of Management member of Marcard, Stein & Co. AG, has business relations with Tocos Beteiligung GmbH (a major shareholder of *Hawesko Holding SE*) and with Detlev Meyer (Chair of the Supervisory Board of *Hawesko Holding SE*) and is therefore not independent of the controlling shareholder. The Supervisory Board is nevertheless convinced that Mr. Thomas R. Fischer is in every respect suited to the position of Chair of the Audit Committee in light of his qualifications, and bases his actions on the interests of the *Hawesko Group*.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *5.

From among its members it elects a person to act as Chair, and one or more Deputy Chairs. Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board are issued by the person acting as Chair or, if they are prevented from attending, by their Deputy. The Supervisory Board has a quorum if all members have been invited and at least half of the members take part in the vote. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are carried by a simple voting majority, unless otherwise specified by law or the articles of incorporation. In the event of a tied vote, a majority may resolve to conduct a fresh debate; otherwise a new vote must be held without delay. When voting anew on the same matter, the Chair has two votes if the result is once again a tie.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has formed two committees that perform the functions assigned to them on behalf of the whole Supervisory Board. The committees are convened by the person acting as their Chair and meet as often as is deemed necessary. There is currently a Personnel and Nominating Committee, and also an Audit\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee prepares the personnel decisions to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board, attends to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management, and also pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. It prepares the passing of resolutions by the whole Supervisory Board on the determination of Board of Management remuneration and the review of the remuneration system for the Board of Management, and deals with Board of Management contracts unless the German Stock Corporation Act specifies that they must be concluded, amended and terminated by the whole Supervisory Board. In addition, it proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the election of Supervisory Board members by the Annual General Meeting, taking into account the statutory requirements, the recommendations of GCGC and the requirements profile for the Supervisory Board resolved by the Supervisory Board. In doing so, in each case it assures itself that the person candidating is able to set aside the anticipated time required.

The Board of Management uses sales growth, operating EBIT, ROCE and free cash flow as the basis for its management approach.\n\nThe target minimum rates of return are presented in the \"Management system\" section of the combined management report. The targets and the development of the individual segments based on these benchmarks form part of the regular strategy and reporting discussions with the managing directors of the individual group companies. By incorporating EBIT margins and the return on capital employed into the objectives and target attainment checks, responsibility is clearly apportioned to the managing directors below Board of Management level.\n\nSince 1 January 2011 a compliance code passed and regularly reviewed by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board has been in place for all *Hawesko* group companies. The code of conduct for employees and the social media guidelines can be accessed at https://www.hawesko-holding.com/ueber-uns/corporate-governance/.\n\n#### *II. Shareholders and Annual General Meeting*\n\nThe shareholders of Hawesko Holding SE exercise their right to have a say in the running and supervision of the company through the Annual General Meeting. All shares are no par value bearer shares equipped with identical rights and obligations. Every share in Hawesko Holding SE carries one vote. The principle of \"one share, one vote\" is taken to its logical conclusion, as there are no caps on the number of voting rights which may be held by one shareholder, nor any special voting rights. Every shareholder is entitled to take part in the Annual General Meeting, to comment there on the individual agenda items and to demand information on matters concerning the company, to the extent that this is needed for the correct assessment of a matter being brought before the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting is held during the first six months of each financial year. Chairing of the Annual General Meeting is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board Chair or another member of the Supervisory Board nominated by the Chair. The Annual General Meeting fulfils all the tasks assigned to it by law. A resolution shall normally be carried by a simple majority or, in certain cases (including for resolutions on capital measures and amendments to the articles of incorporation) by a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented.\n\nDetlev Meyer is a Supervisory Board member and the biggest shareholder of Hawesko Holding SE, holding 72.6 percent of the shares through Tocos Beteiligung GmbH. There then follow the heirs of Michael Schiemann, with a 5.6 percent shareholding via Augendum Vermögensverwaltung GmbH. The remaining approx. 21.8 percent are held by institutional and private investors. There are no employee shares within the meaning of Sections 289a (1) first sentence No. 5 and 315a (1) first sentence No. 5 HGB.\n\n#### *III. Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises and oversees the Board of Management. To conduct important and fundamental transactions, the Supervisory Board must first give its consent by a two-thirds majority specifically to individual investments of a value of more than € 2.5 million and to the acquisition of other companies or the disposal of investments in companies with a value of more than € 0.5 million. A reporting system informs the Supervisory Board members monthly of key financial data compared with the target and prior-year figures,\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nand explains these. At least four ordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board as well as meetings of its committees take place each year.\n\nAccording to the articles of incorporation the Supervisory Board comprises six members, elected by the Annual General Meeting.

Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board are issued by the person acting as Chair or, if they are prevented from attending, by their Deputy.

The targets and the development of the individual segments based on these benchmarks form part of the regular strategy and reporting discussions with the managing directors of the individual group companies. By incorporating EBIT margins and the return on capital employed into the objectives and target attainment checks, responsibility is clearly apportioned to the managing directors below Board of Man-\n\nSince 1 January 2011 a compliance code passed and regularly reviewed by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board has been in place for all *Hawesko* group companies. The code of conduct for employees and the social media guidelines can be accessed at https://www.hawesko-holding.com/ueber-uns/corporate-gov-\n\nThe shareholders of Hawesko Holding SE exercise their right to have a say in the running and supervision of the company through the Annual General Meeting. All shares are no par value bearer shares equipped with identical rights and obligations. Every share in Hawesko Holding SE carries one vote. The principle of \"one share, one vote\" is taken to its logical conclusion, as there are no caps on the number of voting rights which may be held by one shareholder, nor any special voting rights. Every shareholder is entitled to take part in the Annual General Meeting, to comment there on the individual agenda items and to demand information on matters concerning the company, to the extent that this is needed for the correct assessment of a matter being brought before the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting is held during the first six months of each financial year. Chairing of the Annual General Meeting is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board Chair or another member of the Supervisory Board nominated by the Chair. The Annual General Meeting fulfils all the tasks assigned to it by law. A resolution shall normally be carried by a simple majority or, in certain cases (including for resolutions on capital measures and amendments to the articles of incorporation)\n\nDetlev Meyer is a Supervisory Board member and the biggest shareholder of Hawesko Holding SE, holding 72.6 percent of the shares through Tocos Beteiligung GmbH. There then follow the heirs of Michael Schiemann, with a 5.6 percent shareholding via Augendum Vermögensverwaltung GmbH. The remaining approx. 21.8 percent are held by institutional and private investors. There are no employee shares within the meaning\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises and oversees the Board of Management. To conduct important and fundamental transactions, the Supervisory Board must first give its consent by a two-thirds majority specifically to individual investments of a value of more than € 2.5 million and to the acquisition of other companies or the disposal of investments in companies with a value of more than € 0.5 million.

Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board has formed two committees that perform the functions assigned to them on behalf of the whole Supervisory Board. The committees are convened by the person acting as their Chair and meet as often as is deemed necessary. There is currently a Personnel and Nominating Committee, and also an Audit and Investment Committee, each comprising three members.\n\na) Personnel and Nominating Committee\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee prepares the personnel decisions to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board, attends to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management, and also pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. It prepares the passing of resolutions by the whole Supervisory Board on the determination of Board of Management remuneration and the review of the remuneration system for the Board of Management, and deals with Board of Management contracts unless the German Stock Corporation Act specifies that they must be concluded, amended and terminated by the whole Supervisory Board. In addition, it proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the election of Supervisory Board members by the Annual General Meeting, taking into account the statutory requirements, the recommendations of GCGC and the requirements profile for the Supervisory Board resolved by the Supervisory Board. In doing so, in each case it assures itself that the person candidating is able to set aside the anticipated time required. On personnel affairs, the committee also has the task of examining the appointment or dismissal of senior executives of the group to establish whether such actions serve the interests of early and balanced succession planning.\n\nThe Chair of the Personnel and Nominating Committee is Detlev Meyer. The other members are Wilhelm Weil and Kim-Eva Wempe.\n\n#### b) Audit and Investment Committee\n\n**216**\n\nThe Audit and Investment Committee deals with the supervision of accounting, the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the auditing of financial statements. It also prepares the resolution proposal of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting on the election of the auditors. If there is the intention to rotate auditors, the Audit and Investment Committee is responsible for the selection process.

The Supervisory Board considers that diversity aspects, alongside the specialist skills and experience of the Board of Management members, play an important role in the sustainable development of the company. A variety of personalities, experience and knowledge avoids groupthink, allows a rounded view and thus enriches the work of the Board of Management.

In view of the modest size of the Board of Management and the generally limited pool of suitable candidates, it is nevertheless not always possible to assure equal numbers of women and men. The legislator plans not to oblige an enterprise with a three-member Board of Management to include a woman among the members.

A variety of backgrounds in education, profession and experience is therefore expressly desired.

Modus operandi of the Board of Management*\n\nThe Board of Management is independently responsible for the running of the company and represents it in transactions with third parties. It coordinates the strategic direction of the group with the Supervisory Board and, in accordance with the legal requirements, informs the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively of all matters of relevance to the company with regard to planning, business developments and risks. The work of the Board of Management is set out in more detail in rules of procedure for the Board of Management.\n\nThe Board of Management reaches its decisions by a simple voting majority. The Board of Management members are responsible for their defined portfolio and area of work according to the allocation of duties schedule, independently of their collective responsibility for the management of the group. At the same time, the Board of Management members work together collegially and continually inform each other of important measures and events in their areas of work.\n\nWhen filling management functions in the Hawesko Group, the Board of Management strives for diversity and in the long term seeks a gender balance that reflects the employee structure.\n\nConflicts of interest of Board of Management members are to be disclosed without delay to the person holding the position of Chair of the Supervisory Board. The remaining Board of Management members are equally to be informed of the matter. Board of Management members may only take up secondary occupations, in particular non-executive directorships of companies outside the group, with the consent of the Supervisory Board. Material transactions between the group companies on the one hand and the Board of Management members as well as parties related to them on the other require the consent of the Supervisory Board.

Diversity concept for the Board of Management*\n\nAccording to Article 7 of the articles of incorporation, the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE* comprises at least two persons. The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board. The latter attends to long-term succession planning together with the Board of Management and pays heed to diversity in the composition of the Board of Management. In the interests of tailoring diversity aspects more accurately, the Supervisory Board approved a diversity concept for the Board of Management in April 2018 and supplemented this diversity concept in April 2023 with essential expertise in sustainability in light of the provisions of GCGC 2022.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### a) Objective of the diversity concept\n\nThe Board of Management performs the pivotal role in the further development of *Hawesko Holding SE* and of the group. The Supervisory Board considers that diversity aspects, alongside the specialist skills and experience of the Board of Management members, play an important role in the sustainable development of the company. A variety of personalities, experience and knowledge avoids groupthink, allows a rounded view and thus enriches the work of the Board of Management. The following diversity aspects serve as guidelines for long-term succession planning and the selection of suitable candidates.\n\n#### b) Diversity aspects\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\nFurther information on the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as on its work alongside the Board of Management in the period under review is provided in the report of the Supervisory Board.

Diversity concept for the Board of Management* \n\nlight of the provisions of GCGC 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board seeks a composition for the Board of Management where the members complement each other in terms of their personal and professional background, experience and specialist knowledge, so that the Board of Management as a whole can draw on as wide as possible a range of experience, knowledge and skills. Notwithstanding the following diversity aspects, the Supervisory Board is convinced that an allround appraisal of each individual is the only basis for appointment to the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\n#### (i) Proportion of women on the Board of Management\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes the equal participation of women and men as its basis for the composition of the Board of Management and actively promotes that goal, including by specifically searching for female candidates to join the Board of Management. In view of the modest size of the Board of Management and the generally limited pool of suitable candidates, it is nevertheless not always possible to assure equal numbers of women and men. The legislator plans not to oblige an enterprise with a three-member Board of Management to include a woman among the members. Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board has set a proportion of 0 to 35 percent as the target level for women on the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*, to be achieved by 30 June 2026.\n\n#### (ii) Educational and professional background\n\nDiversity on the Board of Management is also reflected in the individual horizons of training and experience as well as in the variety of career backgrounds of its members (for example, industry experience). A variety of backgrounds in education, profession and experience is therefore expressly desired. Every Board of Management member must, however, be equipped to perform the duties of a Board of Management member in an internationally active, listed enterprise on the strength of their personal and specialist competencies, and to uphold the public image of the *Hawesko Group*. The members of the Board of Management should moreover possess an in-depth understanding of the business of the *Hawesko Group* and generally possess several years of leadership experience. In addition, with regard to the group's business model at least one member should possess particular expertise in each of the following areas, bearing in mind that this expertise need not necessarily have been acquired through university studies or another form of training; it may also have been acquired by other means or within the *Hawesko Group*:\n\n• Strategy and strategic leadership\n\n**222**\n\n• Logistics business including the relevant markets and customer requirements\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\n*CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION* HAWESKO HOLDING SE\n\n**D.

The Board of Management comprises individuals with a variety of career backgrounds and horizons of experience, and possesses expertise in the areas stated. The defined target for the proportion of women is met. The Supervisory Board as well as its Personnel and Nominating Committee will take account of the above diversity aspects as part of their long-term succession planning and in their search for suitable candidates for the Board of Management of *Hawesko Holding SE*.\n\n#### (v) Succession planning\n\nAccording to Article B.2 of GCGC 2022, the Supervisory Board is to attend to long-term succession planning jointly with the Board of Management. For that reason, it is envisaged that on personnel matters the Personnel and Nominating Committee must approve the appointment or dismissal of senior executives on the first tier below Board of Management or of the managing directors of group companies. In addition, either the Supervisory Board or one of its committees regularly invites prominent, key people from the *Hawesko Group* to attend its meetings as guests, and to discuss with them current business developments that affect their specific area. This approach enables the Supervisory Board to regularly form its own, direct impression of especially important management functions, incorporating both personal and professional perspectives. Furthermore, group-wide, internal management development programmes were implemented in recent years so that key positions within the group can increasingly be filled internally.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **D.
