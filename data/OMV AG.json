It encourages increased channeling of investments by companies, investors, and policymakers to where they are most needed for sustainable development. Therefore, the EU Taxonomy Regulation will play an important role in scaling up sustainable investments and implementing the European Green Deal.\n\nOMV has been a member of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, the permanent expert group of the European Commission that was established under Article 20 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, since October 2022 and has assisted the Commission in developing its sustainable finance policies, notably the further development of the EU taxonomy.\n\nFor the OMV Group, the EU taxonomy provides a means to assess which of our current and future economic activities can be classed as environmentally sustainable. According to the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity identified in this category must make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU's environmental objectives, in addition to not significantly harming any of the objectives and meeting the defined minimum social safeguards. The six relevant environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation are:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nIn June 2021, the Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act, establishing the criteria that define which activities substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the first two out of the six environmental objectives. The disclosure requirements were effective for reports published since January 1, 2022, in relation to the aforementioned climate change objectives. In 2022, the Complementary Climate Delegated Act was released, which extends the EU taxonomy framework to\n\npermit certain economic activities involving gas and nuclear energy to be classified as \"environmentally sustainable\" and came into effect on January 1, 2023. The EU taxonomy for the four remaining environmental objectives and the amendments to the Annexes of the Disclosures Delegated Act were published in June 2023 by the European Commission.\n\n## OMV's Process for Identifying and Assessing EU Taxonomy Activities\n\n### **EU Taxonomy Eligibility Assessment**\n\nAn economic activity is considered to be taxonomy-eligible if it matches the description of the activity given in the EU taxonomy. In order to identify eligible activities/products at OMV, we performed a screening of the full portfolio of OMV activities and compared our activities to the description of the economic activities/products listed in Annex I or II of the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and Annex I–IV of the EU Taxonomy Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nThe assessment of eligible activities and products at OMV is carried out by an interdisciplinary project team, using both a bottom-up and a top-down approach. A series of internal meetings and training sessions with management and experts was held in order to give OMV businesses an introduction to the new EU taxonomy and disclosure requirements. A further series of workshops was held with all business segments and corporate entities to ensure the bottom-up identification of eligible activities, assets, processes, and related eligible CAPEX/OPEX/turnover. OMV's identified EU taxonomy-eligible economic activities are mainly related to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, and one activity is related to the environmental objective of the transition to a circular economy. Analysis of all our economic activities is done on an annual basis and includes an update of the previous year's assessment.\n\n#### **EU Taxonomy Alignment Assessment**\n\nIn 2022, OMV carried out an alignment assessment based on the EU taxonomy criteria and this was updated over the course of 2023. The assessment had the purpose of identifying whether any newly identified eligible activities fulfilled the criteria for substantial contribution to the climate mitigation objective or climate adaption environmental objective, the do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria of the other environmental objectives, and the minimum social safeguards criteria. Note that no comparison figures are available for the four additional environmental goals for the reporting year 2022. The economic activities that OMV identified as aligning with the EU taxonomy are all related to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation. The alignment assessment of OMV's eligible activities according to the EU Taxonomy Environmental Delegated\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house. The icon is likely used to represent a home or a place to live.\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nAct will be done in line with the legal requirements as of next year.\n\nResponsibility for the alignment checks and evidence gathering was clearly defined in the OMV Group's EU Taxonomy Guidance. The project/asset managers for the respective eligible project/activity were responsible for assessing compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution and the respective DNSH criteria. Support was provided by the OMV Group Sustainability team and sustainability experts from OMV Petrom and Borealis. The required physical climate risk and vulnerability assessments to comply with the DNSH climate change adaptation criteria were performed centrally by OMV Group Sustainability in conjunction with Corporate Risk Management, and with the support of an external provider in line with the OMV Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management approach.\n\nIn general, the main taxonomy-eligible business activities for OMV relate to activity \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\", activity \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" and activity \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids\". More detailed information can be found in the respective KPI section (Turnover, CAPEX, OPEX).\n\nThe assessment of compliance with the minimum social safeguards and governance criteria was performed by OMV Group Sustainability by assessing whether the clauses in relevant OMV policies (Human Rights Policy, Code of Conduct, Code of Business Ethics, Tax Strategy) are in line with the international standards referred to in the EU taxonomy. It was further assessed whether OMV's human rights management system and its related processes (e.g., grievance mechanisms, community consultation) are established in line with these international standards. The detailed assessment showed no gaps between the OMV Group's approach to human rights policies, addressing of impacts, due diligence and risk assessment procedures, communication, grievance mechanisms, consumer interests, anti-corruption, competition, or taxation and the social safeguard requirements laid out in the EU taxonomy. For more details on the unadjusted gender pay gap and the Board gender diversity, please refer to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion chapter, and Workforce Data.\n\nNo relevant final liability regarding breaches of the minimum safeguards have been identified at OMV in recent years, including breach of labor law or human rights, breach of corruption or competition laws, or breach of tax laws.\n\n#### **Definition of Financial KPIs**\n\nOMV's values for the KPIs are derived from the figures reported in the Group's consolidated IFRS financial statements.\n\nThe KPIs are calculated based on the sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX of all fully consolidated subsidiaries of the OMV Group. Subsidiaries that are not consolidated, associated companies, and joint ventures were excluded from the calculation of KPIs as per the reporting requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in the sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX (the \"alignment ratio\") has been calculated as the part of sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX derived from products and services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by the total sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX (denominator). The same logic applies to the calculation of the \"eligibility ratio.\"\n\nThe denominators for the financial KPIs were defined and can be reconciled with the IFRS Group financial statements as follows:\n\n- The denominator of the turnover KPI is based on OMV's consolidated sales revenues [(OMV Consoli](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/6-sales-revenues)[dated Financial Statements 2023, Note 6](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/6-sales-revenues) ). For further details on our accounting policies regarding consolidated sales revenues, see [OMV Consolidated Finan](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion2)[cial Statements 2023, Note 3.2b.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion2)\n- The denominator for the CAPEX KPI consists of additions to intangible assets (including oil and gas properties with unproved reserves), tangible assets, and IFRS 16 right-of-use assets (see OMV Consolidated Financial Statements 2022, [Notes 16](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-statement-of-financial-position/16-intangible-assets.html) and [17](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-statement-of-financial-position/17-property-plant-and-equipment.html)). Additions from business combinations are included in the denominator, except for additions to goodwill. Decommissioning assets are not included in the denominator. Additions included in the denominator deviate from additions according to the IFRS Group financial statements because government grants are not considered in the denominator while the net presentation option is applied for the IFRS Group financial statements. For further details on our accounting policies regarding the relevant assets, see [OMV Consolidated Financial Statements 2023, Notes](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion7) [3.2g, h, and p.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion7)\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside of a circle. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow inside of a circle. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside of a circle.\n\n- Total OPEX consists of R&D expenses, maintenance and repair costs, other direct expenditure related to day-to-day servicing of assets, and short-term leases. R&D expenses include the research and development expenses recognized according to IAS 38 and reported in the line \"Other operating expenses\" in the income statement (see [OMV Consoli](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/10-other-operating-expenses)[dated Financial Statements 2023, Note 10](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/10-other-operating-expenses) ). Maintenance and repair costs and other direct expenditure related to dayto-day servicing of assets mainly include costs for external services, personnel expenses, and material costs related to regular and unplanned maintenance, repairs, and servicing measures. The related cost items can be found in the line items \"Production and operating expenses\" and \"Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses\" in the income statement. Expenses for short-term leases have been determined and included in line with IFRS 16. Direct costs for training and other human resources improvement needs are immaterial and therefore excluded from the denominator and the numerator.\nFor most of the activities, sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX for aligned and eligible activities could be allocated directly to individual activities listed in the taxonomy based on data available in the Group entities' ERP systems. This ensured that there was no double counting of aligned or eligible sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX. In the refineries, CAPEX for assets used for the joint production of organic basic chemicals and fuels has been allocated to the taxonomy-eligible activity \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals.\" Also, this has been allocated to non-eligible activities using an allocation key reflecting the yield, size, and complexity of the different refinery plants used for this purpose. The same approach was used for repair and maintenance expenses for cost centers, which are involved in the production of organic basic chemicals and fuels.\n\nThe method of calculating the KPIs was changed in 2023 to fully implement the guidance published by the European Commission in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).4 Grants deducted from CAPEX in the financial statements are now excluded from the CAPEX KPI in the numerator and denominator. In addition, turnover, CAPEX, and OPEX from assets held for sale (IFRS 5) have been included since January 1, 2023, in the calculation of all three KPIs. Prior-year KPIs were not adjusted. The impact of these changes would have been immaterial. Total government grants related to assets and deducted from CAPEX in 2022 amounted to EUR 5.4 mn. Total sales revenues related to IFRS 5 disposal groups amounted to EUR 3,838.1 mn in 2022 and were mainly associated with the nitrogen division at Borealis and the retail business in Slovenia. Total CAPEX related to IFRS 5 disposal groups amounted to EUR 5.9 mn.\n\n|                                                           |        |          |        |       |        | 2023 |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------|------|--|\n|                                                           |        | Turnover |        | CAPEX |        | OPEX |  |\n|                                                           | EUR mn | %        | EUR mn | %     | EUR mn | %    |  |\n| Environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned) activities | 69     | 0.2      | 415    | 10.5  | 3      | 0.3  |  |\n| Taxonomy-eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned activities    | 7,135  | 18.1     | 1,096  | 27.7  | 347    | 42.1 |  |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities                          | 32,259 | 81.7     | 2,441  | 61.8  | 474    | 57.5 |  |\n| Total                                                     | 39,463 |          | 3,952  |       | 824    |      |  |\n\n|                                                           |        | Turnover |       | CAPEX  |     | 2022<br>OPEX |   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-------|--------|-----|--------------|---|\n|                                                           |        | EUR mn   | %     | EUR mn | %   | EUR mn       | % |\n| Environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned) activities | 37     | 0.1      | 347   | 9.5    | 0   | 0.0          |   |\n| Taxonomy-eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned activities    | 10,398 | 17.8     | 1,252 | 34.2   | 321 | 41.1         |   |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities                          | 48,025 | 82.1     | 2,060 | 56.3   | 458 | 58.8         |   |\n| Total                                                     | 58,460 |          | 3,659 |        | 779 |              |   |\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Eligible and Taxonomy-Aligned Turnover**\n\nIn 2023, 18.1% (2022: 17.8%) of OMV's total turnover was classified as taxonomy-eligible (non-aligned), while 0.2% (2022: 0.1%) of OMV's total turnover was classified as taxonomy-aligned. In 2023, all taxonomy-eligible/aligned turnover was related to the objective of climate change mitigation.\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Eligible Turnover 2023**\n\nThe eligible turnover arose from activities \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" which reflects the activities of our C&M segment (e.g., production of polyolefins), and \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals,\" also coming from the C&M segment (e.g., production of ethylene and propylene), as well as activity\n\nEU Commission: [Commission Notice](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C_202300305) on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (second Commission Notice), C/2023/305, October 20, 2023 4\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons.

The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside of a circle.\n\n\"4.29 Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels,\" mainly from power sales from the Brazi gas-fired power plant in Romania. Furthermore, the activities \"4.30 Highefficiency co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous fuels\" and \"5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste\" contributed to the taxonomy-eligible turnover.\n\nThe majority of aligned turnover in 2023 was derived from the activity \"4.25 Production of heat/cool using waste heat,\" which reflects the waste heat supplies from the Schwechat refinery. Another contribution arose from activity \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" with Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH processing postconsumer plastics and turning them into high-quality LDPE recyclates. Further minor contributions to aligned turnover resulted from the activity \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids,\" which covers the sales of sustainable aviation fuels, as well as from the activity \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport,\" which covers hydrogen sales for mobility purposes.\n\nElectricity produced from renewables, such as the generation of electricity using solar photovoltaic technology and wind power, is used for internal consumption only.\n\nThe split of aligned and eligible turnover between revenue from contracts with customers and revenue within the scope of IFRS 9 is included in the following table. Eligible revenue from transactions within the scope of IFRS 9 includes power sales from the gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\n### **Taxonomy-Aligned Turnover 2023**\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/7 description: This image is a donut chart that shows the percentage of eligible, aligned, non-aligned, and non-eligible items. 81.7% are non-eligible (2022: 82.1%), 0.2% are aligned (2022: <0.1%), 18.1% are non-aligned (2022: 17.8%), and 18.3% are eligible (2022: 17.9%).

Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment.\" Under the circular economy objective, the activity \"2.7 Sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous waste\" can be reported, reflecting OMV's joint venture with Interzero to build and operate Europe's largest sorting facility for chemical recycling. In 2023, CAPEX of EUR 107.4 mn was related to business combinations (2022: nil), of which EUR 28.1 mn was related to intangible assets and EUR 79.3 mn to tangible assets.\n\nThe largest contributors to aligned CAPEX were activities \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals,\" which reflects our investment in Borealis' propane dehydrogenation unit 2 (PDH2) in Kallo, and \"9.1 Close to market research, development, and innovation,\" which stems from the investment in the ReOil® 2000 chemical recycling demonstration plant at the Schwechat refinery. Other contributors to taxonomy-aligned CAPEX were the following activities: \"3.10 Manufacture of hydrogen\" (e.g., UpHy project), \"4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\" (e.g., PV plant in Arbesthal, PV plant in Würmlach), \"4.3 Electricity generation from wind power\" (e.g., Gullfaks Hywind Tampen project), \"4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity\" (e.g., renewable electricity transmission line to Edvard Grieg field), \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids\" (e.g., production facilities for sustainable aviation fuels and Glycerin to Propanol activities at the Schwechat refinery), \"4.25 Production of heat/cool using waste heat\" (e.g., district heating hub at the Schwechat refinery), \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport\" (e.g., hydrogen filling stations, electric charging points), and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies\" (e.g., installation of PV panels and heat pumps).\n\nThe rise in total aligned CAPEX in 2023 in comparison to 2022 is mainly due to the turnaround of the Petrobrazi refinery, the new aromatic complex project being executed and shown under the activities \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\" and \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport,\" mainly reflecting electric vehicle (EV) charging station projects at various locations.\n\nAligned and eligible CAPEX can be disaggregated into additions to the different asset classes in the table below.

In 2023, all taxonomy-eligible/aligned OPEX was related to the objective of climate change mitigation.\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Eligible OPEX 2023**\n\nThe largest contributors to eligible OPEX were the activities \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form\" and \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals,\" both reflecting the activities of our C&M segment, as well as the activity \"4.29 Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels.\" Other contributors were the activity \"9.1 Close to market research, development, and innovation\" (e.g., R&D into ReOil®), along with various activities from Section 6 Transport (e.g., infrastructure for rail transportation). Furthermore, eligible OPEX resulted from the activities \"5.12 Underground permanent geological storage of CO2” (e.g., CCS activity offshore to the south of Norway) and \"7.2 Renovation of existing buildings.\"\n\nAligned OPEX was mainly derived from the activities \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form\" (Ecoplast), \"4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\" (PV plants, e.g., Lobau, Schönkirchen, Arbesthal), and \"4.25 Production of heat/cool using waste heat\" (district heating hub at the Schwechat refinery).\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Aligned OPEX 2023**\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/9 description: The image shows a breakdown of the Taxonomy-Aligned OPEX for 2023 in EUR mn. A donut chart shows that 57.5% is non-eligible, 42.5% is eligible, and 0.3% is aligned. A table shows the breakdown of the aligned OPEX, with 2 for manufacture of plastics in primary form, 0 for electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology, and 1 for production of heat/cool using waste heat, for a total of 3.\n\n| Other eligible activities | 347 | 321 |\n|---------------------------|-----|-----|\n| Non-eligible activities   | 474 | 458 |\n| Total Non-Aligned OPEX    | 821 | 779 |\n\nSee EU Taxonomy Data for details.\n\n|                                      | 2023                   |                                             | 2022                   |                                             |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | Aligned OPEX<br>EUR mn | Eligible<br>(non-aligned)<br>OPEX<br>EUR mn | Aligned OPEX<br>EUR mn | Eligible<br>(non-aligned)<br>OPEX<br>EUR mn |\n| Research and development expenses    | –                      | 43                                          | –                      | 29                                          |\n| Expenses for maintenance and repairs | 3                      | 299                                         | 0                      | 280                                         |\n| Short-term lease expenses            | –                      | 5                                           | –                      | 12                                          |\n| Total                                | 3                      | 347                                         | 0                      | 321                                         |\n\n### Outlook\n\nOMV has a clear commitment to becoming a net-zero company by 2050 and has set ambitious GHG reduction targets for 2030 and 2040 across all GHG scopes. In order to achieve those targets, a significant amount of CAPEX will be allocated to low-carbon business projects and activities between now and 2030. Organic CAPEX growth will be\n\ndriven by investments in sustainable and low-carbon projects in all three business segments of OMV. For the period 2022–2030, around 40% of the average annual organic CAPEX of around EUR 3.5 bn will be low-carbon CAPEX. In total, OMV will invest EUR 13 bn in low-carbon business solutions between 2022 and 2030.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The Remuneration Committee is authorized to determine the Executive Board's remuneration, including the structure of the remuneration system and the actual target achievement. The Executive Board remuneration consists of fixed and variable remuneration elements. Selected employees at senior management level are also eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The variable remuneration – LTIP and the annual bonus – includes performance criteria related to the Company's sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) performance. Long-term shareholder and other stakeholder interests are reflected in the performance-related remuneration, which includes both long-term and shortterm elements.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board was approved at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June 2022 and was effective in 2023. It sets out GHG and ESG targets as forming part of the annual bonus and LTIP. 15% of the annual bonus depends on the achievement of the defined reduction of net absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. 20% of the LTIP is based on the achievement of ESG targets and includes the reduction of the net carbon intensity of energy supply. The GHG targets in the annual bonus (i.e., reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and the LTIP (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of energy supply) are clearly linked and directly derived from the OMV Group GHG emissions reduction targets for 2030 and the required reduction pathways up to 2030 compared to the base year 2019. This means the achievement of the GHG targets set out in the annual bonus and the LTIP requires OMV to implement the defined decarbonization pathway to achieve its 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets, which include the reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30%, the reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 20%, and the reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply by 20% – all compared to the base year, 2019.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has established an OMVspecific catalog of criteria derived from OMV's Strategy 2030, among which are strategic GHG emissions reduction KPIs that steer OMV's decarbonization actions up to 2030. These include the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and the reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee chooses the specific ESG targets and their weighting for each LTIP tranche based on this catalog. Within the ESG targets, GHG emissions reduction will always constitute a target in the LTIP. GHG and ESG targets and their weighting are published in the Remuneration Report for the grant year, which can be\n\nfound on the [OMV website.](https://www.omv.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/general-meeting/past-years) Based on predefined criteria (e.g., fatalities, TRIR, process safety – also in comparison to industry benchmarks), a health and safety malus of between 0.8 and 1.0 is applied to the overall target achievement for both the annual bonus and the LTIP. In the event of severe incidents, the Remuneration Committee may reduce the payout to zero. This malus considers OMV's commitment to health and workplace safety.\n\nAn external review of actual target achievement is performed by the Group's auditor, and the results are communicated to the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board.\n\n## Materiality\n\nOMV identifies material content for the Sustainability Report in an extensive and structured process of consultation with the Company's external and internal stakeholders.\n\nOMV last comprehensively updated its materiality analysis of sustainability topics in compliance with the legal requirements related to the disclosure of non-financial information in Austria (Nachhaltigkeits- und Diversitätsverbesserungsgesetz; NaDiVeG) and the GRI Standards in 2020. The detailed process used to determine the current list of material topics can be found in the [Sustainability](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2020/sustainability-at-omv/sustainability-framework/materiality-and-stakeholders.html) [Report 2020](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2020/sustainability-at-omv/sustainability-framework/materiality-and-stakeholders.html). Stakeholder interests, the significant external economic, environmental, and social impacts of OMV's business, as well as the financial materiality and business relevance of these topics to OMV were essential to this process. Impacts (both by OMV and on OMV, i.e., \"Inside-Out\" and \"Outside-In\") and the relevance to stakeholders were considered across the entire OMV value chain. We conducted this process together with an external party in order to maintain an objective and independent view on the material topics. The extensive materiality analysis involving internal and external stakeholders will be repeated every three years, or if significant changes in the business or market environment occur.\n\nWe reviewed the results of the materiality analysis again as part of our strategy update in late 2021. During this review, some material topics were split into two individual material topics: \"Climate Change and Energy Transition\" was split into \"Carbon Emissions Reduction\" and \"Energy Transition,\" \"Health, Safety, and Security\" was split into \"Health, Safety, and Well-Being\" and \"Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience,\" and \"Human Rights and Communities\" was split into \"Human Rights\" and \"Communities.\" This was due to the prominence of the individual topics and the differences in their management approaches. In addition, \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" was raised from being an aspect of the topic \"Employees\"\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / SUSTAINABILITY AT OMV\".

The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nto an individual material topic due to its central nature to the Company's sustainability strategy. As a result, OMV now has a total of twelve material topics. The results of the 2020 materiality analysis and the changes in 2021 were acknowledged by the OMV Executive Board. No changes were made to the material topics in 2022. In 2023, the OMV Group started a materiality assessment according to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the preliminary results do not show any significant deviations from the currently reported material topics.\n\nIn this Report, we disclose in detail the twelve material topics that are viewed as being most material to OMV and our stakeholders. In the following sections of the Report, we present the management approaches, governance processes, KPIs, key actions in 2023, outlook, and strategic targets for each of these material topics. The Sustainability Report is structured around the focus areas and material topics.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. The Environmental section includes Climate Change, Carbon Emissions Reduction, Energy Transition, Natural Resources Management, Circular Economy, and Environment. The Social section includes Health, Safety, and Security, Health, Safety, and Well-Being, Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience, People, Human Rights, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Employees, and Communities. The Governance section includes Ethical Business Practices, Economic Impacts and Business Principles, and Supply Chain.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOMV's goal is to transform from an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company into a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials, leveraging opportunities in the circular economy. An integral part of the Group's strategy is its ambition to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050 for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In view of the ongoing transformation in the energy industry and a global goal of net-zero emissions, OMV is building on its strengths and seizing opportunities to position itself competitively. Our sustainability ambitions, especially getting to net zero, can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. In our Strategy 2030, we have earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn for the purpose of achieving our emissions reduction targets.\n\n## Sustainability Criteria in Investment Decisions\n\nIn 2022, OMV updated its Capital Allocation Framework and developed a strategic scoring methodology for investment projects based on four pillars: business strategic targets, financial metrics, risk profile, and climate targets impact. This new methodology has been tested in a pilot phase. The scoring helps to objectively define and review OMV's most important strategic projects and allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support our strategy delivery, including our GHG reduction pathway. Climate scoring is an integral part of this overall scoring and covers the investment's impact on the OMV Group's Scope 1, 2, and 3 climate targets for 2030, as well as EU taxonomy relevance.\n\nAs part of the updated Capital Allocation Framework, OMV also introduced a new definition for \"sustainability CAPEX,\" which encompasses investments that meet one of two criteria: either they are aligned with the EU taxonomy or they are investments that support the implementation of OMV's 2030 Sustainability Framework. The latter includes investments related to methane leakage detection and repair, energy efficiency programs, chemical recycling, and community investments classified as strategic social investments, among others.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing, with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing, and it surrounds the house. The icon is clean and modern, and it would be easily recognizable as a symbol for home or housing.\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/2 description: The image contains three icons. The first icon is a printer inside of a circle. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow inside of a circle. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside of a circle.\n\nFor sustainability projects to pass the final investment decision, different financial hurdles apply compared to those applicable to the rest of the projects in the portfolio. Thus, \"sustainability CAPEX\" projects use distinct \"weighted average cost of capital (WACC)\" rates that consider the specific risks of sustainability projects (usually lower compared to other projects) and a payback period of <20 years (longer than for other projects). The goal of the new Capital Allocation Framework is to facilitate investments in projects aligned with our climate targets, including our long-term net zero target, rather than traditional fossil fuel-related investments.\n\nMoreover, inorganic growth projects should comply with the overall Group path to net zero by 2050 and should support the low-carbon growth of OMV. The potential impact of mergers and acquisitions on OMV's climate targets is reviewed as part of due diligence.\n\n## Environmental, Social, and Governance Ratings and Indices\n\nOMV actively engages with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating agencies and socially responsible investors to ensure that the information our external stakeholders need to evaluate sustainability risks and opportunities related to the Company's performance is disclosed. At OMV, we place great importance on working with the ESG rating agencies, and their questionnaires and feedback provide a means for OMV to assess any additional ESG data gaps. This helps us drive our sustainability agenda forward and make continuous improvements in terms of sustainability.\n\n## Latest Ratings and Indices Results\n\nOMV actively participates in several ESG ratings.

The Group's risk management processes focus on the identification, assessment, and evaluation of such risks and their impact on the Group's financial stability and profitability. The purpose of these activities is to actively manage risks in the context of the Group's risk appetite and defined risk tolerance levels in order to achieve the OMV Group's long-term strategic goals.\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks are regularly identified, assessed, and reported through the Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process. The main purpose of the OMV Group's EWRM process is to deliver value through riskbased management and decision-making, which is ensured by applying a \"three lines of defense\" model (1. business management, 2. risk management and oversight functions, 3. internal audit). The OMV Group is continually enhancing the EWRM process based on internal and external requirements, for instance developing new ESG reporting standards and frameworks. The process is facilitated by a Group-wide IT system that supports the established individual process steps, guided by the ISO 31000 risk management framework. The process also includes companies that are not fully consolidated.\n\n## Governance\n\nOMV recognizes the dynamic and evolving nature of its business landscape. Effective risk governance is crucial for successfully navigating uncertainties inherent in the nature of OMV's operations.\n\nAs an integral part of the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee diligently oversees the implementation and efficacy of our risk management processes. By leveraging the expertise within the Audit Committee and remaining adaptive through ongoing education, the Supervisory Board reinforces its commitment to robust risk governance.\n\nThe Executive Board takes a proactive stance in overseeing and enhancing OMV's risk management processes, as well as ensuring a strong risk culture across the OMV Group. A crossfunctional committee chaired by the OMV Group CFO with senior management members of the OMV Group – the Risk Committee – ensures that the risk management process effectively captures and manages material risks across the OMV Group. OMV has an effective independent Corporate Risk Management function within the CFO area that reports directly\n\nto the Executive Board and is independent from the business lines. OMV's Executive Board members regularly discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, related developments in the fuels, chemicals, and gas markets, the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations, the status of innovation project implementation, and progress on achieving sustainabilityrelated targets.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee meets at least four times a year, ensuring that risk awareness and prevention are firmly integrated into decision-making processes. The Committee validates the key non-financial and financial risks identified with respect to OMV's short- to mid- (up to three to five years) and long-term (more than five years) objectives. For more information, see the [Annual Report.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/governance)\n\nOMV focuses on assessing the potential vulnerabilities of the Company to climate change (e.g., water scarcity, droughts, floods, and landslides), the impact of the Company on the environment, and the mitigation actions that will ensure a successful transition to a low-carbon environment (e.g., reduction of carbon emissions and compliance with new regulatory requirements). The short- and midterm physical vulnerabilities related to climate change are identified and reported in the EWRM process and do not exceed OMV's reporting threshold.\n\nThe OMV Group conducts a robust, site-specific physical climate risk and vulnerability assessment in accordance with the EU taxonomy to determine the resilience of each asset to future climate change and the associated physical climate-related risks. Acute and chronic risks related to temperature, wind, water, and solid mass are first screened based on business specificity and potential impact on OMV. The two-fold approach used is in line with the EWRM approach.\n\nBased on the preselected acute and chronic risks, all OMV Group sites where EU taxonomy-eligible activities occur are prioritized. This exercise is performed with the support of a risk intelligence consultant using a set of indexes specifically aimed at providing a robust understanding of the changes in future environmental conditions for the respective locations and businesses.\n\nAll assets with medium, high, or extreme exposure to one or more acute or chronic physical climate risks are analyzed further. Physical hazard modeling is applied, consisting of the processing and analysis of atmospheric data related to temperature, precipitation, drought, and wildfires, as well as other data related to coastal flooding, tropical cyclones, water stress, and fluvial flooding, in order to provide a rigorous estimate of risk. The analysis incorporates scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The four RCPs (2.6, 4.5,\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a triangular roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house. The icon is likely used to represent a home or a place of residence.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n6.0, and 8.5) included in the IPCC AR5 are used in this exercise and applied to various time horizons that align with the OMV Strategy. Once the financial impact of the respective risks is estimated, potential mitigation strategies are discussed with management in order to ensure that appropriate adaptation measures are considered.\n\n## Risk Management Process\n\nThe risk management process combines an intensive bottomup and top-down approach, with every single employee responsible for implementing the most appropriate mitigation strategies for the risks within their sphere of responsibilities. Identified and assessed risks are controlled and mitigated at all organizational levels thanks to clearly defined risk policies and responsibilities. Strategic risks and opportunities (e.g., related to climate change or water stress) are assessed in a top-down process, while a bottom-up process with a standardized methodology is used to assess factors such as environmental aspects, impacts, and risks in our operations, including legal and compliance risks.\n\nESG risks are identified using a double materiality approach and a selection of the appropriate risk identification techniques, such as interviews, workshops, surveys, and analyses of historical losses, as well as information on risks documented in risk registers or loss databases. For example, environmental risks are identified using an approach such as a standardized environmental risk assessment methodology, always applying a double materiality approach whenever possible. Environmental risks and opportunities include regulatory, operational, reputational, and financial drivers, and specifically relate to issues such as climate change, availability and quality of water used for operations, and the impact of energy, climate, and water policies. Such risks are then analyzed against a short-term horizon (less than 3 years), mediumterm horizon (3–5 years), or long-term perspective (>10 years), including their possible quantitative impact as a deviation of cash flow from the plan and the likelihood of such an impact. Heat maps or risk matrices are used to support the assessment process and serve to identify probability ranges and the related consequences if risks were to materialize. Digital technologies are used in monitoring and managing environmental risks through a special risk management IT tool that integrates environmental risk scenarios with operational and business risks.\n\nFor the purpose of identifying such risks, we continuously monitor OMV's internal and external environment and conduct interviews with senior management, subject matter experts, and Executive Board members. This process complements the bottom-up approach and captures the risks inherent in the strategy. We collect information on root causes, consequences, corresponding risk mitigation actions and their effectiveness, and changes in internal and external factors influencing likelihood. These are assessed in working sessions with senior management and subject matter experts.\n\nAll risks exceeding a certain threshold at Group level are included in the Group Risk Report and considered to be substantive irrespective of their probability. However, the threshold can vary depending on the management focus for that specific risk management measure. In addition, risks are regarded as substantive if they are seen as such by relevant stakeholders, including local communities, government authorities, employees, or suppliers, even when the financial impact is not considerable.\n\nBottom-up and top-down perspectives are combined to provide a comprehensive risk profile of the organization, which is taken into consideration when the OMV strategy is developed or updated. The results of an intensive reporting exercise are discussed at the OMV Executive Board level through the Group Risk Report and further presented to the OMV Audit Committee.\n\n## Risk Taxonomy\n\nPaying attention to every single risk makes risk management a holistic process. We use common risk terminology and language across OMV to facilitate effective risk communication. ESG risks are a key element in the OMV risk taxonomy.\n\nThe full spectrum of risks relating to OMV's business, including economic, environmental, and social issues, is analyzed using either a semi-qualitative or quantitative approach and documented in a centralized risk repository. The resulting corporate risk profile provides a holistic view of issues that could affect the Company's medium- and long-term performance. The profile is therefore integrated into OMV's decision-making processes.\n\nAccording to the OMV risk taxonomy, the following risk categories are considered based on key risk drivers:\n\n- Financial risks, including market price risks, foreign exchange risks, and risks arising from (European) Emission Allowances. Market price risks are monitored and analyzed centrally with respect to their potential cash flow impact using a specific risk analysis model that considers portfolio effects. Such market price risks also cover the impact of volatile prices for European Emission Allowances, where typical mitigation activities like spot, forward, or futures transactions are applied to ensure a balanced position of emission allowances by selling the surplus or covering the gap.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Additional information on the OMV Group's EWRM governance and processes as well as major financial and\n\nnon-financial risks are included in the Risk Management chapter in the [Annual Report 2023.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk)\n\n## Specific Sustainability Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe potential risks (divided into threats and opportunities), mitigation measures, and net risks and opportunities of OMV activities, structured according to our material topics and related NaDiVeG concerns, are summarized in the table below. Materiality in this context is defined as issues having a potentially significant impact on the environment or society (for more information, see Materiality). Risks reported were selected based on their magnitude using impact and probability, and at least one relevant example for each material topic was selected.\n\n#### **Focus Area: Climate Change**\n\n| Material Topic<br>(NaDiVeG)                                  | Risk Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Effect Description<br>(Inside-Out or Outside-In)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Mitigation Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy Transition<br>(Environmental<br>concerns)             | Threat (Transition Risks):<br>Risk arising from the<br>organization's inability to<br>implement and manage new<br>technology and products to<br>reduce carbon intensity<br>impact, as well as the risk<br>caused by the delayed<br>implementation of a<br>low-carbon business due to<br>limited availability of critical<br>raw materials and/or<br>dependency on suppliers<br>within a competitive market.                                                      | Inside-Out:<br>OMV's total GHG carbon<br>footprint (Scopes 1, 2, 3) in<br>2023 amounted to 134 mn t<br>CO2 equivalent.

For OMV, a risk represents uncertainty regarding Company objectives measured by combining the likelihood or frequency of an event and its consequences, which can result in opportunities or threats to the success of the Company's sustainable business performance. 6\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Our sustainability framework and \"net zero by 2050\" target were the basis for developing the business strategy 2030 approved by the Executive and Supervisory Boards in December 2021. The Group's decarbonization strategy is overseen by Group Sustainability and Strategic Planning & Projects.\n\nOur climate ambitions are at the heart of our strategy, and responsibility for meeting these ambitions is embedded at the highest levels. Our Executive Board is responsible for setting our climate targets and ensuring that our Group's business strategy is aligned with meeting these targets. Correspondingly, meeting our climate change targets is a part of executive remuneration, with GHG reduction targets included in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and in the annual bonus paid to the Executive Board. Read more in Sustainability Governance.\n\nThe responsibility for our role in the energy transition is also entrenched at Supervisory Board level. In 2021, a Sustainability & Transformation Committee was established. Their purpose is to support the Company's Supervisory Board in\n\nreviewing and monitoring OMV's sustainability strategy, ESG-related standards, performance, and processes, and specifically our performance in HSSE and impact on climate change. Furthermore, the committee serves to support and oversee the transformation process toward a more sustainable business model, including the cultural integration of strategically significant acquisitions. For example, one of their responsibilities is to review and evaluate the progress we are making toward OMV's objectives in relation to our carbon footprint, climate change, and the energy transition.\n\nAt Group level, responsibility for GHG accounting and management, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability team in Investor Relations & Sustainability, an area overseen by the CFO. OMV's Group Sustainability department is responsible for generating OMV's GHG inventory based on international standards and best practice. This team coordinates activities throughout the business, providing guidance to stakeholder groups such as subsidiaries, business units, and assets on GHG and energy-related topics. Low- and zerocarbon products enabling the energy transition are developed in the business units. Support for carbon impact assessments for new products is provided at Group level by the Group Sustainability department.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nconsistency across the Group, there are also dedicated teams in OMV Petrom and Borealis.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team developed a Group-wide GHG Management Framework in 2022. This OMV Group regulation defines how to measure, report, and manage greenhouse gas emissions and contains the definitions, boundaries, and rules for the OMV Group's strategic GHG reduction targets and \"net zero by 2050\" ambition. It also defines the requirements for purchasing voluntary carbon offsets and their contribution to achieving the Group's GHG target.\n\nThe OMV Group's Capital Allocation Framework includes a strategic scoring methodology for investment projects based on four pillars: business strategic targets, financial metrics, risk profile, and climate targets impact. This new methodology was tested in 2022 in a pilot phase. The scoring helps to objectively define and review OMV's most important strategic projects and allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support our strategy delivery, including our GHG reduction path. Climate scoring is an integral part of this overall scoring and covers the investment's impact on the OMV Group's Scope 1, 2, and 3 climate targets for 2030, as well as EU taxonomy relevance.\n\nAs part of the updated Capital Allocation Framework, OMV also introduced a new definition for \"sustainability CAPEX,\" which encompasses investments that meet one of two criteria: either they are aligned with the EU taxonomy or they are investments that support the implementation of OMV's 2030 Sustainability Framework. The goal of the new Capital Allocation Framework is to promote and facilitate investments in projects aligned with our climate targets, including our long-term net-zero target, rather than traditional fossil fuel-related investments. For more information, see Sustainability Governance.\n\n## Collaboration with Start-ups and Research Institutions\n\nEmissions reduction and sustainable energy solutions play a major role in our transformational path to meet society's energy needs. The OMV Group is leveraging its existing expertise and collaborating with start-ups and research institutions to find innovative technological solutions that will drive the energy transition and pave the way to becoming a net-zero company by 2050. Innovation is a key element in OMV's implementation of its Strategy 2030 and critical to the transformation of the value chain from a linear to a circular model. OMV is always looking for innovative solutions to optimize operations, evaluate business opportunities, and develop new business models to make OMV a sustainable company.\n\nThe complexities of the competing demand between climate action and the continued demand for energy highlights the importance of investment in innovation and technological advancement. Investments in unlimited, lowcarbon geothermal energy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and renewable power solutions play a key role in OMV's Strategy 2030. In 2023, the OMV Group entered into several partnerships, which include the following:\n\n- OMV acquired a 6.5% stake in the privately owned Canadian company Eavor Technologies Inc. Eavor is the world's leading developer of closed-loop geothermal energy solutions. In addition, OMV and Eavor entered into a commercial agreement to pursue large-scale deployments of the Eavor-Loop™ technology in Europe and beyond.

As a core element of the collaboration, OMV is actively engaged in Plug and Play's innovation program, which offers a structured and efficient pathway to discover, evaluate, and invest in a selected group of promising start-ups.\n- For the past four years, OMV has been part of the \"VERBUND X Accelerator.\" In 2023, OMV was a community partner, which gave the Company access to a vast network of idea generators and thought pioneers. This collaboration offered the opportunity to engage with start-ups and benefit from the innovative potential of the community. As part of the VERBUND X Accelerator program, OMV entered a strategic collaboration with the American start-up Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) in 2022. As a technology leader in separation solutions for low-carbon intensity processes, CMS has developed a potentially groundbreaking technology for carbon capture. Following an intensive research and testing phase, OMV will implement the technology and test it on an industrial scale.\n- OMV announced research funding of approximately USD 6 mn to research teams at Stanford University for the next five years. The funding builds on ten years of existing cooperation with the institute, marking a significant step forward for OMV in spearheading the creation of AI-driven tools aimed at ideating sustainable solutions. Among the notable achievements of this support is the development of a smart AI-based decision-making tool to optimize developments in the low-carbon business areas. It is capable of not only strategically positioning CO2 injectors, but also selecting the most effective monitoring techniques. This innovation is key in ensuring the highest level of safety in long-term CO2 storage.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons.

The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- OMV started a collaboration with Hycamite, a Finnish start-up and a leader in emission-free pyrolysis technology. Through this collaboration, OMV will have access to a technology that will significantly aid the transition from our traditional business approach to a lower-carbon business model. The Hycamite technology breaks methane down into its component elements, hydrogen and carbon, without releasing any greenhouse gas emissions.\n- OMV developed and tested innovative technologies for Carbon Capture (CC), which will be tested in a pilot project in 2024. Together with Brusche Process Technology, a Dutch specialist in the design and construction of innovative sustainable process plants, a mobile carbon capture pilot plant is being built with the aim of testing these promising technologies for future application on a large scale at various OMV sites.\n\n## Low- and Zero-Carbon Products\n\nThe scale-up of zero-carbon and renewable energy product sales while reducing fossil fuel sales is central to reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply. Zero-carbon and renewable energy products include biofuels, electricity, waste heat, and new energy products such as geothermal heat.\n\nIn our Energy division, the Low Carbon Business (LCB) team has been working on expanding our photovoltaic asset base. Based on our subsurface knowledge, capabilities, and asset base, we have also been exploring carbon capture and storage solutions. We collaborate with industry and research partners on these activities in line with applicable regulatory and legal requirements. We are also investigating solutions for subsurface energy storage, e.g., with hydrogen, and looking at options to explore and commercially develop geothermal energy potential in the countries where we operate. These projects are mainly in the R&D or initial investment phase.\n\nIn F&F, we are contributing to the creation of a sustainable energy system by identifying and maturing solutions, with a strong focus on markets that are hard to electrify using batteries and customer segments such as heavy road transport or air travel. What these markets have in common is that they need an energy-dense yet climatefriendly fuel with the lowest possible downtime. Our portfolio focuses on waste-based and advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and e-fuels, as these offer the potential to utilize synergies with existing refinery assets and competences for a feasible scale-up and roll-out of green technologies.\n\nThe successful implementation of all these projects will reduce our absolute emissions, create green, innovative products and services for society, and provide a key differentiator for OMV.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has defined sustainability criteria that influence which projects and technologies are selected for investment. For all investments and M&A activities, it should be ensured that all climate-related risks are identified, assessed, and evaluated. This will include the assessment of the actual and forecast carbon footprint of the respective investment and M&A. Projects that contribute positively to the achievement of OMV's climate targets are preferred for investment (for more details, see Sustainability Governance). All project ideas selected for maturing need to demonstrate a feasible trajectory from pilot and demo stage to full industrial scale in the medium term.\n\n#### **Responsible Biofuels Sourcing**\n\nAll biofuels purchased by OMV in 2023 and used for blending meet the requirements of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Since 2013, the ISCC EU certificate issued for OMV Downstream GmbH has been renewed on an annual basis. OMV Petrom, OMV Hungary, OMV Czech Republic, OMV Germany, and OMV Slovakia are also certified according to the ISCC EU standard.\n\n#### **Biofuel Volumes**13\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/14 description: The image is a bar graph comparing the production of FAME, Ethanol, and HVO in megaliters for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2021, the production of FAME was 409 megaliters, while in 2022 and 2023, it was 351 megaliters. The production of Ethanol was 137 megaliters in 2021 and 2022, and 163 megaliters in 2023, while the production of HVO was 14 megaliters in 2021 and 2022, and 30 megaliters in 2023.\n\nOMV purchases biofuels mainly from European producers and excludes palm oil as a feedstock. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards require that no deforestation took place from January 2008 onward for any feedstock that is used for biodiesel generation. Since July 2021, OMV has also complied with the Austrian legal requirement not to use palm-oil-based biofuels for target fulfillment. In 2023, of all biofuels placed on the market by OMV, only around 0.3% were based on palm oil. The main feedstocks used are used cooking oil (30%), rapeseed oil (29%), and corn (13%).\n\nOMV plans to use vegetable oils and used cooking oil as well as other potential waste and advanced feedstock to produce biofuels using our Co-Processing technology. Co-Processing involves introducing biogenic feedstock during the fuel refining process instead of the conventional method of blending biogenic components into fuel after production.\n\n2023 figure estimated as both Austria and Germany data are based on year-to-date actuals plus a forecast for the remaining months each year, given that the annual deadline for closing all biofuel balances of a given year is not before the publication of the Sustainability Report. 13\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/1 description: The image contains three icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- The fourth quarter of 2023 was the first period when the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the world's first carbon border tax, entered into force in the European Union. The transitional phase started on October 1, 2023, and applies initially to imports of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. The CBAM was designed to level the playing field between EU and third-country producers by putting a carbon price on certain imported products, while phasing out free allocation of emissions allowances to European industry. In the first phase, the CBAM is only about reporting but not yet about paying a CO2 price.56\n## Public Policy\n\nOMV's public policy engagement is fully committed to the Business Strategy 2030, which is based on the Paris Agreement and aim to reach a net zero target in all three scopes by 2050 at the latest. We recognize that the regulatory framework can help achieve progress on issues such as resource efficiency, which includes reducing waste and marine litter thanks to the implementation of a circular economy, climate change, safety improvements, and fair trade. Interaction with governments and regulators takes place at international, European, national, and local levels. Regulators, political stakeholders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can all shape the regulatory framework that affects the Group's business. Therefore, the OMV Group needs to understand the policy, regulatory, and NGO environment and ensure that it can contribute its knowledge and insight to discussions regarding the future of the regulatory framework.\n\nThe OMV Group is a member of industry associations that support the understanding of issues, share knowledge, help develop standards, and provide input to regulatory authorities on behalf of the sector. OMV's association activities make an important contribution to the broader debate on a sustainable, affordable, and secure energy future, as well as sustainable chemicals and materials. Both the energy transition and the transformation from a linear to a circular economy can only succeed if all stakeholders, including legislators, businesses, and society, engage in productive debates. As a voice from the world of business, associations participate in precisely these important debates and contribute their proven expertise on various aspects of policy.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Direct Political Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group is active in economic policy but does not support political parties – neither financially nor in any other way. Donations to political parties are not permitted as per the Code of Business Ethics. Activities organized by political parties are not allowed on the premises of the OMV Group. There are no restrictions for individual OMV employees on engaging in political or public functions or engaging with special interest groups within the framework of legitimate secondary employment. However, it is not permitted to associate the OMV Group with such activities. As with other secondary employment, employees must conclude an agreement with OMV that regulates the details of such activities. Employees must disclose a conflict of interest between the exercising of political or other public functions and their employment with the OMV Group to their line manager and to Compliance.\n\n#### **Indirect Political Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group exchanges views on regulatory issues with the responsible political decision-maker(s) and actively participates in EU and national public consultations on legislative initiatives that are relevant to the Group's business. It is an active member of industry associations and standardization groups at international, EU, and national levels to stay at the forefront of regulatory and public requirements. The OMV Group representatives make OMV's position clear on the issues tackled by the associations of which we are members. It aims to inform EU policies by engaging with major industry associations such as Fuels Europe, the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), Plastics Europe, and the Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform (PCEP).\n\n#### **Transparency**\n\nOur practices are fully in line with all reporting obligations at national and EU levels, and we are fully compliant with all transparency requirements. Interaction with governments and regulators takes place at international, European, national, and local levels.\n\n#### **Monitoring Participation in Industry Associations**\n\nAssociations aim to adopt positions that reflect a consensus view among members, and thus may not always reflect the view of each individual member. We continuously monitor our membership of associations and their positions on issues so we can consider whether our memberships remain appropriate. As part of our commitment to transparency on climate action, we report not only on our own position and action on climate change, but also on the position of the key industry associations of which we are a member. The OMV Group also regularly reports on the alignment between the industry associations of which we are a member, including OMV's position on climate change policies. Read our latest review [here](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522202741166/dload_OMVs%20Industry%20Association%20Memberships%20Update2021_EN).\n\nIn cases of misalignment, particularly partial misalignment, we will first advocate for changes to the association's position. Where OMV and an association's position\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house. The icon is likely used to represent home or a similar concept.\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ncontinues to fail to align, especially in cases of complete misalignment, we will reassess our membership. The OMV Group plans to regularly publish an update on its industry associations review and to expand the scope of review further.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n- In 2023, the finalization of the Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU were among the most relevant regulatory issues for the OMV Group in the EU. The former included dossiers like the Renewable Energy Directive III, the EU Emissions Trading System, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the Energy Efficiency Directive, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. The OMV Group monitored the legal development and contributed to the positioning of the industry associations. A new topic that came up in 2023 was the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The OMV Group focused particularly on the Net-Zero Industry Act in the context of this package.\n- The hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package and the methane emissions regulation are currently being discussed and were due to be finalized by the end of 2023. The REMIT II Regulation came up as a new topic and is also under review. With regards to the security of gas supply, the Austrian preventive action plan was updated in the reporting year and the EU Energy Platform (AggregateEU) was still an ongoing project with participation from OMV's side.\n- The OMV Group also monitored the development and contributed to industry association positions on several ongoing negotiations in the area of implementing the Circular Economy Action Plan. Negotiations are ongoing as regards several key files, including the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, the Endof-Life Vehicles Regulation, the Waste Shipment Regulation, and discussions on a global instrument to end plastic pollution.\n- Sustainable finance legislation, including the EU taxonomy, was also on the agenda and the OMV Group participated in the relevant working groups at industry associations.\n- In 2023, the European Chemicals Agency put forward a proposal to restrict the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the EU. The OMV Group supported the detailed analyses conducted by associations in this regard.\n- Among the associations' governing boards and task forces, OMV Petrom continued to promote and advocate for a stronger and express commitment and similar initiatives to the targets of the Paris Agreement. Consequently, FIC and ARPEE have elaborated a dedicated stance on the matter. Alongside these endeavors, OMV Petrom committed its expertise and resources to extending the scope of activity of FPPG, with the aim of promoting green technologies (geothermal energy, carbon capture, transport and storage, hydrogen, photovoltaics, biofuels, and biomethane) and ensuring their successful deployment in Romania by shaping a common vision of their demand and benefits. OMV Petrom is thereby contributing to the understanding of the economic and environmental reasoning and implications and raising awareness of the existing bottlenecks among all concerned stakeholders.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, the European Green Deal, the 2040 climate targets, and initiatives regarding the circular economy will be the most relevant regulatory packages for the OMV Group in the EU. The OMV Group will also follow any developments with regards to the European Carbon Management Strategy, and the upcoming European elections in 2024. Likewise, the OMV Group will closely monitor upcoming public consultations.\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine and current developments in the Middle East might continue to trigger unpredictable developments, which will require flexible solutions. As an important pillar for more sustainable energy, the OMV Group will continuously analyze and engage in projects that contribute to accelerating the clean energy transition and circular economy – as well as the regulatory framework of such projects. With regards to the security of gas supply, the focus will remain on the Austrian preventive action plan and the EU Energy Platform (AggregateEU).\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/0 description: The image shows a simple, circular icon of a house.

In the upper left corner is the number 17 in white. To the right of the number is the text \"PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\" in white. Below the number and text is a white graphic of five overlapping circles.\n\nImplementing sustainable procurement means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the goods and services the Company intends to purchase. At OMV, we aim to foster innovation, maximize value contribution, and enable supply chain growth. We achieve this by applying our sourcing and logistics expertise to ensure that the highest-quality materials and services are provided throughout our supply chain. This involves working closely with our partners, contractors, and suppliers. It is of paramount importance to our organization to be fully compliant with all applicable legal requirements, as well as with our internal safety, environmental protection, and human rights standards when managing our supply chain. By integrating sustainability requirements throughout our supply chain (e.g., audits, assessments, sustainability criteria in sourcing) we aim to drive a positive change in the sustainability performance of our suppliers and contractors while mitigating potential negative impacts such as economic disturbance due to delays in payment. Our purchased goods and services are for all our business areas (Chemicals & Materials, Energy, and Fuels & Feedstock) and include, among others, those related to raw materials, wells, IT, consultancy, engineering, logistics, and retail.\n\n## Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nTo mitigate supply chain risks, including forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and corruption, the OMV Group imposes the legal requirements and internal rules and standards applicable to OMV on its suppliers. Our suppliers are obligated to fully comply with the content of the OMV Code of Conduct, and our supply chain partners are\n\nrequired to sign the OMV Code of Conduct. In addition, our suppliers must accept the OMV General Conditions of Purchase, which further detail our business standards (e.g., labor rights), as an integral part of our contractual agreements. OMV reserves the right to terminate relationships with suppliers if non-compliance with applicable policies is discovered or if non-compliance is not addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOMV's Corporate Procurement Directive was revised in 2023. Two of the main changes were the introduction of sustainability criteria as part of the commercial evaluation and sustainability embedded in the Supplier Relationship Management process. To ensure we have a standardized approach to payment conditions for our suppliers and contractors, we have 60-day standard payment terms stipulated in the Corporate Procurement Directive.\n\n#### Governance\n\nOMV Procurement is organized as an integrated function and covers day-to-day procurement activities across the entire OMV Group (including OMV Petrom and Borealis). OMV Procurement is led by the Chief Procurement Officer, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. From an organizational perspective, OMV Procurement is split into several Procurement Units that cover aspects such as Operations & Materials, Raw Materials & Packaging, and Retail & Business Services. A dedicated Sustainable Procurement & Supplier Innovation department established in April 2022 continued to work toward meeting the sustainable procurement ambitions and targets for 2025 and 2030.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing and is slightly thicker than the lines of the house. The icon is likely used to represent a home or a homepage on a website or app.\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n## Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\n#### **Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)**\n\nA new SRM framework was developed in 2022 and subsequently rolled out in 2023, with the focus on managing the strategic relationship with our suppliers and contractors. Thanks to the new SRM framework, sustainability is now part of supplier segmentation, supplier performance, supplier meetings, and supplier innovation.\n\nTo support the OMV Group on its transformation journey to become a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, materials, and the circular economy, it is crucial to ensure that suppliers are encouraged to innovate. This helps unlock their potential, and the innovative solutions they develop provide an opportunity to enhance and strengthen partnerships between the Company, Procurement, and suppliers.\n\n#### **Prequalification**\n\nSupplier prequalification is part of precontractual activities, during which OMV collects information from a potential supplier with the purpose of evaluating compliance with our HSSE and sustainability requirements. The goal of the prequalification process is to screen potential suppliers before bringing them on board to ensure that only those suppliers that meet our HSSE and sustainability standards can be considered for future collaboration.\n\nThe prequalification is based on a standardized list of elements and objectives that aligns with the OMV Group's HSSE Management System (e.g., HSSE Policy, ISO 9001, 14001, 45001) and our Sustainability Framework (e.g., Sustainability Policy, Human Rights Policy, and Grievance Mechanisms). At Borealis, especially for raw materials and packaging, suppliers located in a so-called \"high-risk\" country are asked to submit a positive Together for Sustainability (TfS) Audit and Assessment report. We categorize high-risk countries by considering human rights, environmental, and ethical aspects.\n\n#### **Supplier Selection**\n\nFollowing prequalification, Procurement and business representatives select the best suppliers based on a predefined set of commercial and technical criteria during a tender process. To support the overall OMV Group Sustainability Targets 2030 and the Sustainable Procurement ambition to give sustainability a \"value\" in sourcing, the Procurement department included two criteria to assess the sustainability performance of the bidders in their commercial evaluation: the EcoVadis score and participation in the CDP Supply Chain.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nUnderstanding a supplier's risk is an important factor in deciding whether and how we conduct business with the supplier. Since 2019, we have been receiving daily alerts about our registered suppliers through SAP Ariba. These enable us to monitor their risks in four categories: Environmental and Social, Finance, Regulatory and Legal, and Operations. These risk alerts help us apply a preventive risk management process. Furthermore, OMV has a screening process in place to ensure that parties sanctioned by the EU or international organizations, such as the United Nations, are not accepted as procurement partners.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nOMV conducts two types of audits of its suppliers and contractors: on-site Together for Sustainability audits that focus on the sustainability performance of a company, and remote full-scope audits performed by an external auditor. The audits are carried out as part of the prequalification process and/or during contract execution. The aim of the audits is to measure the performance of our suppliers and define actions that will enable them to optimize their performance and meet OMV requirements. During the fullscope audits, we pay special attention to the financial stability of our suppliers, their strategy and organization, supply chain, sustainability (e.g., social and environmental issues), and their cybersecurity performance.\n\nEach audit finding classified with a red flag is followed up and analyzed by the Procurement team in collaboration with business representatives and any other relevant function (e.g., HSSE, Legal, Internal auditing, and Compliance). Information on the outcome of the audit is made available to the supplier, and the supplier is requested to submit a proposed corrective plan with concrete measures and an implementation timeline. In 2023, 22 audits resulted in follow-up measures.\n\n#### **Together for Sustainability (TfS)**\n\nSince 2021, OMV has been a member of Together for Sustainability (TfS). As a joint initiative and global network of 50 companies, TfS sets the de facto global standard for the environmental, social, and governance performance of chemical supply chains. The TfS program is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care®. Being a TfS member helps OMV further embed sustainability into its day-to-day business operations and further cascade sustainability requirements within our supply chain.\n\nThe OMV Procurement department has defined TfS-related targets for 2025 and 2030:\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/0 description: The image shows a simple icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a basic outline with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle around the house is also a simple outline. The color of both the house and the circle is a light blue. \n\nImage /page/150/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside of a circle. The second and third icons are left and right facing arrows inside of circles, respectively. \n\n- By 2025, we aim to run sustainability evaluations (TfS Audits57 and TfS Assessments58) for all suppliers covering >80% of the Procurement spend.\n- By 2030, we aim to extend sustainability evaluations (i.e., TfS Audits and TfS Assessments) to all suppliers covering 90% of the Procurement spend.\n\n#### **Supply Chain Carbon Transparency**\n\nWe aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon volume of our purchased goods and services. OMV is fully committed to climate change mitigation and responsible resource management. Only by working together with our suppliers will we be able to define joint low-carbon initiatives to continuously decrease the carbon emissions in the supply chain and meet our Paris Agreement commitments.\n\nAs part of its CDP Supply Chain membership, in 2023 OMV invited 394 suppliers to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire. Suppliers were selected based on spend, estimated carbon emissions volume, and the carbon intensity of the goods and services purchased from them. In addition to reporting their emissions, we asked the suppliers whether they have carbon reduction targets in place and invited them to share with us any initiatives or projects to reduce carbon emissions in which they would like us to participate.\n\n#### **Supplier Capacity Building**\n\nOMV works together with its suppliers to improve overall sustainability performance. For instance, in 2023, individual meetings and webinars were offered to our suppliers to help them better understand the requirements of the CDP climate change questionnaire or the TfS Assessment, and why this information is important to OMV. Additionally, the topics of sustainable and low-carbon procurement were also included in the agenda of our annual strategic supplier meetings (e.g., Innovation – How can we create sustainable value through innovation? Climate Change – How can we build successful alliances on the path to net zero? Circular Economy – How can we collaborate to effectively implement circular solutions?).\n\n#### **Local Content**\n\nWe aim to support the local communities in the locations where we operate by fostering economic development. Local procurement strengthens the local economy and meets the local procurement expectations of neighboring communities. Increased local procurement has had the added benefit of reducing business disruption in recent years, as well as the potential for a lower carbon footprint from the reduced transportation distance of the goods purchased. The spend with local suppliers in 2023 at Group level was 71.2%.\n\n## 2023 Actions\n\n**40** remote full-scope audits performed by OMV Procurement with an external auditor\n\n- **224** TfS (Re)Assessments performed by EcoVadis\n**303** suppliers with a valid EcoVadis score (no more than 3 years old)\n\n**57%** of suppliers with improved EcoVadis score\n\n**8** TfS Audits performed in 2023\n\n**73** OMV suppliers have completed at least one sustainability training on the EcoVadis platform\n\n**394** suppliers invited to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire (vs. **231** in 2022)\n\n**205** buyers across all locations attended awareness sessions on sustainable procurement (**76%** of buyers)\n\n**1,022** new suppliers screened for social criteria (e.g., child labor, forced labor, and collective bargaining) and environmental criteria\n\n**71.2%** local spend value across the OMV Group (**89.6%** local spend value in Austria, **81.4%** in Belgium, **99.1%** in Romania)\n\nIn 2023, we actively engaged not only with our suppliers, but also with buyers on sustainable procurement and supplier innovation practices. 205 buyers from OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis participated in several awareness sessions throughout the year. The focus was on engaging buyers on sustainable procurement, supplier relationship management, and supplier innovation.\n\nIn October 2023, we organized the second Supplier Sustainability and Innovation Day, with the aim of interacting and exchanging experiences with our suppliers and having the opportunity to build a stronger and more sustainable supply chain. More than 350 participants from the suppliers' side and the OMV Group attended the event. Together with our suppliers, we addressed topics such as climate change, the circular economy, and innovation (e.g., Climate Change – How can we build successful alliances on the path to net zero? Circular Economy – How can we collaborate to effectively implement circular solutions? Innovation – How can we create sustainable value through innovation?). The key presenters from OMV Group included OMV Group CFO, CEO of OMV Petrom, CEO of Borealis, OMV Group SVP of Innovation & Technology, and OMV Group SVP of Procurement.\n\nTfS Audits are conducted by an approved external auditor and can be on site, remote, or a hybrid of the two. They cover a single or combined business location such as a production site or warehouse. Sustainability performance is verified against a defined set of audit criteria. 57\n\nTfS Assessments are conducted by TfS partner and service provider EcoVadis, a global leader in CSR assessments, via a secure online platform. The assessment questionnaire is adapted to the size, country of origin, and business sector of the company being assessed and results in a score at the end (the EcoVadis score). 58\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Our three focus areas for the future will be:\n\n- Sustainable suppliers (e.g., only suppliers who meet OMV's sustainability requirements will be eligible to participate in tenders)\n- Sustainable sourcing (e.g., we will aim to integrate sustainability criteria into award decisions, such as CO2 emissions per kg product)\n- Low-carbon procurement (e.g., we will aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon volume of purchased goods and services)\n\n| Targets 2025       | Be an active member of TfS and conduct sustainability eval-                     uations of all suppliers covering >80% of Procurement                     spend59 Engage with suppliers covering 80% of Procurement spend                     and assess their carbon footprint as a foundation from                     which to define and run joint low-carbon initiatives |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Targets 2030       | Extend sustainability evaluations to suppliers covering 90%                     of Procurement spend All suppliers covering >80% of Procurement spend to have                     carbon reduction targets in place                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Status 2023        | 40.6% of A suppliers (suppliers covering >80% of Procure-                     ment spend) assessed 394 suppliers engaged with via CDP (vs. 231 in 2022) 71% of responding suppliers have a climate target in place                     (vs. 75% in 2022)60                                                                                                                    |\n| Most relevant SDGs |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**8.3** Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services\n\n**8.7** Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking, and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labor in all its forms\n\n**8.8** Protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment\n\n**13.1** Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries\n\n**16.5** Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms\n\nSuppliers covering 80% of Procurement spend are classed by OMV as A suppliers. We plan to increase the number of A suppliers engaged annually to 100% by 2025. The number of suppliers with climate change targets in place is slightly lower compared to the previous year due to the fact that in 2023 we engaged more companies that are small- and medium-size enterprises and are only at the beginning of their sustainability journey. 59 60\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Performance in Detail\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **EU Taxonomy Data**\n- **Economic Data**\n- **Safety Data**\n- **Environmental Data**\n- **Workforce Data**\n- **OMV AG Data**\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/153/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons.

The Company applies the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB) and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") as reporting criteria. In addition, the company prepares disclosures in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which are published as part of sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for the selection and application of appropriate methods for non-financial reporting (especially the selection of significant matters) as well as the use of appropriate assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures, given\n\nthe circumstances. Furthermore, their responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of systems, processes and internal controls that are relevant for the preparation of the sustainability report in a way that is free of material misstatements – whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to state whether, based on our procedures performed and the evidence we have obtained, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company's NFI report is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB), the legal requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") in all material respects.\n\nOur engagement was conducted in conformity with Austrian Standards for Independent Assurance Engagements (KFS/PG 13) and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) applicable to such engagements. These standards require us to comply with our professional requirements including independence requirements, and to plan and perform the engagement to enable us to express a conclusion with limited assurance, taking into account materiality.\n\nAn independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with limited assurance (\"limited assurance engagement\") is substantially less in scope than an independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with reasonable assurance (\"reasonable assurance engagement\"), thus providing reduced assurance. Despite diligent engagement planning and execution, it cannot be ruled out that material misstatements, illegal acts or irregularities within the nonfinancial report will remain undetected.\n\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment and included the following procedures in particular:\n\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for the materiality analysis, in order to gain an understanding of the processes for determining material sustainability topics and respective reporting threshholds of the Company;\n- A risk assessment, including a media analysis, on relevant information on the Company's sustainability performance in the reporting period;\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of disclosures on environmental, social and employee-related matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption as well as bribery and also includes the consolidation of data;\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for providing, consolidating and implementing internal control procedures relating to the disclosure of concepts, risks, due diligence processes, results and performance indicators;\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents, in order to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;\n- Assessment of the processes for local data collection, validation and reporting, as well as the reliability of the reported data through a survey performed at sites on a sample basis;\n- Analytical evaluation of the data and trend of quantitative disclosures regarding the GRI Standards listed in the GRI-Index, submitted by all locations for consolidation at the group level;\n- Evaluation of the consistency of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB), the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") to disclosures and indicators of the NFI report, which apply to the Company;\n- Evaluation of the overall presentation of the disclosures by critically reading the NFI report.\n\nThe procedures that we performed do not constitute an audit or a review. Our engagement did not focus on\n\nrevealing and clarifying of illegal acts (such as fraud), nor did it focus on assessing the efficiency of management. Furthermore, it is not part of our engagement to audit future-related disclosures, prior year figures, statements from external sources of information, expert opinions or references to more extensive external reporting formats of the Company.\n\n## Restriction on use\n\nBecause our report will be prepared solely on behalf of and for the benefit of the principal, its contents may not be relied upon by any third party, and consequently, we shall not be liable for any third party claims. We agree to the publication of our assurance certificate and NFI report. However, publication may only be performed in its entirety and as a version has been certified by us.\n\n## General Conditions of Contract\n\nOur responsibility and liability towards the Company and any third party is subject to paragraph 7 of the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions.\n\nVienna\n\n12 March 2024\n\nKPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\nMag.

The 2023 Report describes our management and performance of the material Environmental, Social, and Governance issues for the OMV Group. This Report covers the operations of the OMV Group, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, for the 2023 business year.\n\nThis Report is the combined, consolidated, non-financial report of the OMV Group in line with the Austrian Nachhaltigkeits- und Diversitätsverbesserungsgesetz (Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act; NaDiVeG), namely in accordance with Section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code. In line with NaDiVeG's reporting requirements (Section 243b), data particularly relevant for OMV Aktiengesellschaft is reported separately in the Performance in Detail section under OMV AG Data.\n\nOMV's 2023 Sustainability Report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, applying the GRI Oil and Gas Sector Standard 2021. The Report is also guided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production industry, the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the \"Sustainability reporting guidance for the oil and gas industry\" developed by Ipieca, API, and IOGP. Reporting on OMV's alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been informed by the Business Reporting on the SDGs published by the GRI and the UN Global Compact (UNGC). The document also serves as our Communication on Progress for the UNGC.\n\n## Report Scope and Boundaries\n\nThe data presented in the Report is consolidated at Group level and covers all fully consolidated entities, analogous to the Company's financial statements. This boundary applies to all material topics, unless clearly indicated otherwise for a particular material topic in the text of this Sustainability Report. Where an entity is not included in the reporting, it is denoted in a footnote. All of the Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) data, including greenhouse gas (GHG) data for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions, is collected for activities where OMV is the operator or where OMV has a stake of more than 50% and exerts a controlling influence (operational approach).<sup>1</sup> Where data has been restated due to changes in calculation methodology or error, this has been denoted in a footnote.\n\n## Assurance and Approval\n\nThe Sustainability Report is approved by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the OMV Group. OMV's Sustainability Report 2023 was subject to independent and external limited assurance by KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, and was discussed extensively by the Audit Committee, the Sustainability & Transformation Committee, and the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board found no issues during the audit and are responsible for the final approval of this Report. The independent assurance (limited assurance) was performed in accordance with the requirements of the ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard issued by the International Federation of Accountants, and in conformity with Austrian Standards for Independent Assurance Engagements (KFS/PG 13). More information about OMV can be found in the [OMV Annual Report 2023](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023), in the [OMV Factbook,](https://www.omv.com/en/investor-relations/publications#factbook) and on our website: [www.omv.com](https://www.omv.com/en)\n\nFor Scope 3 categories 10, 11, and 12, the operational control approach is applied. For example, in OMV's Energy division, when an OMV Group company participates in joint operations, and is fully consolidated, 100% of the respective OMV Group company sales are accounted, however, this value usually only represents the OMV Group's share in the joint operation. 1\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Sustainability at OMV\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **Foreword**\n- **Highlights 2023**\n- **OMV at a Glance**\n- **Sustainability Framework**\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/1 description: The image shows three circular icons.

What did you mean by that?**\n\nThe European Union (EU) Green Deal recognizes that there is no single solution to addressing climate change. To achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a substantial collective effort will be required from every sector. Our strategy acknowledges this interconnectedness and interdependency. We therefore aim to re-invent essentials for sustainable living, not only in a way that aligns with our targets, but also that delivers comparable benefits to our stakeholders. This is the systematic change I was referring to – we all have our role to play on this journey. For transformative change to occur in our society, collaboration, technology, and innovation will be crucial.\n\nIn 2023, OMV continued to form strategic partnerships and alliances. For instance, we partnered with Interzero to build one of Europe's largest waste sorting plants. It will provide circular and sustainable feedstock for chemical recycling using our patented ReOil® technology. The feedstock produced will then be transformed into a high-quality raw material that is certified according to the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification, or ISCC. Customers who utilize this raw material as feedstock for sustainable plastic production will gain improved insights into the carbon footprint of the products they make. To ensure that our patented technology also benefits other stakeholders, we signed a mutually exclusive collaboration agreement with Wood for its commercial licensing on a global scale. The licensees will also benefit from full asset life cycle support.\n\n### **Can you comment on some of the measures OMV is implementing to actively reduce its direct and indirect emissions, especially the challenging Scope 3 emissions?**\n\nTo actively reduce our direct emissions at ongoing operations in Austria and Romania, we have started using renewable energy generated by our solar parks. For instance, the PV plants located at the Lobau tank farm and Schönkirchen together generated more than 20 GWh of renewable energy in 2023, which was used for our ongoing operations.\n\nTo reduce our Scope 2 emissions, we signed several power purchase agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy supply for many years to come. As an example, the clean wind energy acquired through the PPA with WEB Windenergie AG will be used to produce green hydrogen at the Schwechat refinery. Through the projects we have implemented, we have been able to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% and the carbon intensity of our operations by 20% compared with the base year 2019.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/12 description: A portrait of a man in a suit and tie. He has gray hair and a beard, and he is wearing glasses. He is standing in front of a white background. He is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a blue tie. There is a small pin on his lapel.\n\n## \"Prioritizing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and stakeholders will always be paramount for us.\"\n\nReducing Scope 3 emissions is a key challenge for many sectors, underscoring the need for holistic solutions. For instance, to address Scope 3.11 emissions linked to the sustainable feedstock we supply, we have initiated Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs offer insights into a product's CO2 emissions and guide optimization measures to achieve further reductions. For example, the LCA we commissioned for our ReOil® technology demonstrated\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/1 description: This image contains text describing the advantages of the circular economy. By 2030, 34% of CO2e emissions could be saved if waste streams currently destined for incineration are chemically recycled using the ReOil technology.\n\nThese are only a few examples of the projects have been implemented. Individually, the annual CO2 savings they achieve may not seem significant at first glance, but when combined, they present a different picture. We have also made significant investments to reduce the carbon footprint of our portfolio. In 2023, OMV and Wien Energie formed a joint venture called \"deeep\" to work on decarbonizing district heating in Vienna by providing geothermal energy as an alternative. In Romania, OMV Petrom and Complexul Energetic Oltenia joined forces to build four PV parks with a combined capacity of 450 MW. They will supply electricity to the national grid from 2025. In Norway, with our partner Aker BP, we completed the acquisition of a 3D seismic survey of the Poseidon CCS license area. Our collaborations with start-ups, universities, and technology leaders around the world thrived, emphasizing our pursuit of innovative solutions to reduce emissions and advance sustainable energy development.\n\n#### **In 2021, OMV made a commitment to the Just Transition. What progress has been made so far?**\n\nIntegrating climate change and the Just Transition into our Group's Human Rights Policy Statement was the first essential step. We simultaneously prioritized training for our employees, ensuring they are well-prepared for future job roles that emerge as a result of our strategy. To enable our workforce to cultivate a mindset aligned with our journey to net zero, we also introduced the Sustainability Academy. It provides an essential foundation for various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics, the circular economy, low-carbon technologies, and others. More specialized training was offered to employees already involved in implementing our strategy. For instance, employees that were previously working in the exploration department in our Energy segment were upskilled to equip them with the specific skill set necessary for developing geothermal reservoirs.\n\nIn 2023, we spent more than EUR 12 mn on training employees and I am proud to say that we have already achieved our 2030 target of increasing the average number of annual learning hours to at least 30 hours per employee.\n\n### **Health & Safety has always been an important topic for you. Unfortunately, the incidents and injuries reported have seen a rise over the past two years.**\n\nIt is always disheartening to witness a reversing trend. No matter how many impressive results we achieve, if it is at the expense of our employee and contractors' well-being, this can only imply a collective failure to meet our HSSE\n\nVision of being \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\"\n\nPrioritizing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and stakeholders will always be paramount for us. We are actively reassessing our safety measures and have a renewed commitment to implementing effective strategies to slow and reverse this trend. Initiatives like \"We CARE,\" \"BACK to BASICS,\" and \"B-SAFE\" across different parts of the Group have begun to yield positive results. With our updated HSSE strategy and a strong focus on safety culture, leadership, and contractor engagement, I am convinced that we will successfully resume our journey toward becoming an industry leader in safety.\n\n### **Mr. Stern, this is a very special edition of OMV's Sustainability Report. How would you describe OMV's sustainability journey over the past few years and what are your thoughts on the new reporting framework?**\n\nYes, this truly is a momentous occasion because it is the last stand-alone edition of our Sustainability Report. In recent years, our sustainability journey has demonstrated continuous improvement. In the last two years alone, we pinpointed numerous data and reporting gaps, achieving an impressive 25% improvement in disclosed data points between 2021 and 2022. This not only underscores our commitment to comprehensive and transparent reporting practices but also signifies the positioning of sustainability at the heart of our strategy.\n\nOur Sustainability Report has always catered to numerous stakeholder groups and provided substantial information that goes beyond what is typically included in the financial statement. The key challenge in the coming years will be to ensure that we strike a healthy balance between financial and non-financial reporting. The combined report should not merely become a reporting exercise but rather a tool that aids the assessment for positive transformation and to drive continuous improvement. Finally, the combined report will provide an excellent framework to balance our social responsibility on the one hand, and maintain our focus on delivering excellent financial performance on the other.\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and by extension the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, elevate sustainability to a level of prominence that has traditionally been reserved for finance. The clear emphasis is on a dual imperative – while businesses must pursue profitability, they are equally obligated to ensure that the adopted business practices reflect their social responsibilities as well. This highlights a paradigm shift toward a more balanced and responsible approach to OMV's success. I firmly believe that transformation and growth can only be achieved by embracing change and am looking forward to the further integration of sustainability into our business.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles.

In 2023, Group sales amounted to EUR 39 bn. With a year-end market capitalization of around EUR 13 bn, OMV is one of Austria's largest listed industrial companies. The majority of its roughly 20,600 employees work at its integrated European sites.\n\n## Our Purpose and Values\n\nOMV's purpose, \"Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living,\" is a fundamental part of our strategy for becoming a leading company in sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. It guides the Company like a North Star toward its goal of becoming a net-zero emissions company. To ensure this purpose is fully embraced, we have designed new values and behaviors that align with our new direction. Our new OMV Group values \"We care | We're curious | We progress\" were introduced in 2023 and will guide us on our path to a more sustainable future.\n\n### Our Business Segments\n\nIn Chemicals & Materials, OMV is one of the world's leading providers of advanced and circular polyolefin solutions, with total polyolefin sales of 5.7 mn t in 2023 (2022: 5.7 mn t). It is also a European market leader in base chemicals and plastics recycling. The Company supplies services and products to customers worldwide through OMV and Borealis<sup>2</sup>, and its two joint ventures: Borouge (with\n\nADNOC, based in the UAE and Singapore) and Baystar™ (with TotalEnergies, based in the US).\n\nIn Fuels & Feedstock, OMV operates three refineries in Europe: Schwechat (Austria) and Burghausen (Germany), both of which feature integrated petrochemical production, and the Petrobrazi refinery (Romania). In addition, OMV holds a 15% share in ADNOC Refining and in ADNOC Global Trading in the UAE. OMV's total global processing capacity amounts to around 500 kbbl/d. Fuels and other sales volumes in Europe were 16.3 mn t in 2023 (2022: 15.5 mn t) and the retail network consisted at the end of 2023 of 1,666 filling stations (2022: 1,803) in eight European countries.\n\nIn Energy, OMV explores, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas in its three core regions of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the North Sea. OMV is currently in the process of divesting its E&P assets in the Asia-Pacific region.<sup>3</sup> Its activities also include the low carbon business and the entire gas business. Daily hydrocarbon production was 364 kboe/d in 2023 (2022: 392 kboe/d), with a nearly equal share of liquids and natural gas production. In the Gas Marketing & Power business, OMV markets and trades natural gas and power in several European countries, which also includes its LNG business. It holds a 65% stake in the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) and operates natural gas storage facilities with a capacity of around 30 TWh in Austria and Germany, and a gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\nOMV announced in July 2023 that it had decided to pursue negotiations with ADNOC on a potential cooperation regarding their polyolefins businesses. Such cooperation would include a potential combination of the Borealis and Borouge businesses as equal partners under a jointly controlled, listed platform for potential growth acquisitions to create a global polyolefins company with a material presence in key markets. 2\n\n<sup>3</sup> On January 31, 2024, OMV signed an agreement to divest its 50% shareholding in Malaysia's SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd. to TotalEnergies for an overall cash consideration of USD 903 mn. The divestment is anticipated to close around the end of the first half of 2024, and is in particular subject to regulatory approvals. The sales process for 100% of the shares in OMV New Zealand will continue separately.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Sustainability and circularity lie at the center of our Group strategy. We aim to become a netzero business by 2050, accelerate the energy transition, and proactively expedite the transition from a linear to a circular economy. We build positive relationships with our employees, communities, suppliers, and other stakeholders, including by addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\nOur Sustainability Framework is built around the three pillars Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). We have made the following commitments, which lie at the heart of our Sustainability Framework, to propel our ESG journey:\n\n#### Environmental:\n\n- OMV continuously improves the carbon efficiency of its operations and product portfolio, is fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, and aims to become a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner.\n- OMV is fully committed to acting on responsible natural resources management and will proactively expedite the transition from a linear to a circular economy.\n- OMV aims to minimize environmental impacts by preventing water and soil pollution, reducing emissions, using natural resources efficiently, and avoiding biodiversity disruption.\n\n#### Social:\n\n- Health, safety, and security have the highest priority in all activities, and OMV is fully committed to proactive risk management to realize its HSSE Vision: \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\"\n- OMV is committed to building and retaining a talented expert team for international and integrated growth, and we embrace our difference(s) and use our diversity of thought and experience as a catalyst for growth and creativity.\n- OMV is committed to ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees, and has zero tolerance for discrimination and sexual and nonsexual harassment.\n- As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, OMV is fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and aims to contribute to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by pursuing a social investment strategy that addresses local needs and the SDGs.\n- OMV is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities, and addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\n#### Governance:\n\n- OMV strives to uphold equally high ethical standards at all locations, and aims to earn stakeholders' confidence by implementing a high standard of corporate governance and by maintaining high standards of transparency and predictability.\n- OMV is committed to implementing sustainable procurement, which means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the services and goods the Company intends to purchase.\n\nOur Strategy 2030 is underpinned by this Sustainability Framework, with all business decisions guided by our ambition to become a net-zero business. Within our Sustainability Framework, we have established five strategic focus areas: Climate Change; Natural Resources Management; Health, Safety, and Security; People; and Ethical Business Practices. For each of these focus areas, we have formulated concrete targets and actions to be achieved by 2030. These serve as OMV's contribution to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our sustainability ambitions, especially getting to net zero, can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. The Group has earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn for the purpose of achieving our emissions reduction targets.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue outlined icon of a house inside of a blue circle.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons.

The check mark is in the center of the circle.\n\n#### **Target 2025**\n\nPromote awareness of ethical values and principles: conduct in-person or online business ethics training for all employees\n\n### **Key Actions:**\n\n- Screen all suppliers against mandatory ESG criteria during supplier prequalification\n- Foster the digital availability of compliance services and information, in particular by broadening the functions of the OMV Compliance app\n- Operate a state-of-the-art Compliance Management System (verified and approved according to IDW PS 980 standard in 2022)\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/14 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. The first icon, on the left, is for SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features the number 8 at the top, followed by the text \"DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\", and a graphic of a line graph with an upward trend over a bar graph. The background color is a dark red. The second icon, in the center, is for SDG 13: Climate Action. It features the number 13 at the top, followed by the text \"CLIMATE ACTION\", and a graphic of an eye with the earth inside. The background color is green. The third icon, on the right, is for SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. It features the number 16 at the top, followed by the text \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\", and a graphic of a dove holding an olive branch above a gavel. The background color is blue.\n\nFurther details and definitions for each target can be found in the respective Focus Areas sections of the report.\n\n## Sustainability Governance\n\nSustainability topics are fully integrated into the overall governance structure of the Company. These topics have the same weight as any other business consideration and, following the Company's responsible approach to business, are integrated into the daily operation and management processes of the Company. For instance, sustainability criteria form part of the Capital Allocation Framework (see Climate Change). ESG due diligence is also part of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n### Governance Structure\n\nOMV has a two-tier governance structure. The Executive Board, composed of the CEO, CFO, Executive Vice President (EVP) Chemicals & Materials, EVP Fuels & Feedstock, and EVP Energy, is the highest managing body of the Company and is responsible for setting and implementing the Company strategy, including climate and other sustainability targets. The Executive Board holds meetings at least every two weeks to exchange information and issue decisions on all matters requiring plenary approval.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is OMV's highest governing body and consists of ten members elected at the Annual General Meeting (shareholders' representatives) and five members delegated by the Group's Works Council. All members elected at the Annual\n\nGeneral Meeting (AGM) have declared their independence from the Company (according to the definition given in the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance).\n\nThe Supervisory Board appoints members of the Executive Board, monitors and supervises its decisions, and advises the Executive Board on strategy development. The Supervisory Board also assesses the performance of the Executive Board, including on sustainability criteria. The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on a regular and ad hoc basis. The Supervisory Board appoints among its members qualified expert committees that support their decision-making process. A self-assessment of the Supervisory Board is performed on an annual basis with the support of an external consultant. The 2023 evaluation showed positive results overall, with several areas where improvement in the work of the Supervisory Board had been observed in comparison to the 2022 results. For instance, it was highlighted that sustainability criteria now have an increasing importance in discussions and their decisionmaking process.\n\nThe Chairman of OMV's Supervisory Board regularly receives external feedback on the OMV Group's strategy, for example through the Corporate Governance Roadshows he attends or at the Annual General Meeting, among others.\n\nOMV's management of sustainability issues is overseen and steered by several committees.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue outlined circle with a blue house icon inside.

The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle. All icons are blue.\n\n## Sustainability & Transformation Committee\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Sustainability & Transformation Committee meets on a quarterly basis to discuss and steer topics such as regulatory ESG requirements, which include non-financial reporting requirements, ESG-related capital market activities, ESG governance and steering, and critical concerns related to sustainability.<sup>5</sup> The committee has oversight of all of the Company's material sustainability topics (e.g., health, safety, and security, carbon emissions reduction, circular economy, etc.) and their related KPIs and targets, as well as overall transformation topics, such as cultural changes and establishing ESG competency.\n\nAt the meetings of the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Sustainability & Transformation Committee gives a report to the entire plenary on a quarterly basis. The Sustainability & Transformation Committee and the entire Supervisory Board review and approve the OMV Group Sustainability Report every year. OMV's Supervisory Board benefits from a training program to learn about relevant topics, including ESG-related fields of interest. In 2023, the content of the training program included an external presentation delivered by a researcher from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) on the key outcomes of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change, which took place during a Sustainability & Transformation Committee meeting.\n\nThe evaluation of the Sustainability & Transformation Committee conducted as part of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment highlighted strong development since its formation in 2022. For instance, the committee has been actively responsible for monitoring the progress made with regard to OMV's Sustainability Strategy. In 2023, the committee saw that improvements had been made in ensuring that the response to significant incidents related to health, safety, security, and the environment was timely and effective.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability initiatives. At the top is the Supervisory Board, which oversees the Sustainability & Transformation Committee, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Portfolio & Project Committee, and Presidential & Nomination Committee. The Executive Board, consisting of the CEO, CFO, EVP Chemicals & Materials, EVP Fuels & Feedstock, and EVP Energy, is below the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board oversees the Sustainability Coordination Forum, Sustainability Steering Committee, and Risk Committee. There are also Business and other Group functions, including the Leadership team. The Group functions responsible for sustainability focus areas are Group Sustainability, Group HSSE, People & Culture, Compliance, Procurement, and Strategy. Group Sustainability includes overall ESG management, sustainability reporting and ESG disclosure, climate and carbon management, social responsibility, human rights, governance, communities, and NGOs. Group HSSE includes health, safety, well-being, environment-related topics, security, emergency, and crisis resilience. People & Culture includes employees, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Compliance includes compliance with business ethics and anti-corruption policies. Procurement includes supplier compliance with sustainable supply chain requirements. Strategy includes the overall strategic direction of OMV. All of these functions are connected to a network of functional experts in the business units/countries and local management team with topic accountability, as well as the Sustainability Business Partner (C&M, F&F, Energy).\n\n\\* Decided by the Executive Board; still to be set up\n\n<sup>5</sup> Critical concerns are cases that have raised significant attention from key stakeholders, have validity (e.g., legal decisions, allegations with significant proof etc.,), are in OMV's direct operations or value chain, and that would constitute a violation of one of the ten principles of theUNGlobal Compact. In 2023, three such concerns were flagged and discussed by the Sustainability & Transformation Committee. These concerns included a fatality at the Petrobrazi refinery, climate litigation, and an update on the Borealis Kallo case.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

This committee is chaired by OMV's CFO and consists of senior managers with responsibility and ownership for material topics, as well as relevant business representatives responsible for implementing OMV's sustainability and transformation agenda. Its mandate is to coordinate the\n\ndevelopment of the sustainability agenda across the OMV Group, monitor progress on target achievement, propose measures in the event of deviations, discuss emerging business opportunities, and prepare sustainability topics to be discussed by the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The committee meets at least twelve times per year.\n\n| Sustainability Coordination Forum                    |                                                         |                                                    |                                                  |                                             |                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| CFO                                                  |                                                         |                                                    |                                                  |                                             |                                                    |\n| SVP Investor<br>Relations &<br>Sustainability        | Head of<br>Department<br>Group<br>Sustainability        | SVP HSSE                                           | SVP People &<br>Culture                          | SVP Low Carbon<br>Business                  | SVP Legal                                          |\n| SVP Internal<br>Audit &<br>Compliance                | SVP Chief<br>Procurement<br>Officer                     | SVP Strategy                                       | Director Sust. &<br>Public Affairs<br>(Borealis) | SVP Business &<br>Digital<br>Transformation | SVP<br>Communications                              |\n| Director<br>Communication<br>& Sust.

This includes oversight of all material topics described in this Report, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, human rights, safety, etc. At Group level, responsibility for driving OMV's sustainability agenda, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability department in Investor Relations & Sustainability, which is among the responsibilities of the CFO. The Group Sustainability department works across the business to determine gaps in sustainability performance, define expectations, conduct benchmarking, and develop best practices.\n\nThe Group Sustainability department works in close collaboration with the various Group functions that are responsible for implementing OMV's Sustainability Framework. Further details are disclosed in the Governance\n\ndescriptions of each material topic found throughout this Report.\n\nGroup functions continuously develop and steer the processes relevant to the implementation of activities relating to social and environmental performance, and propose an action plan to functional experts in related business units on the ground. The functional experts remain in continuous communication regarding progress on the planned implementation. Each Group function reports directly to the Executive Board on the relevant social and environmental issues in conjunction with the Group Sustainability department. This includes reporting on progress in the implementation of the Sustainability Framework on a quarterly basis, presenting important events with regard to the material topics, and submitting implementation plans for sustainability initiatives for approval.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Therefore, assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of expected future economic conditions, which may differ from the Company's set targets, were used, including expectations about future worldwide decarbonization efforts and the transition of economies to net-zero emissions.\n\nOMV utilizes two different scenarios, namely the base case and the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' case, which differ in their underlying expectations of the pace of future worldwide decarbonization and result in distinct assumptions for demand, prices, and margins of fossil commodities.\n\nThe **base case** is built on a scenario developed by the internal Market Intelligence department and assumes that all decarbonization pledges announced by governments around the world will be implemented in full and on time. In this scenario, the temperature increase by 2100 will be limited to 1.7°C with a probability of 50%. The underlying demand and price developments of fossil commodities are in line with the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer, the second icon is a left arrow, and the third icon is a right arrow.\n\nwas modeled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The base case is used for mid-term planning as well as for estimates relating to the measurement of various items in the Group financial statements, including impairment testing of non-financial assets and the measurement of provisions.\n\nThe **'net-zero emissions by 2050'** case, which is based on a faster decarbonization path than the base case, is used for calculating sensitivities to recognize the uncertainty of the pace of the energy transition and to better understand the financial risk of the energy transition on the existing assets of OMV. The assumptions used in this case are in line with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario modeled by the IEA. It shows a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and is compatible with limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C.\n\nSensitivities, calculated based on the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' climate scenario using a simplified method consistent with a DCF model for impairment testing, indicate a risk of impairments of oil and gas assets, assessing the resilience against the energy transition risks.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the oil and gas assets with proved reserves (incl. E&P at-equity investments) would have to be decreased by EUR 4.4 bn and goodwill would decrease by EUR 0.3 bn. In addition, all oil and gas assets with unproved reserves would be abandoned with a pretax P&L impact of EUR 0.3 bn. Total post-tax impact on P&L would be EUR 3.6 bn.\n\nAs far as the C&M segment is concerned, management would not foresee negative effects on the overall demand of polyolefin solutions in the accelerated decarbonization scenario. Pricing of polyolefins is mainly driven by base chemical markets like naphtha, ethane, and propane. An accelerated change in the world's energy landscape might lead to different price movements in those relevant base\n\nchemicals, temporarily affecting the profitability of some assets in the polyolefin value chain. Driven by the expected strong demand for polyolefin solutions, management does not foresee any substantial negative effects on the overall integrated value chain.\n\nOMV plans to transform its European refineries so that they will stay competitive as the decarbonization of the fuels and chemical sector progresses. Crude oil distillation throughput will be decreased. The product mix will be adapted to reduce heating oil and diesel output while increasing the chemical yield. In parallel, a production portfolio of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks will be developed. Taking into account these transformation plans, management does not foresee a significant risk that the existing refinery assets in Europe would not be recoverable in the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' scenario.\n\nIt is expected that declines in demand for fossil products caused by the energy transition will progress more slowly outside the European Union. The investment in ADNOC Refining is assumed to be resilient also in a Paris Agreement-aligned the energy transition scenario thanks to its access to markets in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nFor retail, cash flows of less than ten years were sufficient to demonstrate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the currently existing assets. Consequently, there was no need to perform a calculation under the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' scenario.\n\nFor further information on base case and 'net-zero emissions by 2050' assumptions, please refer to the [Effects of](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/2-effects-of-climate-change-and-the-energy-transition.html) [climate change and the energy transition](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/2-effects-of-climate-change-and-the-energy-transition.html) section in the Annual Report, while risks from climate change and their management are detailed in the Risks and Opportunities section of the Sustainability Report and the [Risk Manage](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk.html)[ment section of the Directors' Report.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk.html)\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Focus Areas\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **Climate Change**\n- **Natural Resources Management**\n- **Health, Safety, and Security**\n- **People**\n- **Ethical Business Practices**\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/47/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

By 2050, OMV aims to transform into a net-zero business.<sup>7</sup>\n\nOMV has set out a roadmap with concrete interim short-, medium-, and long-term targets. OMV's targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scopes 1 and 2, OMV is aiming for an absolute reduction of 30% by 2030 and of 60% by 2040. For Scope 3, OMV is striving for a reduction of at least 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040 from our product portfolio and other material Scope 3 emissions. These absolute GHG emission reductions and the increase of zero-carbon product energy sales are key in reducing the carbon intensity of our energy supply, pursuing a decline of 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040. These targets are approximated to IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). However, our ambition is to achieve net-zero emissions already by 2050, thus being aligned with the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).\n\nTo achieve these targets, OMV takes climate action in its operations, product and service portfolio, circular economy activities, innovations and R&D activities, working environment, and social investments. There is no silver bullet for tackling climate change. Reaching our targets for 2030 and beyond will require a considerable effort by all of our business units, but it will be done by building on existing strengths and know-how.\n\nThese are the key pillars that will enable us to meet our goals:\n\n- A significant decrease in fossil fuels and natural gas sales: By 2030, we intend to reduce oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and cut crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t.\n- An increase in zero-carbon product energy sales: There will be a significant increase in sustainable and biobased fuels, green gas sales, and a build-up of renewable electricity capacity for captive use, as well as geothermal heat.\n- An increase in the recycling of polyolefins and sustainable feedstocks: We will deliver approximately 2 mn t/year of circular products, that is, polyolefins manufactured from recyclate or biogenic feedstock rather than fossil sources.\n- Improved energy and operational efficiency, and zero routine flaring and venting, thereby reducing methane emissions.\n- All energy purchases in the C&M segment will be 100% renewable. In 2023, electricity purchased by C&M accounted for 10 PJ – approximately 73% of OMV's total electricity purchased.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, neutralization measures such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will be necessary. OMV anticipates that it will develop around 5 mn t per year of CCS capacity across all business units until 2030. OMV aims to support and accelerate the energy transition with this new strategy.\n\nThe commitment \"net-zero business by 2050\" covers the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our operations (Scopes 1 and 2), and our product portfolio and other Scope 3 emissions along the value chain. For our interim GHG targets for 2030 and 2040, Scopes 1 and 2 and the following Scope 3 categories are included: Category 11: Use of Sold Products for energy supply, Category 1: Purchased Goods (feedstocks) from OMV's C&M business segment, and Category 12: End-of-Life of Sold Products for non-energy use. 7\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/4 description: The image is a bar graph showing a reduction in emissions over time.

The first icon, on the left, is set against a yellow background and features the number '7' prominently displayed at the top left. To the right of the number, the words 'AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY' are written in smaller font. Below the text, there is a white graphic of a sun with a power button symbol in the center.

Below the text, there is a white graphic of an eye with a globe in the center.\n\nThe Carbon Emissions Reduction material topic focuses on reducing the GHG emissions of our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) through targeted efforts such as improving energy efficiency, increased use of renewable electricity, modernizing our equipment and processes, and reducing venting and flaring of gas. These efforts are integral to meeting our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by 2050, which is also incorporated into our HSSE Policy. As part of our Strategy 2030, we have set specific interim targets for the short (2025), medium (2030), and long term (2040) on the path to meeting our 2050 goals.\n\nThe OMV Group uses 2019 as its base year for all three scopes of emissions and for our 2030, 2040, and 2050 targets because 2019 was the last full year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the majority of the OMV Group's assets were operating for the whole of 2019.\n\n| Targets 2025 | Reduce carbon intensity of operations8 (Scope 1) ≥30% vs. 2010<br>Achieve at least 1 mn t of CO2 reductions in 2020–2025 from operated assets |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target 2030  | Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by ≥30% vs. 2019                                                                                      |\n| Target 2040  | Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by ≥60% vs. 2019                                                                                      |\n\nCO2 equivalent emissions produced to generate a certain business output using the following business-specific metrics – in the E&P assets within OMV Energy: t CO2 equivalent/toe produced; refineries: t CO2 equivalent/t throughput (crude and semi-finished products without blended volumes); power: t CO2 equivalent/MWh produced – consolidated into an OMV Group Carbon Intensity Index, based on weighted average of the business segments' carbon intensity 8\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The OMV Group's comprehensive approach to managing GHG emissions encompasses GHG and energy accounting and reporting, inventory management, audits, assessment plans, and training for employees. The Group Sustainability team is also audited by OMV's internal auditing team on the completeness, correctness, reporting processes and methodologies, and quality assurance processes of our GHG accounting to confirm that the OMV Group reports Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in a complete and correct manner, that the accounting methodology complies with international standards, and that the reporting process is adequate. The last internal audit was conducted in 2020.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team continues to conduct on-site audits of GHG accounting to verify and improve transparency. For instance, in 2023 the team audited asset Valahia in OMV Petrom, which included a detailed assessment of the process of collecting data, the process of managing the data (measurement, estimations, assumptions, calculations, forecasts, consolidation, etc.), and the process of internal and external data communications. The audit confirmed the good practices already in place and highlighted some potential areas for improvement. For all findings and non-conformities, respective action plans are being defined and tracked for close-out in OMV's HSSE reporting tool.\n\n#### Governance\n\nUltimate responsibility for reducing carbon emissions lies with OMV's Executive Board. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for the overall management and coordination and is therefore also responsible for overseeing climate-related issues. OMV Executive Board members meet regularly (at least quarterly) to discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, related developments in the fuels and gas market, the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations, the status of innovation project implementation, and progress on achieving climate targets. The Executive Board's remuneration is linked to the achievement of our GHG emissions reduction targets (for more information, see Sustainability Governance).\n\nOMV's Supervisory Board also oversees the carbon emissions reduction topic. The Sustainability & Transformation Committee was formed in 2021 to support the Company's Supervisory Board in reviewing and monitoring OMV's sustainability strategy, ESG-related standards, performance, and processes, and specifically, the Group's performance in HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, Environment) and climate change. For example, one of their responsibilities is to review and evaluate the progress we are making toward OMV's objectives in relation to our carbon footprint, climate change, and the energy transition.\n\nAt Group level, responsibility for GHG accounting and management, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability team in Investor Relations & Sustainability, an area overseen by the CFO. OMV's Group Sustainability department is responsible for generating OMV's GHG inventory based on international standards and best practice. This ensures a consistent approach across the Group.\n\nThe main tasks of the team are:\n\nto define, implement, and manage OMV's GHG Management Framework, including the OMV Group's Climate Targets\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a triangular roof and a rectangular body.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n- to monitor, calculate, and report OMV's GHG emissions (Scopes 1–3), and\n- to define OMV's GHG accounting and reporting protocols and tools.\n\nThe team coordinates activities throughout the business, providing guidance to stakeholder groups such as subsidiaries, business units, and assets on GHG and energyrelated topics. To ensure consistency across the Group, there are also dedicated teams in OMV Petrom and Borealis. Tailored voluntary training on GHG accounting, monitoring and management, sustainability, and climate change is developed by the experts in the Group Sustainability team and offered to interested employees Groupwide.\n\nIn OMV's Capital Allocation Framework, a project category called \"Sustainability Projects\" allows certain projects to meet different economic return requirements. These projects are assessed and scored according to a strategic climate scoring methodology for Group-wide investment projects. This enables the impact of investments on OMV's decarbonization strategy to be considered. Alongside other strategic scoring aspects, this allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support the achievement of our GHG reduction targets (for more information, see Sustainability Governance).\n\nThe Group-wide GHG Management Framework is an OMV Group regulation that defines how to measure, report, and manage GHG emissions and contains the definitions, boundaries, and rules for the OMV Group's strategic GHG reduction targets and \"net zero by 2050\" ambition. The regulation also includes requirements for Scope 1 E&P methane emissions accounting, which will align with the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Framework as a minimum and require sourcelevel measurement of methane emissions (OGMP 2.0 level 4) operated by the Energy division by 2026. According to OGMP 2.0, Level 4 refers to the source level quantification of methane emissions using specific emissions factors established through direct measurements, sampling, and/ or detailed engineering calculations.\n\n## Flaring, Venting, and Fugitive Methane Emissions\n\nDuring oil production, associated gas is produced together with the oil. While much of this gas is utilized, some of it is routinely flared due to technical or economic constraints, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane. In 2017, to reinforce our clear commitment to responsible resource management and sustainable business, we endorsed the World Bank's \"Zero routine flaring by 2030\" initiative to end routine flaring of\n\nassociated gas during oil production by 2030. Phasing out routine flaring is an essential step in combining resource efficiency with long-term economic success, as well as a way of supporting the decarbonization of our operations. We see financial opportunities in the monetization of hydrocarbon resources by utilizing the previously flared gas and/or selling it. Phasing out routine flaring improves the environmental and safety conditions at our respective assets, thereby enabling us to not only maintain our license to operate but also avoid any penalties.\n\nReducing methane emissions from the routine/non-routine venting of gas during oil and gas production and processing, as well as from gas leaks, also contributes to slowing down climate change and provides a valuable mitigation option for climate risk management. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. It is the most abundant anthropogenic GHG after CO2 and second in its overall contribution to climate change. Its greenhouse effect is significantly stronger in the short term, making it more potent than CO2. In our climate strategy, we therefore also introduced a target for reducing methane emissions for the first time.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Phasing Out Routine Flaring and Venting**\n\nAround 1% of OMV's total direct GHG emissions and around 5% of OMV's Energy GHG direct emissions result from routine flaring. With stricter policies requiring zero routine flaring expected, OMV has taken initial steps toward compliance by voluntarily endorsing the World Bank's \"Zero routine flaring by 2030\" initiative. We report to the World Bank on our progress on this initiative annually. All OMV operations are required to minimize methane emissions from point sources, as well as fugitive emissions and technically avoidable emissions (such as well testing and well workover, among others). New production sites are developed with the appropriate gas utilization solutions in place and without routine flaring. Existing sites, where routine flaring of associated and free gas still occurs, are required to develop a phase-out plan to eliminate legacy routine flaring as soon as possible, but no later than 2030.\n\nIn our refineries, state-of-the-art plant design is implemented to avoid routine flaring, for example through the use of flare gas recovery and balancing the fuel gas systems. This type of advanced process control includes sufficient capacity for the flare gas recovery system, the use of high-integrity relief valves, and other economically viable organizational and control measures. All refineries use a flare gas recovery system to collect excess gas, which is desulphurized as required, pressurized, and added to the refinery fuel gas system as fuel for the process furnaces. As a result of such measures, we aim to use flaring as a safety system during unplanned operations, which include\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nstart-up, shutdown, emergency, process upsets, and others. At the Petrobrazi refinery in particular, the capacity for flare gas recovery has been increased over the past few years. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are minimized by applying the best available techniques (BATs) in such areas as hydrocarbon storage and tank seals according to implementation plans.\n\n#### **Fugitive Emissions Monitoring and Leak Detection and Repair**\n\nFugitive methane emissions and other non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are monitored or estimated and controlled systematically with leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs. Knowing the main potential sources of methane emissions also allows us to implement precautionary measures for preventing such emissions at new production assets. The minimum requirement for identifying leaks is conducting routine audio, visual, and olfactory inspections as part of daily operator rounds at all relevant OMV operating facilities. Leak detection also entails soap-bubble testing and optical gas imaging with defined scopes and intervals (annually or more frequently, as required in accordance with a corresponding risk assessment). At some facilities, infrared cameras are also used for leak detection. We also collaborate with third parties to further enhance state-of-the-art methane monitoring with technologies such as drones, satellite data, and acoustic leak imaging.\n\nLeaks are repaired immediately or within defined time frames and, depending on prioritization, according to the site's maintenance processes. These are based on the risk assessment outcomes and other factors including feasibility of repair during operation. To prevent and mitigate fugitive emissions, we have taken important steps, including implementing a pipeline integrity program and modernizing facilities such as compressor stations.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Decarbonization Initiatives**\n\nAt OMV Petrom, several initiatives have been initiated to reduce methane emissions, routine venting, and flaring, including various modernization and upgrade projects for oil and gas processing, production, and transportation infrastructure. In 2023, the Production System Padina in Asset Moldova installed a combined heat and power unit (CHP) that recovers the gas that would otherwise be vented and/or flared. This will result in an emissions reduction of approximately 18,000 t CO2e during the first full year after implementation.\n\n- In August 2023, a performance test for the Bărbuncești Compressor Station in Asset Moldova was successfully carried out before it was put into operation. This project is partly a continuation of the project initiated in 2014 and aims to improve the performance of the compression system. As an integrating section for that project, the Merișani-Vâlcele and Brăgăreasa-Colelia compression stations were completed and the Brădești compression station is currently under construction. The new system architecture will reduce operational costs significantly, ensure flexible and safe natural gas collection and compression, and improve safety by introducing new equipment while dismantling old equipment that present some integrity problems and significant operational risks. The new system meets the Transgaz requirements for increasing system pressures up to 40 barg. Lower GHG emissions are expected by minimizing possible leaks and through more efficient energy consumption.\n- 2023 was a milestone year for OMV New Zealand in terms of the completion of decarbonization projects. Two projects were implemented at the Raroa production system in Asset Maari. First, a reverse osmosis unit was installed in order to replace the steam-driven water maker. Reducing the steam demand resulted in lower consumption of the fuel oil, leading to an emissions reduction of approximately 6,000 t CO2e. The second project's scope was the replacement of fuel gas with nitrogen in the flare purge process. A nitrogen generator was already available on site, offering an opportunity for the project to minimize investment costs. The emissions reduction impact from this project is estimated at approximately 3,000 t CO2e. Other projects with a decarbonization effect in New Zealand that have been trialed or implemented include changes to the turbine's operating concept, pressure optimization at the production separator, optimization of the compressor surge controller, and installation of solar panels on the roof of the warehouse. The combined emissions reduction impact from these projects is approximately 4,200 t CO2e.\n- As OMV and Borealis operate joint facilities in Schwechat and Burghausen, we strive to identify and increase joint synergies across both sites. For instance, at the Burghausen refinery from mid-2023, the quantity of flared gas was reduced, as the discontinuous nitrogen-rich gases produced by OMV were combusted in the Borealis regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) plant, rather than being sent to the elevated flare.\n- Borealis completed the cracker furnace upgrade in Stenungsund, Sweden, with the final furnace upgraded in 2023. This will generate a total annual reduction of up to 24,000 t CO2e.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/53/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nFlaring was reduced in Porvoo, Finland, which resulted in savings of 500 t CO2e annually.\n\n#### **Leak Detection and Repair**\n\nOMV consistently implements leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs to reduce our fugitive emissions. Important steps have been taken to prevent and mitigate fugitive emissions, such as the pipeline integrity program in OMV Energy and the LDAR program in both OMV Energy and Fuels & Feedstock (F&F). An LDAR program includes two fundamental steps: first, the identification of the leaking components and second, the repair of these leaks to minimize losses. This program serves as the basis for developing reduction projects in accordance with best practices in the industry and using the best available technologies. LDAR programs are routinely run both upstream (OMV Energy) and downstream (OMV F&F) to detect, prevent, and eliminate fugitive emissions. In OMV Energy, following the guidelines of the GHG Management Framework, methane emission programs have been established in line with the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Framework, which accepts LDAR as the most efficient method for detecting fugitive methane emissions from the operations and mitigating them. In OMV Austria, an internal LDAR team has been formed in order to perform regular screening of the production and processing sites by utilizing high-standard technologies (e.g., OGI, FLIR cameras, etc.). In addition, more than 300 facilities are included in the internal LDAR program led by Operations in OMV Petrom, which covers methane screening using FLIR cameras and mitigation of identified leakages. Furthermore, LDAR programs have become an integral part of operations, establishing strong partnerships with external service providers for compliance with our GHG Management Framework, as well as with other frameworks such as upcoming EU Regulations for methane emissions in the energy sector.\n\n#### **Methane Reporting**\n\nIn line with the OMV Group's GHG Management Framework, which references the OGMP 2.0, OMV Energy-operated businesses shall reach source-level measurement of methane emissions (equivalent with Level 4) by the end of 2025.\n\nFurthermore, the upcoming EU methane legislation will introduce additional stringent requirements for methane leak detection and repair programs, as well as for methane monitoring and reporting at source level and site level. In OMV Energy, OMV has already started taking important steps toward compliance with both the GHG Management Framework and the EU methane reporting requirements within the given deadlines for the ventures that are affected, i.e., OMV Austria and OMV Petrom.\n\nGlobal and local methane management programs (such as Ops CH4llenge at OMV Petrom) have been established within OMV Energy with the purpose of preparing the operations' organization for the new methane detection, measurement and reporting requirements. For that purpose, multiple pilot tests with various technologies, solutions, and service providers were executed by the end of 2023. An extensive pilot project has been completed at representative sites in three assets at OMV Petrom. The detection and quantification services were performed by third-party specialized contractors. This enabled us to achieve the following reporting levels:\n\n- Source-level methane emissions for operated assets by direct measurements and sampling to establish the specific emission factors\n- Source-level methane emissions for operated assets complemented by measurements of site-level methane emissions, thereby allowing assessment and verification of the source-level estimates aggregated by site\n\nBased on the outcome of the pilot project, a rollout strategy has been developed and converted into a scope of work for outsourcing the services for methane measurement reporting and verification for affected assets at OMV Austria and Romania.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, OMV will continue to pursue projects to further phase out routine flaring and venting, reduce Scope 1 emissions, and expand and intensify our LDAR campaigns. For example, an LDAR campaign has been planned in Tunisia, where pilot Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) camera screening will be conducted for the Gas Treatment Plant (GTP) to quantify the leaks and establish an appropriate action plan. In addition, other sustainability and decarbonization projects that specifically target flaring and venting reduction and are currently in the execution phase in multiple assets at OMV Petrom are expected to be completed by 2025 at the latest. At the Burghausen refinery, the current gasometer is scheduled to be replaced with a membrane gasometer, which has a greater gas storage volume. This is expected to reduce the intervals and quantity of gas flared, and result in an annual reduction of 1,800 t CO2e.\n\nIn general, we will focus on reducing fugitive methane emissions through process optimization, field modernization, and integrity improvement measures in OMV Energy. We continue to define and implement methane leakage, detection, and repair programs in all OMV Energy-operated assets, as well as establishing standard methane reporting with the required granularity (e.g., source level, site level).\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white house icon inside.

In 2019, the value is 117.4. In 2020, the value is 131.1. In 2021, the value is 176.2. In 2022, the value is 163.2. In 2023, the value is 142.9.\n\nAs an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company, the OMV Group operates large facilities and is also a major energy consumer. The amount of energy we use creates a significant impact on the environment. Effective management of energy consumption reduces the environmental cost of our operations, increases financial savings owing to our energy efficiency measures, prevents non-compliance with regulatory requirements on energy use, and reduces GHG emissions.\n\nEnergy efficiency measures therefore have a considerable effect on issues relating to energy consumption and are of particular interest to certain stakeholders:\n\n- Government authorities: compliance with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) regulations relating to the submission of emission allowances within the EU ETS, compliance with the national transposition of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, which requires greater energy efficiency in all stages of the energy value chain, and performing obligatory energy efficiency audits every four years\n- Shareholders and other stakeholders with a direct financial interest in the OMV Group: financial savings resulting from reduced energy consumption, lower production costs, and lower GHG emissions\n- NGOs/NPOs: reduced impact of our operations on the environment\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n**57%** of sites are ISO 50001 certified\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires that all OMV businesses and activities use energy responsibly, conserve primary energy resources, and\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The first icon is a printer, the second icon is a left arrow, and the third icon is a right arrow.\n\nimplement energy management plans in accordance with ISO 50001.\n\n#### **Identification Measures**\n\nThe potential for reducing energy use is identified in annual campaigns encouraging improved environmental performance, including energy consumption. For example, we have set targets for the refineries to reach certain energy intensity index ratings through annual monitoring campaigns. Based on their energy intensity, we identify and assess areas for improvement in terms of energy efficiency. Subsequently, we decide which measures to implement to reduce energy consumption as part of our environmental governance process.\n\nBorealis is responsible for 24% of the energy consumption of the OMV Group. Furthermore, Borealis sees the energyefficiency-first principle as a cornerstone in achieving its climate strategy. The defined energy ambition is to implement 10% energy savings of the consumption of 2015 by 2030. As OMV and Borealis operate joint facilities in Schwechat and Burghausen, an initiative to identify and increase joint synergies across both sites was established.\n\nProjects identified in 2022 were evaluated during 2023, with the potential for implementation from 2024 onward. For instance, the Schwechat refinery currently supplies boiler feed water to the Borealis facility. By adapting the supply lines, this boiler feed water can be replaced with cheaper, colder, and fully desalinated water, resulting in energy and CO2 savings.\n\n#### **Technical Improvements**\n\nEnergy efficiency measures in OMV operations are closely linked with technical improvements directed at reducing energy use while achieving the same operational output. Process optimization and increasing energy efficiency to reduce costs and CO2 emissions are also a priority at our refineries. At the Schwechat refinery, measures have included the optimization of the blade rows in one of the steam turbines, which has resulted in an increase in the efficiency of the high-pressure section of the turbine, and a subsequent increase in the electrical output equal to the steam rate. Ultrasonic atomizer nozzles for power plant boilers were also installed to promote the atomization of liquid fuel to improve the quality of combustion. This resulted in a reduction in exhaust gas losses, fuel demand, combustion air demand, and CO2 emissions.\n\nThe implementation of planned energy efficiency measures was interrupted by the unplanned shutdown of the RD4 crude oil distillation plant at the Schwechat refinery in 2022, resulting in severe delays. Some of the measures were implemented in 2023, and those remaining are expected to be finalized in 2024.\n\n#### **Sourcing Renewable Energy for Operations**\n\nWe are increasingly turning to renewable sources of electricity to power our operations. One way of doing this is by purchasing renewable energy, which subsequently reduces our Scope 2 emissions. For instance, in our refineries in Schwechat and Burghausen, electricity contracts stipulate that 50% of purchased electricity must be from renewable sources. As such, in 2023, 50% of the purchased electricity at the Schwechat refinery and the Adria Wien Pipeline (AWP), 51.8% at the Burghausen refinery, including tank farms and pumping stations, came from renewable sources. 100% of the electricity purchased by OMV's Austrian filling stations and the head office are obtained from renewable sources. For OMV's refineries and the AWP, the electricity contracts are generally spot-indexed and contracted on a one- to threeyear basis. Commodity pricing risk is managed using financial risk instruments.\n\nTo reduce our Scope 2 emissions and to achieve the target Borealis has set of sourcing 100% of the electricity it uses from renewable sources by 2030, the OMV Group continued to establish Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to source renewable electricity on a longer-term basis, and sourced the electricity and utilities needed for its production processes. Several PPAs with renewable energy providers are already in place. These include:\n\n- PPA between OMV and WEB Windenergie AG. With an output of 5.6 MW and annual electricity production of 13.7 GWh, the anticipated clean wind energy supplied to the OMV Group will be used to generate green hydrogen using an electrolyzer at the Schwechat refinery in 2023.\n- Borealis and Finnish energy company Fortum have signed a long-term PPA to source renewable energy from two onshore wind parks. Starting mid-2024, 800 GWh of renewable power will be supplied to the Borealis production operations in Porvoo, Finland, over the course of eight years.\n- Borealis and Axpo Nordic, a subsidiary of Switzerland's largest renewable energy provider, have a PPA for wind energy, which includes the annual supply of more than 130,000 MWh of wind power to the Borealis production location in Stenungsund, Sweden, over the next ten years. The electricity will be generated by a new onshore wind farm (Hultema) located in central Sweden, with delivery expected to start in January 2024.\n- In Belgium, Borealis has a PPA with Eneco, a Dutch energy supplier. The energy will be generated by an existing offshore wind park (Mermaid) located in the North Sea.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nBorealis has a co-investment agreement with VERBUND to build a PV plant (4.8 MWp) at its production location in Schwechat, Austria, and a ten-year PPA to obtain renewable hydroelectricity from two existing hydro plants in Austria, which are part of VERBUND's portfolio.\n\nTo help reduce our Scope 1 emissions, the OMV Group also produces renewable energy and uses it to power our operations. Some of these initiatives include:\n\n- In Austria, OMV and VERBUND built a ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) plant at Schönkirchen with a total capacity of 15.32 MWp. The generated electricity is used for ongoing operations in OMV Energy Austria. Since mid-2022, the photovoltaic plant installed during both Phases I and II has been operational simultaneously. In 2023, approx. 13.6 GWh of renewable energy was produced and used for ongoing operations at our Austrian E&P assets within our OMV Energy business segment.\n- The commercial operation of OMV's PV installation in Lobau began in early 2022, where a PV tracker system with an output of 5.6 MWp was installed. In comparison to a fixed installation, the tracker system, which follows the path of the sun, enables an increase in the generation of sustainable electricity of approximately 10%. Production efficiency was increased by another 5% by installing solar panels with bifacial (double-sided) modules. In 2023, the PV plant at the Lobau tank farm produced around 7.0 GWh of renewable energy covering approximately 45% of the annual electricity demand of the tank farm and resulting in savings of around 2,100 t CO2 per year.\n- In Norway, our joint venture partner Equinor reached full output of renewable power produced from the largest floating offshore wind farm called Hywind Tampen. The Hywind Tampen wind farm consists of eleven floating wind turbines with a total capacity of 88 MW, offsetting 200,000 t of CO2 emissions and 1,000 t of NOx emissions per year. The capacity covers the annual power demand of five platforms at the Snorre and Gullfaks oil and gas fields in the North Sea. In 2023, 48.3 MW of renewable energy was delivered to the Snorre and Gullfaks fields and 50,000 t CO2 emissions were saved.\n- The Cosmești solar park comprises 6,500 photovoltaic panels installed over an area of approximately 30,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The green energy produced (approximately 2,500 MWh/year) will be used to supply electricity for ongoing operations in the E&P segment. This will result in a reduction of about 550 t CO2.\n- The Brădești solar park comprises 3,350 photovoltaic panels installed over an area of approximately 18,500 m<sup>2</sup>. The green energy produced (approximately 1,200 MWh/year) will be used to supply electricity for ongoing operations in the E&P segment. This will result in a reduction of about 250 t CO2.\n- In Tunisia, utility air compressors with photovoltaic panels were installed at the Waha wells, while the Nawara well sites and pipeline valve stations were also equipped with PV panels for autonomous electricity generation.\n- By the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, PV panels were installed at approximately 1,700 OMV and OMV Petrom filling stations The electricity produced from these installations annually is estimated at 8,900 MWh and presents savings of approximately 2,400 t CO2e.\n- The installation of solar panels on the roof of the warehouse in Māui, New Zealand, was completed in 2023. 196 panels were installed with approximately 78 kW capacity; of that, approximately 20 kW is used for internal purposes and the excess is exported.\n\nBorealis is working to reduce its energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and increased the share of renewable energy consumed from 28% in 2022 to approximately 38% in 2023, as well as signing PPAs to lock in renewable energy supply for years to come.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Energy Efficiency**\n\nEnergy efficiency measures implemented at our three refineries in 2023 have made it possible to achieve an annual reduction of more than 27.5 kt CO2e and energy savings of 654 TJ. These include:\n\n- The HDS2 project was implemented at the Burghausen refinery in June 2023. It has an annual savings potential of about 37 TJ and CO2 savings potential of about 2.1 kt. Thanks to the two new and improved reactor effluent heat exchangers, the fired heat in the HDS2 furnace can be reduced.\n- Due to commissioning and the refinery shutdown, the District Heating Hub at the Schwechat refinery was not in full operation in 2023. When it was operational, around 100 TJ and 6 kt of CO2 was saved.\n- At OMV Petrom, an upgrade of the aromatic complex was initiated at the Petrobrazi refinery, and once finalized in 2025, it will achieve an annual saving of approximately 49 TJ and a CO2 savings potential of about 3.2 kt. These savings will be achieved thanks to the extractive distillation technology, which reduces the amount of steam consumed.\n\nIn C&M, examples of energy efficiency measures taken include the following:\n\nBorealis successfully completed a major upgrade to its steam cracker operations in Stenungsund, Sweden. The overhaul is expected to realize yearly CO2 emissions reductions of up to 24,000 t.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nA new regenerative thermal oxidizer was successfully installed at Porvoo and is expected to significantly lower the site's CO2 emissions, reduce flaring, and save around 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy annually.\n\nIn OMV's Energy segment, the key energy efficiency projects included the following:\n\n- In Norway, OMV and Wintershall signed a five-year rig contract for the use of the Transocean Norge platform. OMV will drill a minimum of seven wells with this rig, including four exploration wells and one development well. Energy efficiency is part of a contract incentive to reduce fuel consumption and further reduce CO2 and NOx emissions. The rig was used in a drilling campaign in August and September 2023 that resulted in an emissions reduction of 27% and 76% reduction of NOx. In the Velocette drilling campaign, energy optimization software and a closed bus system for dynamic positioning were employed to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 27%.\n- In the Māui field in New Zealand, the Māui A gas turbine generators were optimized by shifting the load between two units, thus allowing them to operate more efficiently. At the Māui Production Station, the surge controllers on the refrigerator compressors were also optimized, reducing the gas recycle as a result. Between the two projects, a saving of approximately 4,250 t CO2e will be achieved annually.\n- A legally required energy audit was conducted for Waha CPF, Nawara CPF, and GTP to assess the energy performance of the plants and implement appropriate improvement actions.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nWe will continue to identify measures to improve energy efficiency and operational renewable energy initiatives. Examples of actions to be taken in the coming years are as follows:\n\n- At the Schwechat refinery, a new preheating system will be installed for steam boiler 5, which is expected to result in an estimated saving of 2,000 t CO2e.\n- In Burghausen, the waste steam condensate stream from the Metathesis plant will be used to heat the cooler steam condensate from the crack-gas compressor increasing the energy efficiency of the process and resulting in an annual reduction of approximately 2,300 t CO2e. By 2025, OMV Petrom aims to install PVs at half of its network of OMV Petrom filling stations. PV panels at additional OMV filling stations in Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia are also scheduled to be installed in 2024.\n- In Austria, additional PV plants will become operational, including in Arbesthal and Würmlach, which will have a power output of approximately 1.1 MWp and 3 MWp respectively.\n\nWe will continue to increase our sourcing of renewable energy to power our operations. For the OMV Group, will aim to source an additional 580–780 GWh per annum of renewable electricity through additional PPAs and solar power investments. In C&M, the segment purchasing the greatest amount of energy, our aim is to ensure that all energy purchased is renewable by 2030. In the future, where local regulations permit, we also plan to produce renewable energy and feed it into the electricity grid for use by third parties. The potential for doing this in the countries where we have business operations is currently being evaluated.\n\n## Energy Transition\n\n#### **Material Topic: Energy Transition**\n\nSupporting the goals of the Paris Agreement by reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, specifically by increasing sales of zero-carbon energy products such as renewable mobility fuels and renewable power\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\nGRI 305: Emissions 2016 Environmental concerns\n\n**Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/21 description: The image contains two Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) icons. The first icon, on the left, is SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. It features the number 7 and the text \"AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY\" above a white sun-like symbol with a power button in the center, all set against a yellow background. The second icon, on the right, is SDG 13: Climate Action. It displays the number 13 and the text \"CLIMATE ACTION\" above a white eye-shaped symbol containing a depiction of the Earth, all set against a green background.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an oil, gas, and chemicals company, we are aware that a large percentage of our emissions come from the use of our products. At present, about 78% of the OMV Group's products are directly used for combustion, significantly contributing to global climate change. As such, we have a unique responsibility in this regard, and understand that a \"business as usual\" approach is no longer an option.\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/13 description: This image is a pie chart titled \"GHG Scope 3 Emissions from Products\" and shows the breakdown of emissions in mn t CO2 equivalent. The total emissions are 100 mn t CO2. The chart includes the following categories and their corresponding values: Oil to energy (e.g., transportation fuels) at 57.5, Gas to energy at 30.6, Chemicals at 5.0, Oil to non-energy (e.g., petrochemicals) at 5.1, and Gas to non-energy (e.g., methanol) at 1.3.\n\nThe Energy Transition material topic focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, specifically through increasing sales of zero-carbon energy products such as renewable mobility fuels and renewable power. This is the centerpiece of OMV's commitment to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, and becoming a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner in alignment with the IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. To concretize our 2050 goals, we have set mid- and long-term targets to reduce our absolute Scope 3 emissions by at least 20% by 2030 and by at least 50% by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. In addition, we intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy supply by at least 20% by 2030 and by at least 50% by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. These intermediate targets on our pathway to net zero by 2050 are approximated to the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2°C and is thus aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### **Carbon Intensity of Energy Supply**<sup>11</sup>\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/5 description: The image is a line graph titled \"Carbon Intensity of Energy Supply\" with the y-axis labeled \"In g CO2/MJ\". The x-axis represents years from 2019 to 2023, and target years 2030 and 2040. The data points for the years 2019 to 2023 are as follows: 2019: 69.8, 2020: 68.2, 2021: 67.4, 2022: 67.5, 2023: 69.1. The target values are 55.9 for 2030 and 34.9 for 2040.\n\nOur absolute emissions targets cover all parts of the OMV Group, i.e., the upstream, downstream, and chemicals segments and their respective value chains. These divisions are expected to decarbonize at different rates, with a higher rate of decarbonization forecast in our energy segments (Energy and Fuels & Feedstock). This is attributable to the immediate reductions that will be achieved by our plans to minimize fossil fuel production and sales: We aim to decrease oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and reduce crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t, both by 2030. Growth in these segments will instead come from zerocarbon products, such as geothermal energy, photovoltaic, wind, hydrogen, and sustainable fuels. In our Energy segment, we will build up around 10 TWh of renewable energy production (including geothermal, PV, and wind). In our Fuels & Feedstock (F&F) segment, we are primarily focusing on finding solutions for hard-to-electrify market segments, such as heavy road transportation and air travel, as well as providing feedstock for greener chemical production. Overall, we plan to grow production of renewable mobility fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks to approximately 1.5 mn t and produce and market at least 700 kta of sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. This scale-up of zero-carbon energy product sales while decreasing fossil fuel sales is central to OMV's climate strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, our chemicals segment is projected to grow by 35% in monomer production volumes and 30% in polyolefins production volumes by 2030. In this non-energy segment, we will also reduce our Scope 3 emissions by pursuing circular economy technologies, but not at the same rate as our energy segments.\n\nIn this material topic, we focus on reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, as encapsulated in the key metric \"carbon intensity of energy supply,\" for which we have also set 2030 and 2040 targets. However, our circular economy solutions also play a central role in our climate and carbon footprint reduction strategy. Read more about our efforts on this topic in Circular Economy.\n\n<sup>10</sup> Includes Scope 3, Category 10: Processing of sold products, and Scope 3, Category 11: Use of sold products\n\n<sup>11</sup> The carbon intensity of the energy supply is measured by assessing the intensity of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions plus Scope 3 emissions (in g CO2) from the use of sold energy products, against the total energy value of all externally sold energy products (in MJ) (excluding purely traded volumes). GHG data that is part of OMV's 2030 and 2040 targets is subject to baseline recalculation; therefore, historical data has been recalculated. See Environmental Data for more details.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThis concept allows OMV's existing refineries to produce transportation fuels from various types of biogenic feedstock.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, OMV successfully conducted the first field trials of Co-Processing at the Schwechat refinery using rapeseed oil, and obtained certification in accordance with the REDcert standard, an EU-recognized system for the certification of sustainable biomass. In 2020, another field trial was successfully completed at the Petrobrazi refinery. OMV continues to implement the Co-Processing technology and in 2024, the Company aims to start the co-processing of sustainable feedstock in Schwechat. It is important to note that no palm oil will be co-processed. The project will start with a mix of vegetable oils (rapeseed oil and sunflower oil). It may include some other waste and residue or advanced streams like used cooking oil or cashew nutshell liquid in future (2024–2025). In December 2020, OMV committed to investing EUR 200 mn in the construction of the Co-Processing unit at the Schwechat refinery. Utilizing this process will lead to an annual reduction of OMV's carbon footprint of up to 360 kt CO2, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of around 200,000 cars driving an average of 12,000 km per year.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Geothermal Energy**\n\nOMV and Wien Energie are joining forces to deliver the heating transition. In a joint venture called \"deeep,\" the two companies are working closely to make deep geothermal energy a reality in the greater Vienna area. The aim is to develop deep geothermal plants with an output of up to 200 MW, thereby generating climate-neutral district heating for the equivalent of up to 200,000 Viennese households. The partners are also planning to implement up to seven deep geothermal plants in Vienna as part of drilling programs. The first deep geothermal plant is to be realized together by the partners in the joint venture. The plant will generate up to 20 MW of climate-neutral district heating – in combination with heat pumps from Wien Energie. The aim is to supply up to 20,000 Viennese households with district heating from this plant. Approval procedures are currently underway and drilling is due to start toward the end of 2024. The plant is scheduled to go into operation in 2027. Making the project part of the joint venture allows the partners to glean valuable insights and data for follow-up projects, enabling Wien Energie and OMV to realize the further expansion of geothermal energy in Vienna more quickly and efficiently.\n\nOMV acquired a 6.5% stake in Canadian privately owned Eavor Technologies Inc. for the amount of EUR 34 mn. Eavor is the leading closed-loop geothermal energy solution\n\ndeveloper worldwide. In addition, OMV and Eavor have entered into a commercial agreement to pursue large-scale deployments of Eavor-Loop™ technology in Europe and beyond. The commercial agreement establishes OMV as a key partner with preferred licensing terms, access to services, and development support. OMV's initial focus will be on the deployment of Eavor-Loop™ in Austria and Germany. Eavor's technology is based on a closed-loop system, installed in deep subsurface rock, whereby a working fluid is circulated between surface and deep subsurface rock in a closed loop and therefore heated up. The technology reduces the geological and hence operational risk significantly compared to normal hydrothermal systems with similar energy output. As Eavor-Loop™ is truly scalable and applicable in various types of geological structures, it will enable OMV to offer heat solutions for district heating networks outside of the normal hydrothermal areas and therefore complement its existing portfolio of hydrothermal projects.\n\nOMV is constantly evaluating and maturing further opportunities and projects with regards to open- and closed-loop geothermal.\n\n#### **Renewable Energy**\n\nOMV Petrom and Complexul Energetic (CE) Oltenia will begin the construction of four solar parks, which will provide a combined capacity of approximately 450 MW. The total investment required for the establishment of these four photovoltaic parks exceeds EUR 400 mn, with 70% of the funding coming from the Modernization Fund. The PV parks will be built in Ișalnița, Tismana, Roșia and Rovinari, on the sites of the former mining operations managed by CE Oltenia. Based on current estimates, the PV parks should supply electricity to the national energy system from 2024 onward. In addition, OMV Petrom has signed an agreement to acquire a number of projects for the construction of solar parks in Teleorman county. The projects will go into the execution phase by the second quarter of 2024 and, with a total power output of 710 MW, will supply enough power for 280,000 Romanian households annually.\n\n#### **Glycerin2Propanol**\n\nAfter seven years of successful development within OMV, the implementation of the Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant at the Schwechat refinery site marks a significant step toward advancing the technology maturity (barrel/hour scale; TRL 6–7). In October 2023, important milestones were reached with the delivery of the last modules and placement on the foundation. The final assembly of the Glycerin2Propanol plant is now underway, with only a few stages left before mechanical completion. The OMV-patented technology will produce propanol from low-value material crude glycerin by the end of Q1 2024. The plant will use a catalyst, or reaction accelerator, developed in-house by OMV to transform the biogenic waste-based crude glycerin into a so-\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is simple, with a triangular roof and a rectangular body.

The first icon is a printer, the second is a left arrow, and the third is a right arrow.\n\ncalled advanced bioalcohol (propanol). In doing so, the plant will generate what are known as advanced biofuels, which are not in competition with foodstuffs and which, when added to gasoline, reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nWhile glycerin is a waste/by-product of the production of biodiesel and the manufacture of detergents and soaps, it is also considered an advanced biobased feedstock under the European Union's RED III Renewable Energy Directive. This means that the feedstock is not part of the food chain and does not compete for land use for food. The propanol produced in this way will then be used as an advanced bioadditive for gasoline. It can also be used as a sustainable feedstock for the chemicals market to replace fossilfuel-based propanol. OMV is set to invest around EUR 30 mn in the scale-up of this project, of which around EUR 8 mn will be funded through the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft; FFG) and the COVID-19 premium. The capacity of the pilot plant will be 1.25 mn l of propanol per year. This will lead to a CO2 reduction of around 1,800 t annually. A total of 1.2 l of crude glycerin is needed to produce 1 l of propanol. Under moderate temperature and pressure, 1 barrel (159 liters) of propanol will be produced per hour in an energy-efficient process. The long-term plan is to commercialize the technology to produce around 125 mn l of propanol per year and reduce CO2 emissions by around 180 kt. The Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant will be located at the Schwechat refinery alongside the ReOil® plant so that both units can take advantage of a combined operator station, exploiting the synergy of a shared operator concept. In addition to this unique in-house development, we also partner with technology providers to develop viable business projects for transforming biomass from agriculture, municipalities, the paper industry, or wood processing into bioliquids to be used for greener fuels and chemicals.\n\nProject commissioning is scheduled for March 2024 after finalizing integration with IT systems and preparing operation manuals.\n\n#### **Hydrogen**\n\nTogether with our partner Kommunalkredit Austria AG, in February 2021, we announced a joint investment in the construction of Austria's largest electrolysis plant at our Schwechat refinery. Construction work started on this project in August 2022. Total investment will be around EUR 25 mn, with OMV and Kommunalkredit each bearing half the cost. The plant is expected to go live in the first half of 2024. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis system will produce up to 1,500 t of green hydrogen per year. The green hydrogen will be used to hydrogenate biobased and fossil fuels, substituting gray hydrogen in the refinery. This would reduce OMV's carbon footprint by up to 15 kta of fossil CO2. On global wind day on June 15, 2023, a new milestone was accomplished where the first wind turbine assigned to OMV in Dürnkrut, Weinviertel was inaugurated. This wind turbine was built and is operated by our partner, the W.E.B. energy company. The wind turbine has a capacity of 5.6 MW and generates 13.7 GWh of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the annual consumption of 4,000 households. It will cover about 20% of the renewable energy needed for the 10 MW electrolysis plant in Schwechat.\n\n#### **Sustainable Aviation Fuels**\n\nWith the innovative aviation fuel known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), we're driving the transition to a climate-friendly future. Because by also processing waste food oil from around the region, CO2 emissions can be cut by more than 80% compared with conventional kerosene products. SAF is thus a viable alternative and already in use today.\n\nOMV has initiated a broad investment portfolio to produce sustainable fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). Mandated blending targets for both road fuels (HVO) and the aviation sector (SAF) are planned, with financial penalties for noncompliance. OMV is aiming to produce both SAF and HVO in a flexible product yield range, depending on market needs. Investments in new units and unit revamps are under development for the refineries in Austria, Romania, and Germany, as well as in new assets beyond the current refineries.\n\nAnother focus topic is the hard to electrify area of e-fuels, another core building block of OMV's SAF portfolio, which shows great potential for enabling climate-friendly air travel. While in theory the concept is simple, i.e., hydrogen produced with renewable electricity is combined with CO2, the production technology is still in the demonstration phase and requires further research and development for the required industrial scaling.\n\nOMV is leading a project consortium together with industrial partners like BASF and thyssenkrupp Uhde, and academia (e.g., the German Aerospace Centre DLR and ASG Analytik-Service Gesellschaft) to develop a process to produce SAF based on methanol (M2SAF project). In addition to catalyst development, process development, plant integration, and the design of a demo plant, the project also includes techno-economic and -ecological analysis, as well as accompanying support for the certification and analysis of the new aviation fuels. The project is also targeting the production of a 100% drop-in capable SAF and enabling a process route with high selectivity and minimal additional CO2 emissions, and with a high degree of integrability into existing brownfield or greenfield installations. The starting point of the process is sustainably produced methanol, either from CO2 and hydrogen or from biogenic feedstock. The development project started in August 2022 for an initial period of 2.5 years\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nand is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV).\n\nOMV was already delivering SAFs to Air France-KLM, Ryanair, and Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG Fuels) at Vienna airport in 2023. Additional Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for the intended offtake of SAFs were signed with Air France-KLM and Ryanair in 2023. Volumes covered by MoUs between 2023 and 2030 are: up to 160,000 t for Ryanair, up to 155,000 t for Wizz Air, up to 200,000 t for Air France-KLM, and more than 800,000 t for the Lufthansa Group.\n\n#### **Retail 2023**\n\nMobility is changing fast – countries in the EU have released climate and energy strategies, aiming for a carbon-free\n\n#### **Retail 2023**\n\nenergy sector by 2050. The vision addresses all energy sectors; mobility is being presented as a flagship sector to showcase sustainable development. To adapt to these trends, OMV is developing an EV fast-charging network.\n\nOMV is investing over EUR 400 mn in delivering superior EV charging services for drivers and businesses. Our objective is to offer at least 2,000 e-charging points at highway and transit route filling stations, plus around 17,000 office wall-box charging points by 2030. The implementation includes the installation of charging points in Austria, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary to offer highpower chargers, with the majority featuring a charging capacity between 150 kW and 300 kW. In 2023, an additional 272 charging points were installed.\n\nImage /page/64/Figure/10 description: This image shows a map of Europe with the number of filling stations, hydrogen filling stations, and e-charging points in each country. The map includes countries such as Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Serbia, and Bulgaria. The number of filling stations is shown in a white circle with a blue outline, the number of hydrogen filling stations is shown in a green circle, and the number of e-charging points is shown in an orange circle. The total number of filling stations is 1,666, the total number of hydrogen filling stations is 5, and the total number of e-charging points is 276. The number of filling stations in each country is as follows: Czech Republic (138), Slovakia (104), Austria (437), Hungary (207), Romania (555), Moldova (69), Serbia (63), and Bulgaria (93). The number of hydrogen filling stations in Austria is 5. The number of e-charging points in each country is as follows: Czech Republic (28), Slovakia (4), Austria (106), Hungary (22), Romania (120), and Austria (4).\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\n- In the coming years, we will focus on implementing the investment projects mentioned (e.g., Glycerin2Propanol). In Q3 2024 and subsequently to commissioning and start-up, vigorous test runs will be conducted according to a dedicated parameter matrix to further optimize the operating window of the Glycerin2Propanol process, and data will be gathered in parallel for subsequent industrial scale commercialization. Moreover, ISCC EU certification is planned for the Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant.\n- In addition, we will mature project ideas in the areas of advanced biofuels and e-fuels. By 2030, we aim to produce and market at least 700 kta of sustainable aviation fuels. OMV will also expand its capabilities to take advantage of the growth in electric vehicle charging. By investing more than EUR 400 mn by 2030, OMV will offer more than 2,000 electric charging points at highway and transit route filling stations, plus around 17,000 office wall-box charging points. In addition, following the MoU signed by the OMV Group and Austrian Post in 2021 for the use of green hydrogen in heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), the first use of green hydrogen is expected in 2023 at the latest. By 2030, 2,000 HGVs will be powered by green hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/1 description: The image contains three icons. The first icon is a print icon inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n- For the Glycerin2Propanol project, the factory acceptance test was completed in Q2 2023 and the pilot plant modules have been transported to the Schwechat refinery for reassembly, loop checks, and final commissioning by the end of 2024's first quarter. In parallel and as a precondition for the bulk chemical market, the propanol from OMV's biobased process has been registered at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) – OMV being the first company to register propanol produced from a renewable basis. Looking to the future, collaborative R&D efforts have begun to transform the propanol into sustainable aviation fuel.\n- Investments of approximately EUR 5 bn have been planned between now and 2030 to build the Low Carbon Business (LCB) in our Energy division, with a focus on geothermal energy, CCS, and renewable power. The investments are expected to ramp up after 2024. The LCB team has been working on expanding our renewables asset base with a focus on captive use within the OMV Group. Furthermore, we are looking at opportunities and projects to explore and commercially develop the geothermal energy potential via open- and closed-loop systems. For CCS, we are working on further license applications and opportunities.\n\n## Neutralization Measures\n\nWe aim to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero by 2050 at the latest. While the biggest drivers on this journey will be decreasing our fossil fuel sales and increasing our zerocarbon product sales, we also recognize that neutralization measures will be necessary. Neutralization measures include, but are not limited to, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). By 2030, we aim to establish CCS capacities of around 5 mn t per year as our main neutralization measure toward achieving our targets.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Offsetting Emissions**\n\nOMV offers voluntary carbon offsetting to customers and works closely with ClimatePartner, an internationally trusted service partner based in Munich. ClimatePartner selects certified carbon offset projects and ensures that OMV customers who use this option are able to contribute a dedicated amount to these projects. The criteria for these carbon offset credits to be used for voluntary offsetting are clearly defined in OMV's GHG Management Framework. In 2023, the biggest contributors in terms of CO2 offsets in OMV's portfolio were wind and solar energy projects in India and China, and forest protection in Brazil. In 2023, the climate protection projects used for CO2 offsetting consisted of: hydropower projects (14.38%) in Bulgaria, Turkey, India, and China; solar projects (9.13%) in China and India; wind energy projects (46.26%) in Bulgaria, Turkey, China, and India; nature-based projects\n\n(18.35%) in Rumania and Brazil; gas/heat recovery and biogas projects (11.9%) in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Pakistan. These carbon offsets are verified according to one or more of the following internationally recognized standards: Gold Standard (GS), Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Certified Emission Reductions (CER), and Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standard (CCBS).\n\nNone of these voluntary carbon offsets have been accounted to contribute toward achieving OMV's GHG reduction target.\n\n#### **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Utilization (CCU)**\n\nIn line with the aim of becoming a net-zero company, OMV will invest in carbon capture and storage (CCS), leveraging existing assets and capabilities, and contribute to a more sustainable society.\n\nIn order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, OMV Energy will invest around EUR 5 bn in the development of lowcarbon businesses, i.e., geothermal energy, renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS). For CCS, we intend to offset absolute emissions both from captive use and third parties. The target for 2030 is to grow to 5 mn metric t a year. We will explore CCS solutions based on our subsurface knowledge, capabilities, and asset base. In addition to the license that we hold together with Aker BP, we are working on further license applications and opportunities in this area. We collaborate on these activities in line with applicable regulatory and legal requirements in conjunction with industry and research partners.\n\nOMV aims to capture CO2 and ideally use it as a resource. Carbon capture and utilization technologies, such as capturing biogenic CO2 emissions, hydrating the CO2, and then reusing it as a chemical or aviation fuel, are crucial to reducing overall atmospheric emissions and fostering circularity. However, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement does not just require reducing our own emissions but also helping reduce atmospheric emissions from other sources. Thus, our CCS and CCU projects include, but are not limited to, capturing our own emissions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**327 kt CO2e** of customer-related GHG emissions voluntarily offset by verified carbon credits\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- Currently, OMV's customers can voluntarily offset the carbon footprint resulting from using all products they purchase from us, such as diesel, gasoline, bitumen, heating oil, and natural gas. OMV GAS offers this service in all markets. We recognize the high and ever-increasing customer demand for this option. OMV Fuels Sales customers can voluntarily offset their carbon footprint based on the use of gasoline or diesel, as well as extra-light heating oil and bitumen, in all countries where we operate. Customers of OMV Retail Mobility & Convenience (our filling stations) are able to offset 20% of the carbon footprint when opting for MaxxMotion Performance Fuels in Austria, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary, without any surcharge. Our OMV Card customers can use their OMV Card with the Routex function to offset the carbon footprint of the diesel and gasoline they purchase.\n- Aker BP and OMV (Norge) AS have entered into a collaboration agreement for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and been awarded a license for CO2 storage in accordance with the CO2 Storage Regulations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The license awarded to Aker BP and OMV is located in the Norwegian North Sea and is named Poseidon. Aker BP (50%) and OMV (Norge) AS (50%) have interest in the license, which will be operated by Aker BP. The license comes with a work program that includes a 3D seismic acquisition and a drill or drop decision by 2025. The Poseidon license could potentially provide storage of more than 5 mn t of CO2 per year. The intention is to inject CO2 captured from multiple identified industrial emitters in northwest Europe, including from Borealis' various industrial sites in Europe.\n\nBorealis entered into a collaboration with the University of Helsinki, Finland, as well as several other academic and industry partners, on a joint research project focusing on direct carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from the air. This project is part of the Business Finland-funded SPIRIT Program (Sustainable Plastics Industry Transformation). Co-founded by Borealis, the program seeks to bring about a circular and net zero transformation of the plastics value chain.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our strategy, we foresee developing CCS storage capacity of around 5 mn t per year CO2 net at OMV by 2030. In addition, OMV Petrom will test an innovative technology for CCU at the Petrobrazi refinery. OMV Petrom is a partner in an ambitious European project to address the problem of CO2 emissions through carbon capture and conversion technologies. Over a five-month period in 2024, they will capture the CO2 from flue gasses released by the cogeneration unit, further converting them electrochemically into a marketable product.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a blue circle.

In the foreground, there is a circular logo with a blue background and a white graphic of a plant growing from the soil, with arrows forming a recycling symbol around it.\n\n## Natural Resources Management\n\nOur impact on the environment – and responsibility to act – extends beyond our greenhouse gas emissions. As an oil, gas, and chemicals company, OMV's environmental footprint is significant due to its water use, environmental degradation caused by spills, biodiversity impacts, and waste. However, we also have the technological know-how to present solutions to reduce this impact, in particular by fostering the circular economy. In contrast to the linear \"take-make-waste\" model, which will lead to more plastic waste and environmental pollution while putting pressure on the planet's limited resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design and aims to decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources.\n\nOMV is fully committed to taking action when it comes to responsible natural resources management and is proactively expediting the transition from a linear to a circular economy. OMV aims to minimize environmental impacts by preventing water and soil pollution, reducing emissions, using natural resources efficiently, and avoiding the disruption of biodiversity.\n\nThe Natural Resources Management strategic focus area combines our commitments and actions relating to environmental preservation under one umbrella. The first step is to manage our operational footprint, as described in the Environment section below. The Circular Economy material topic then describes the strategies and technologies we are applying to recover and reuse by-products or waste to make new materials and products, resulting in a cleaner environment.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

OMV is liable for the impact that our activities have on the environment. Breaching environmental regulations on a local, national, and international level would result in both financial losses and harm to our reputation. Our license to operate depends on compliance with regulations relating to environmental protection, which is also of particular importance to governmental authorities, shareholders, and stakeholders such as the public and environmental NGOs and NPOs. OMV's Code of Conduct and HSSE Policy formalize our public commitments to safeguarding the environment.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/16 description: The image shows a circular blue icon with a white outline.

In 2020, the EM Standard was revised and minimum requirements on odor emissions were established. In 2021, the EM Standard was revised again, following which minimum requirements on H2S in vented gas and the design of the environmental processes to complement the implementation of the EM Standard were added. The review in 2022 resulted in the addition of two new annexes on a Water Management Plan Framework and Water Management Plan Template.\n\nBefore undertaking new operational activities or entering new countries, environmental risk assessments are performed, including evaluations of local legislation, the potential impact of our activities on sensitive and protected areas, and the effects on endangered species. Each subsequent phase of project implementation is accompanied by a detailed assessment of environmental risks.\n\nThe framework and methodology for our coordinated Groupwide Environmental Risk Assessment are based on best practice standards, which meet the ISO 14001 requirements and ensure the consistent qualitative assessment of operational risks and impacts related to the environment.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard furthermore defines the process of carrying out Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), mainly for projects. Preventive and mitigation measures and the monitoring program to ensure implementation of the proposed measures are documented in an Environmental and Social Management Plan. The final ESIA report is submitted to the local regulator or lender (whichever is applicable) for review, public disclosure, and approval.\n\n#### **52%** of sites certified to ISO 14001\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires that all relevant OMV businesses and activities (including investment, acquisitions, and divestment) implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) consistent with ISO 14001 and adhering to the minimum requirements listed. All relevant OMV businesses are required to review and update the EMS at least once per year, while a full EMS audit must be carried out either by an external independent auditor or OMV corporate environmental experts every three years for sites not certified to ISO 14001. Internal EMS audits are performed regularly and as necessary at local level to assess whether the guidelines in the EMS are being followed and to identify improvement measures.\n\nIn 2023, the utilization rate of the European refineries increased by 12% to 85% (2022: 73%), as the first half of the previous year was impacted by the turnaround and incident at the Schwechat refinery. The turnaround at the Petrobrazi refinery and the petrochemicals turnaround in Schwechat had a negative impact on the utilization rate in 2023. 14\n\nSeveral UN SDG subtargets were initially designated to be reached by 2020. However, sources such as the UN's Global Biodiversity Outlook state that goals related to nature have not been met. OMV still considers the attainment of these goals relevant past the year 2020, and thus still links these SDG subtargets to its strategic targets. 15\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThere is a high degree of interdependence between the Environment material topic and the material topics Health, Safety, and Well-Being, and Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience. Thus, these distinct material topics are governed centrally by Group HSSE. The OMV Group HSSE department is organized into specialized teams with experienced experts in areas such as:\n\n- Development and implementation of OMV's HSSE strategy, regulations, and processes\n- HSSE risk assessment\n- Incident investigation\n- HSSE data analysis and reporting\n- Environmental management\n- Process safety management\n- Security and resilience management\n\nGroup HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. There are HSSE departments at OMV Petrom and Borealis, which oversee their specific issues and coordinate their local HSSE officers and experts. The OMV Petrom and Borealis HSSE departments report functionally to the VP HSSE at Group level.\n\nEnvironmental awareness is promoted across the Group through various activities. For instance, regular exchanges on Environmental Management are held, where environmental experts and interested colleagues Group-wide can learn about the best practices being implemented at other sites and gain inspiration. At OMV Petrom, a contest to highlight key initiatives in the company was again held in 2023, with winners receiving awards from the OMV Petrom Executive Board.\n\n#### Strategy Update\n\nAs the OMV Group fundamentally updated its transformational business strategy in 2022, a major review of the HSSE Strategy 2025 led to the updated HSSE Strategy 2030. As pressure on the planetary boundaries continues to increase and substantial changes in the regulatory environment are taking place, environmental management will need a stronger and updated strategic focus in the coming years. More information on the strategy update can be found in Health, Safety, and Security.\n\n#### Water\n\nOMV uses significant amounts of water for its operations in its upstream and downstream activities. Freshwater is used for processes such as drilling, steam generation, and cooling, among others. Smaller amounts of water are also used for non-industrial purposes. Any water produced is treated for reinjection into pressurized hydrocarbon reservoirs to optimize the extraction rate. Desalinated water is used in some offshore operations. Refineries and various other operating facilities also use brackish and/or recycled water for various operational purposes. Some of OMV's operating facilities are located in water stress areas.<sup>16</sup>\n\n#### **Freshwater Withdrawn**<sup>17</sup>\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/19 description: The image is a bar graph showing freshwater withdrawn in megaliters from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, 39,251 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 185 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2020, 38,628 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 283 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2021, 333,247 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 348 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2022, 279,983 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 456 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2023, 154,573 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 1,525 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur Water Ambition Statement is OMV's public commitment to water management, and states the following:\n\n- We respect water as a precious limited resource and focus on its sustainable use.\n- We are committed to meeting all applicable legislative requirements or our own OMV regulations, whichever are more stringent.\n- Water management is a key component of our social license to operate. We cooperate with local communities and prove to be responsible partners.\n- We are committed to transparency when it comes to our impact on water resources.\n- Every OMV employee is responsible for minimizing the impact of our activities on water resources.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires all OMV businesses and activities to minimize the impact of effluent on the environment and on local communities and outlines specific requirements for wastewater discharge onshore and offshore. The direct discharge of wastewater on land, in wetlands, or in other bodies of water without prior treatment is not permitted. No discharge may alter or diminish the value of the receiving environment. Based on the national legislation and permits, all discharge must be systematically monitored, and any environmental impact must be managed appropriately. Local regulatory and river basin authorities are involved to ensure that OMV complies with local envi-\n\nAreas of water stress are areas where the demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period, or when poor quality restricts its use. In such areas, water stress causes deterioration of freshwater resources in terms of quantity (aquifer overexploitation, dry rivers, etc.) and quality (eutrophication, organic matter pollution, saline intrusion, etc.). Source: [European Environmental Agency.](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) 16\n\n<sup>17</sup> The decrease in freshwater withdrawn in 2023 vs. 2022 is due to the divestment of Borealis Nitro in 2023. The majority of freshwater withdrawn at Borealis is oncethrough cooling water, meaning it is discharged to the environment in its original quality, only with a very slightly elevated temperature. See [European Environmental](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) [Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) for details.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard was updated in 2022, with key additions being new annexes for the development and implementation of Water Management Plans.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV's Group-wide Water Strategy was drafted in 2014 and is based on five strategic pillars: transparency, risks and opportunities, water efficiency and treatment, training and awareness, and stakeholder engagement.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nHigh-level water stress assessments are conducted annually. In order to identify operations in areas affected by water scarcity and water stress, OMV uses international tools and indexes such as the Verisk Maplecroft Water Stress Index complemented by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Baseline Water Stress Index, and its own assessments as required. Some regions where OMV operates have already experienced water stress in dry years and a further decline in water availability is expected, mainly due to climate change.\n\nA bottom-up approach in the assessment of water-related risks is followed in accordance with OMV's Group-wide Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) guideline to ensure consistent qualitative assessments of operational risks and impacts related to the environment, including water. Significant risks are integrated into OMV's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) system. When entering a new country or considering new operational activities, OMV primarily uses the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tools and Verisk Maplecroft indices to identify future potential water-related constraints, such as baseline water stress, groundwater stress, and seasonal variability.\n\nWater management-related risks are closely linked with the topic of spill prevention. Offshore operations may lead to oil spills that have a significant impact on marine water resources and ecosystems. The response strategy aims to minimize the probability of such risks and maximize preparedness so that we can provide timely remediation measures in the unlikely event of an oil spill. OMV allocates significant resources to prevention and mitigation measures. Read more about spill prevention in the section [Spills](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2022/focus-areas/natural-resources-management/environment/spills.html). Any new or existing offshore drilling activity is accompanied by a third-party analysis evaluating the magnitude of a potential major event and its possible consequences. As part of the biannual Group-wide EWRM process, water-related risks and mitigation measures are assessed in a larger strategic context, while a systematic approach is taken in day-to-day operations to monitor and manage high-impact/low-probability risks, such as blowouts during offshore drilling.\n\n#### **Water Management Plans**\n\nWater Management Plans are an effective tool for addressing all water-related topics, issues, and tasks, with the aim of improving water management performance. They provide information about current water uses and chart a course for water efficiency improvements, conservation activities, and water reduction goals.\n\nEvery location in the OMV Group must develop, implement, and maintain a Water Management Plan, which should include at least the following elements:\n\n- Scope and objectives including site description\n- Applicable legislation, other requirements, and permits\n- Identification of water sources, discharges including water quality parameters, and monitoring plans\n- Water map, inventory, and balance including discharges\n- Water transport, storage, and treatment systems\n- Significant water-related risks and mitigation measures\n- Water conservation and water efficiency measures including an action plan\n\nOperating facilities located in places that are affected or are likely to be affected by water scarcity issues, and operations utilizing significant water resources (e.g., Tunisia) are prioritized when developing and implementing Water Management Plans. These plans aim to allow sustainable long-term production with minimal effects on the environment.\n\n#### **Best Available Technologies**\n\nWe implement measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal to a minimum. These include: reduction of operational complexity, water recirculation (e.g., at CCPP Brazi), upgrade of equipment (boilers), maintenance of equipment to reduce water loss, replacement of water cooling systems with air coolers (for example, the C3+ fraction recovery plant from Petromar), the use of desalinated seawater rather than freshwater, the installation of recirculating cooling systems, the use of air or glycol as a cooling agent instead of water (e.g., at Oltenia's 2 Bustuchin compressor station asset), and optimization of pipeline routes for water supply. In addition to implementing measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal, we implement the Best Available Technology (BAT) to sustainably treat water.\n\n#### **Stakeholder Engagement**\n\nOur impact on water resources is important to various stakeholders. We engage with government authorities, such as river basin management authorities, on compli-\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/1 description: The image shows three icons in a horizontal row. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside a circle. All icons are blue.\n\nance with water use rules and environmental parameters relating to any wastewater generated. We also engage with local water utility companies to discuss the supply of freshwater for OMV operations and the treatment of wastewater. We additionally work with NGOs on environmental preservation and water resource conservation, as well as with local communities on the sharing of local water resources and the quality of discharged wastewater. For instance, in Austria, there are local fisherpersons who fish the Danube in Schwechat, close to both the refinery and the Lobau Tank Farm, and in the harbor there, with whom we have maintained an active and open dialogue for several years. In areas where OMV operations require large amounts of water, or areas that suffer from water stress, it is particularly important to include local stakeholders in water management activities to secure a \"social license to operate.\" OMV's water management activities pursue socially equitable water use, and OMV regularly carries out supplier audits to ensure compliance with our human rights requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the interests of local communities are known and taken into account during the project life cycle, OMV conducts social baseline studies and community needs assessments as part of Social Impact Assessments (SIAs). If these assessments identify the need, OMV launches community projects aimed at increasing access to clean water for local communities. Our Community Grievance Mechanisms also enable communities to raise concerns about water-related issues. For more information, see Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\nWater Management Plans completed for **68%** of priority sites\n\n**1%** of freshwater withdrawal is in water scarce areas\n\n**0.012 mg/l** dispersed oil concentration in discharged water\n\nWater Management Plans have been completed for 68% of priority sites, with the development of plans in progress at the remaining sites. All plans are developed according to the new annexes of the OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard.\n\n- At OMV Tunisia, we implemented improvement projects to reduce freshwater use and increase the safe reuse of wastewater. To reduce freshwater use at the buffer firewater pit, we modified the outlet of our reverse osmosis unit and now use lower-quality retentate water for refilling instead of the previously used higher-quality well water. In order to safely reuse wastewater, we implemented downstream enhancements to the existing sewage water unit by installing additional sand filters and UV disinfection to act on pathogenic bacteria. This has enabled wider water reuse for the green zone irrigation and extension.\n- In 2023, Borealis put a new wastewater treatment plant in Stenungsund into operation. The new wastewater treatment unit is designed according to the BAT for this purpose and fulfills all legal requirements from the Swedish authorities. A new and modern wastewater treatment unit will improve the environmental performance of the cracker plant and reduce the environmental impact on the surroundings. The new wastewater treatment unit will reduce the emission of contaminants to the Baltic Sea and will also minimize VOC emissions to the air, since all treatment steps are covered and enclosed. The new unit includes buffering in two tanks and physical and chemical treatment of the water in dissolved nitrogen flotation units. The off-gas from the different steps will be treated by adsorption in carbon filters.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our Sustainability Strategy 2025, we aim to reduce freshwater use. As a next step, we plan to establish quantitative targets to improve water management. Over the coming years, the aim is for all operated OMV Group sites to have finalized and implemented their Water Management Plans.\n\n### Spills\n\nOil spills<sup>18</sup> are a critical environmental issue for our industry. Spill management is defined as the prevention of spills in operations and those caused by incidents such as sabotage or natural hazards, and the management and remediation of spills resulting from an incident. Our key commitment is to prevent spills from happening in the first place. If they do occur, we aim to reduce their impact through appropriate and fast oil spill response and clean-up.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups are affected by our spill management activities. Government authorities are involved through potential breaches of environmental regulations, while employees and contractors are impacted by potential health and safety issues arising from accidents and damage to the environment and society. NGOs/NPOs are interested in potential damage to the environment and society, society may suffer as a result of damage to the\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nsurrounding environment, and shareholders may have to deal with direct financial losses due to the costs of remediation measures and reputational damage.\n\nFurthermore, as OMV is diversifying, oil spills are no longer the only spills we need to deal with. For our subsidiary Borealis, preventing pellet spills is also a key issue. Borealis is committed to achieving zero pellet loss in and around its operations, during transportation, and across the entire value chain. The company was therefore an early signatory to Operation Clean Sweep® (OCS), an international program initiated by the Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council and rolled out in Europe by Plastics Europe. Borealis is also a signatory of the Zero Pellet Loss pact in Austria, which is the Austrian equivalent of OCS. Achieving zero pellet loss is an ongoing journey and requires leadership, effort, investment, and targeted and effective work practices. The following section will discuss our management of oil spills. Read more about our efforts on pellet spills in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/about-us/debt-investor-relations/results-and-reports)\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nWe aim to prevent and reduce oil spills and leakage in our operations at sea as well as on land. Appropriate spill prevention and control plans that account for specific business conditions have been put in place and are summarized in the Spill Preparedness and Response Planning annex of our Environmental Standard. These include proactive management plans comprising risk assessments, preventive measures, and inspections, as well as reactive management plans comprising control, response, and clean-up procedures. The majority of our oil spills involve OMV Petrom's Exploration & Production division, where we concentrate our efforts on safeguarding and maintaining our infrastructure and improving the reliability of our facilities.\n\n#### **Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments**\n\nWe have a Well Integrity Management System (WIMS) in place covering all active wells operated by OMV. WIMS enables a uniform and structured approach for describing, documenting, and reporting the status of the well integrity throughout the production phase of a well in a predefined operating envelope. WIMS therefore ensures that we operate our wells safely for people and the environment. OMV's Energy division has also developed a Corrosion Management Framework (CMF) to provide a proactive and consistent approach to corrosion monitoring and management across the entire division. Covering the full life cycle of the equipment exposed to the risk of corrosion in both oil and gas facilities, from the well to the sales point, this framework encompasses the entire value chain of our business. A team of dedicated in-house experts with multidisciplinary and multicultural backgrounds is working to embed CMF principles into everyday operations.\n\n#### **Emergency Response and Contingency Plans**\n\nWe conduct spill responses according to a plan that identifies appropriate resources (persons in charge and intervention materials) and expertise. This plan assists on-site personnel with dealing with spills by clearly setting out the responsibilities for the actions necessary to stop and contain the spill and to mitigate its effects. This includes techniques for preventing the spill from moving beyond the immediate site and collecting the spilled substance and contaminated material. Clear communication and coordination protocols are set out in the local plans, particularly where national or international response resources may be required. We carry out regular oil spill response drills and training.\n\n#### **Clean-up and Remediation**\n\nOil spills are assessed and cleaned up immediately after their occurrence in accordance with the Spill Preparedness and Response Planning Annex of our Environmental Standard. In particularly difficult cases, we rely on third-party support for capping and containment, surface clean-up, and emergency management. Leaks are repaired immediately or within defined time frames in accordance with the site's maintenance processes and based on the risk assessment outcome and other factors, such as feasibility of repair during operation. To strengthen our response to and reduce the environmental impact of oil spills, we continue to perform emergency drills, including pollution scenarios. We approach remediation measures in line with the relevant legal requirements, which include clean-up, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or replacement of damaged environmental receptors.\n\nWe ensure that the affected land is fit for the intended use by implementing remediation measures, including cleaning up spills (e.g., by excavation and clean earth filling) as well as relying on natural attenuation (recovery) based on the respective decision of the environmental authorities. Provisions are included in our accounts for the liabilities related to spills and cover cleaning and remediation costs.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Total volume of spills**\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/16 description: The image is a bar chart showing data from 2019 to 2023. The y axis is labeled 'In m3'. The value for 2019 is 56.6, for 2020 is 41.4, for 2021 is 81.0, for 2022 is 223.5, and for 2023 is 185.7.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nIn 2023, another significant spill occurred in the Exploration & Production division of OMV Petrom in Romania. Between June 4 and 5, 2023, an oil-water spill occurred downhill from a buried pumping pipeline connecting Park 11 to Tank Farm (TF) Independenta, Asset Moldova E&P. An agricultural area of 500 m<sup>2</sup> was affected. The Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) event lasted for around 20 hours, until Monday, June 5 (10 p.m.) when the pumping was stopped. Production measurement at the Tank Farm and calculations indicated an estimated loss of 200 m<sup>3</sup> gross oil-water volume (85 t oil and 100 m<sup>3</sup> produced water). Lessons learned from 2022 could not prevent this spill because of the specific design and age of the pipeline. The incident was thoroughly investigated in accordance with internal regulations and the root causes were identified. All recommendations raised address the technical upgrade of pipelines with an old design as well as updating the work instructions to prevent major consequences. All measures are in the implementation phase and lessons learned are being shared and discussed within the organization.\n\nThe majority of our spills occur at OMV Petrom. In 2023, the Pipeline Integrity Management Program in the Exploration & Production division continued, and the resulting actions were embedded in the Integrated Risk Register. A total of 31 pipeline projects were executed to show our commitment to this program. The Pipeline Inspection Program also witnessed the completion of a number of successful New Technology projects, resulting in the capacity to perform inspections that were not possible in the past. These new technologies are now part of our regular inspection options and will serve to enhance pipeline integrity in the future. In addition, OMV Petrom continues to reduce the number of kilometers of pipelines through several field optimization projects, which will reduce the risk of exposure by removing numerous aging pipelines while maintaining optimal production.\n\nThe Corrosion Management Plans developed over the past few years are now fully implemented and the remaining locations are being finalized. This has helped improve the integrity and longevity of our pipelines through cleaning, inspection, and introduction of inhibition chemicals, along with new corrosion monitoring techniques. In our offshore asset, a large maintenance optimization project was kicked off in 2023 that will ensure all the right maintenance is being performed at the optimal intervals. This review will conclude in 2024.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nEvery year, we assess any occurrences of spills and use any \"lessons learned\" as a basis for improving our process safety in the coming years. For the significant spill in Romania in 2023, lessons learned included reviewing the risk ranking of pipelines crossing environmentally sensitive areas, reviewing pipeline testing procedures, and reassessing the methodology for inspecting aging pipelines. In 2024, the OMV Group aims to prevent process safety events at all our sites across the globe, ultimately resulting in the reduction of spills. Read more in Process Safety.\n\n### Waste\n\nOur production activities generate solid and liquid waste, including hazardous waste such as oily sludge, waste chemicals, and catalysts. Examples of non-hazardous waste include excavated soil, as well as mixed municipal waste, paper, and metal.\n\nIn addition, as a producer of plastics, we are deeply aware of the issue of plastic waste. Too often, unmanaged plastic waste is dumped in unsanitary landfills or burned, therefore increasing the risk of leakage into waterways, lakes, or oceans and thus causing negative impacts on the environment, marine life, and, potentially, human health. This section of the Sustainability Report focuses on waste management in our operations. For more on end-of-life waste, please see the focus area Circular Economy.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nAccording to OMV's Environmental Management Standard, all OMV Group businesses and activities are required to identify and use the least hazardous material option and to minimize both the use of raw materials and the subsequent generation of waste. The following hierarchy is applied to controlling waste: prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, other recovery (e.g., energy recovery), and, lastly, disposal in a controlled manner. The disposal of liquids in landfills and the burning of solid and liquid materials in open burning pits or any other location are not permitted.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard further requires that environmental and social components be identified for the entire life cycle of facilities, including decommissioning and abandonment, so that any future adaptation measures can be identified and planned for. The needs of local communities, including indigenous peoples, are incorporated and addressed throughout all phases of the project life cycle, including during decommissioning or abandonment.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Application of Best Practices**\n\nInternational industry best practice is applied for the management and treatment of waste, including drilling waste. Where existing local, regional, or national waste management facilities are inadequate, OMV supports third parties in developing their capability.\n\n#### **Recycling**\n\nWaste is recovered and recycled where possible, including during site closure and decommissioning. If recycling is\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nnot possible, all waste is processed and/or disposed of only in licensed facilities or via reputable licensed contractors. Waste contractors are regularly audited.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Waste Recovery or Recycling Rate**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/7 description: The image is a line graph showing data from 2020 to 2023. The y-axis is labeled 'In %' and ranges from 30 to 80. The data points are as follows: In 2020, the value is 68. In 2021, the value is 68. In 2022, the value is 63. In 2023, the value is 74.\n\n- 81% of OMV's total waste comes from OMV Petrom. OMV Petrom continued to work on site restoration at the remaining five depots in Constanța, Zalău ANRS, Iaṣi, Oradea, and Găeṣti. At the Zalău ANRS, Oradea, and Găeṣti depots, the restoration works were finalized in 2023. Over the past few years, 42 former fuel terminals have already been restored, with sites having been remediated to initial preoperational state. In addition to the 249,575 m<sup>3</sup> of soil/subsoil contaminated with petroleum products generated and treated over previous years, around 53,372 m<sup>3</sup> of additional contaminated soil was treated in 2023. The treatment is performed using site-specific methods in line with best practice (e.g., bioremediation technologies off site and on site with injection). We achieved a recovery rate of 99% for the contaminated soil treated, which we then used for on-site backfills or directed to other authorized locations. We performed periodic monitoring during and after site rehabilitation, as requested for each site by environmental authorities. The site status (e.g., land covered by grass, soil compaction) is monitored quarterly for one year after our works are finalized. The decontamination work on the former petroleum products terminal in Constanța was carried out in close collaboration and alongside the archaeological research conducted by the Museum of National History and Archaeology Constanța (MINAC). This was done according to national legislation, and due to the site's high archaeological potential. During the archaeological survey, many artefacts of historical significance were also discovered.\n- To celebrate World Environment Day (WED), which takes place annually on June 5, OMV Tunisia launched the #BeatPlasticPollution campaign in Gabès and the south of Tunisia where it operates. Some 25 people from corporate volunteering, including members of the OMV Tunisia leadership team, were present at the beach in Gabès to participate in the \"Run and Plog\" activities jointly organized by OMV and other public sector institutions and local non-government organizations. Participants engaged in a plastic waste collection rally. The Gabès coastline is home to a vulnerable ecosystem in the Mediterranean with increased interest in preserving marine biodiversity (e.g., endangered turtle species). From Gabès, we moved to our sites in the desert of Tataouine. Another cleaning campaign was held in the heart of the desert, where Waha CPF, Nawara CPF field teams, and contractors gathered to pick up littered plastic. Two permanent containers were also placed on the road to allow travelers to dispose of plastic bottles in an adequate way.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our Sustainability Strategy 2025, we plan to increase the reuse and recycling of waste from operations. Over the coming year, we plan to review the Waste Management Plans across the OMV Group.\n\n#### Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity supports human and societal needs, including food and nutrition security, energy, development of medicines and pharmaceuticals, freshwater, and clean air, which together underpin good health. It also supports economic opportunities and leisure activities that contribute to our overall well-being. Biodiversity conservation provides substantial benefits, such as clean, consistent water flows, protection from floods and storms, and a stable climate. The loss of biodiversity is perilous, and its consequences are immediate.\n\nIn December 2022, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted with the objective of taking urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, thereby putting nature on a path to recovery by 2030. Accordingly, the EU's biodiversity strategy for 2030, which is a comprehensive, ambitious, and long-term plan to protect nature and reverse the degradation of ecosystems, aims to put Europe's biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030 and contains specific actions and commitments.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group is committed to preserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems in alignment with the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the EU's biodiversity strategy. The OMV Group's Environ-\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/76/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nmental Management Standard and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure state that all OMV activities must be conducted in such a way as to cause minimal disturbance to protected areas and to local flora and fauna.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nObserved or predicted direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) are described and analyzed in environmental impact assessments. Through these impact assessments, the presence of nationally or globally endangered species and nationally or internationally recognized protected areas are identified.\n\n#### **Biodiversity Management Plans**\n\nOMV is in contact with Ipieca's Biodiversity Task Force, which issued a guide on how to develop biodiversity action plans in 2022. OMV aims to develop Biodiversity Management Plans based on this guide for all operations and projects where significant risks are identified.\n\n#### **Mitigation and Rehabilitation**\n\nIn the event of significant observed or predicted impacts, we apply the mitigation hierarchy, and action planning gives priority to avoidance and minimization over the restoration and offsetting of the impact. Mitigation measures include, for example, the rerouting of pipelines or scheduling projects during seasons when the impact on breeding populations can be avoided.\n\nAn example of good practice in biodiversity management can be taken from the Berling development project (formerly Iris Hades) in offshore Norway. The aim was to avoid any damage to sensitive cold-water coral. Building on available know-how and technology, biodiversity screening and baseline studies were executed as part of the environmental impact assessment. The mitigation hierarchy was applied by selecting the well location, template location, and pipeline routing as far away as possible from any coral colonies. The best available technologies were utilized to minimize any impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, OMV Petrom continued the cleaning, remediation, and ecological reconstruction works for five former fuel terminals (for more information, see [Waste\\)](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2022/focus-areas/natural-resources-management/environment/waste.html). During this project, we performed periodic monitoring during and after site rehabilitation, as requested for each site by the environmental authorities. Examples of this monitoring include taking samples of soil/subsoil and checking the groundwater in each phase of the project (e.g., excavation, bioremediation). This is carried out on a quarterly basis for one year after our work is finalized.\n\n#### **Working with Third Parties**\n\nOMV works locally with third parties on restoration and rehabilitation projects. For example, in 2023, we supported the following biodiversity-related projects in New Zealand as part of our wider Stakeholder Engagement and Corporate Social Responsibility portfolio. New Zealand has the highest number of threatened indigenous species in the world.<sup>19</sup>\n\n- Partnership with Ngāti Koata and the Department of Conservation for the Moawhitu lake and wetland regeneration project\n- Partnership with the Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust, creating a predator-free reserve in South Taranaki, thereby protecting the endemic hihi bird (stitchbird) in this reserve located just outside of New Plymouth\n- Partnership with the local hapū at Pohokura to restore and protect the wetlands on site\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n- We initiated a Group-wide project to establish a nature and biodiversity framework for the OMV Group, as part of which we are applying the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD) Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare (LEAP) approach to identify priority sites, evaluate impacts and dependencies, assess risks and opportunities, and prepare to respond to nature-related risks and opportunities and to report on material nature-related issues.\n- We again took steps to prevent impacts on sensitive species and ecosystems. For instance, during our exploration activities at the Wittau site in Austria, a range of technologies were used to mitigate impacts on insects and birds as much as possible. As the target location was positioned below a sensitive area, we moved the drill site to a less sensitive place and applied directional drilling technology. Insect-friendly lighting was used during the whole drilling operation. For well testing, enclosed incinerators were used instead of open flares to minimize disturbance to the local ecosystem.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, we plan to apply the TNFD LEAP approach to all our operated sites (excluding filling stations) and develop the processes for consistent biodiversity management in our operated sites. Subsequently, we plan to extend the scope to value chain impacts. In 2024, OMV will also continue supporting local biodiversity initiatives such as the Ngāti Koata and the Department of Conservation for the Moawhitu lake and wetland regeneration project, and the partnership with the Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust in New Zealand.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n## Non-GHG Air Emissions\n\nExposure to air pollution can affect everyone's health. It is the greatest environmental threat to public health globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued stricter recommendations on safe air pollution levels in a bid to curb the millions of premature deaths and loss of millions more healthy years of life caused by air pollution.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard stipulates that all OMV Group businesses and activities must understand the impacts of their air emissions on local and regional ambient air quality. Air emissions are required to be monitored, controlled, and minimized in order to mitigate the potential effects on human health and harm to the environment. There are strong legal requirements surrounding air emissions in the EU, which is where all our refineries are located. For instance, the EU does not permit the use of fuels containing sulfur to prevent transport-related SOx emissions. Sulfur has a significant impact on health, for example sulfur dioxide affects the respiratory system, particularly lung function, and can irritate the eyes. It causes coughing and mucus secretion and aggravates conditions such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Monitoring**\n\nIn all our refineries, we monitor emissions of pollutants such as sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter/dust, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) as required by European and national legislation and the respective permits. If emissions are found to be in excess of nationally prescribed limits and/or limits defined in a permit, additional monitoring stations are installed, and measures are implemented. For example, in OMV Tunisia, pollutant emissions from combustion processes such as NOx or CO have caused great public concern due to their impact on health and the environment. The past decade has witnessed rapid changes both in the regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions and in the technologies used to meet these regulations. Monitoring of these emissions is typically performed with a Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), which is a packaged system of gas analyzers necessary for the determination of gases and particles to stay within Tunisian emissions regulations. Because of this, we installed a pollutant analyzer on the turbines at GTP.\n\n#### **Prevention and Treatment**\n\nOMV has long implemented technologies to reduce emissions, such as installing end-of-pipes, abatement technologies, and floating roofs to reduce emissions of VOCs. Over the past years, we have focused on upgrading such technologies to ensure that they are still effective and reducing emissions. For instance, a SNOx flue gas cleaning plant at the Schwechat refinery was commissioned. With the SNOx Refurbishment of Wet Sulfuric Acid (WSA) program, in which a solution patented by OMV (two-layer PFA film structure with monitoring system) was implemented, both the reliability and the availability of the flue gas cleaning system could be increased. The flue gas cleaning plant at the Schwechat refinery is used for the removal of dust, and for denitrification and desulfurization of flue gases from the two power plants before they are emitted via the stack. As a first process step, dust is separated via electrostatic precipitators. During selective catalytic reduction, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are converted into free nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) by injecting ammonia (NH3). In the third step, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is oxidized with the aid of a catalyst and reacts with residual moisture to form gaseous sulfuric acid. Finally, the sulfuric acid is condensed in the WSA by means of air cooling and heat recovery. The sulfuric acid obtained in this way is then either sold or used for pH adjustment within the refinery. By applying these process steps, 98% of dust can be separated, more than 96% of sulfur can be recovered, and around 95% of NOx emissions can be prevented. With the catalyst update, a NOx reduction rate of around 95% is now achievable again. At other emissions sources at the Schwechat refinery, we continued our work on reducing emissions to air. The installation of a fourth electrical field at the existing electrostatic precipitator of the FCC plant aided the significant reduction of dust emissions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n- In Norway, we included the reduction of emissions to air in our drilling operations by incentivizing emissions reduction measures in our drilling contracts. As a result, in the Velocette drilling campaign, selective catalytic reduction was installed at the engine exhausts to reduce NOx emissions by approximately 74%.\n- In 2023, Borealis put a wastewater treatment plant in Stenungsund into operation. The new wastewater treatment unit will reduce the emission of contaminants to the sea and will also minimize VOC emissions to the air, since all treatment steps are covered and enclosed. The new unit includes buffering in two tanks and physical and chemical treatment of the water in Dissolved Nitrogen Flotation (DNF) units. The off-gas from the different steps will be treated by adsorption in carbon filters.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n- OMV Petrom continues to restore sites as it has done previously for former fuel terminals or abandoned facilities. The best practices applied include the use of a water spray curtain, dust protection nets, forced ventilation, off-site bioremediation of the most heavily contaminated soil, and periodic communication with the community and the authorities. In periods of strong wind, OMV Petrom always minimizes dust-producing activities, wets surfaces more thoroughly, and covers the surfaces of on-site biopiles. This subsequently reduces the impact on the air quality. Regarding odor and dust control during soil excavation and transport, OMV Petrom has optimized transportation routes to minimize disturbance to the community, and always secures loads and cleans the wheels at the site exit to avoid the contamination of public roads, and sprinkles the access roads on site.\n- In OMV Petrom R&M, the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program in accordance with BAT Reference Documents (BREF) continued to be carried out at the Petrobrazi refinery. The objective of this program is to reduce fugitive emissions from the plant's technical equipment (e.g., vents, flanges). We continued the program, targeting accessible fugitive emissions sources from coking, the catalytic reforming complex, catalytic cracking and GASCON units, as well as the tank park including the screening of inaccessible sources. 48% of the leakages identified could be fixed. The program will run periodically, according to a schedule, in all Petrobrazi installations.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2021, we launched a pilot project to develop an Odor Management Plan for one representative facility at an E&P asset of OMV Petrom. Due to legal uncertainties, the pilot project could not be finalized in 2023. As soon as requirements are clear, we will finalize the development and implementation of the Odor Management Plan.\n\n## Circular Economy\n\n#### **Material Topic: Circular Economy**\n\nDecoupling economic growth from resource depletion by recovering and reusing products or waste to make new materials and products, such as recycled or biobased polyolefins\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\n- GRI 306: Waste 2020\n\nGRI 306: Waste 2020 Environmental concerns\n\n### **Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/14 description: The image shows four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).\n\nThe OMV Group believes that transitioning to a circular economy will significantly reduce its impact on the environment and its GHG emissions. A circular economy decouples economic growth from resource depletion by keeping materials, resources, and products in circulation and by preventing the leakage of these resources into the environment as much as possible, particularly into the oceans and landfill sites. Transitioning from a linear \"takemake-waste\" economy to a circular \"reduce-reuse-recycle\" economy will also help curb global warming. Through the efficient use of precious resources, it is possible to recover and reuse by-products or waste by transforming them into new materials and products. This approach has the potential to greatly decrease associated emissions along product value chains.\n\nIn addition to recycling plastic waste and reusing it to make new materials and products, the OMV Group also sees plastics based on renewable feedstock as playing a key role in the circular economy. The use of renewable feedstock lowers the demand for fossil feedstock and considerably decreases carbon footprints. The OMV Group focuses on utilizing waste biomass, such as residual forestry matter that is not in competition with the food and feed chain, and thus does not require the use of additional natural resources such as land or water. If then recycled,\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house has a simple, triangular roof and a rectangular body with a vertical line representing a door. The circle is also blue and has a thin outline.\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer, the second is a left arrow, and the third is a right arrow.\n\nsuch second-generation bioplastics can play a vital role in a sustainable, circular economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on two fronts, cutting emissions in the input and in the end-of-life phase.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/4 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Sustainable polyolefins production capacity In kt\". The x-axis shows the years 2022, 2023, 2025, and 2030. The y-axis shows the production capacity. In 2022, the production capacity is 148.5. In 2023, the production capacity is 195.9. In 2025, the production capacity is 614.0. In 2030, the production capacity is ~2,000. The graph also includes a legend that shows the different types of recycling: Mechanical Recycling, Chemical Recycling, and Biobased.\n\nThe creation of a truly circular economy also has wider societal implications. It will provide economic benefits to society by reducing the major financial burden of ineffective waste management systems and pollution management, and will create new business opportunities and employment at various stages along the value chain. A circular economy will also result in better living and working conditions, and an overall cleaner environment.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of a majority share in the polyolefins producer Borealis in 2020 and the consolidation of Borealis into the C&M segment within OMV, circular economy is now a cornerstone of the OMV Group's Strategy 2030. By 2030, the aim is to establish a production capacity of 2 mn t of sustainable polymers and chemicals per year, i.e., polyolefin products or other chemicals derived from plastic waste (either through a mechanical or chemical recycling process) or from biobased feedstock. In parallel, the use of fossil fuels will decrease, as the aim is to reduce oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and reduce crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t by 2030. These fossil fuels would ordinarily also be used to make polymers; instead, more polymers will be based on recycled waste or renewable resources such as biobased feedstock. In 2023, the OMV Group established a production capacity of 195.9 kt of sustainable (including recycled and biobased) polyolefins and other chemicals.\n\n| Target 2025        | Establish production capacity of 600 kta sustainable<br>(including recycled and biobased) polyolefins and other<br>chemicals                 |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target 2030        | Establish production capacity of approximately 2,000 kta<br>sustainable (including recycled and biobased) polyolefins<br>and other chemicals |\n| Status 2023        | Production capacity of 195.9 kta established                                                                                                 |\n| Most relevant SDGs |                                                                                                                                              |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**8.4** Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavor to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programs on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead\n\n**9.4** By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities\n\n**12.5** By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\n\n**14.1** By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThrough its subsidiary Borealis, the OMV Group is promoting the circular economy across the industry by launching initiatives and participating in activities and platforms that drive recycling options and solutions. Borealis is a core partner in the New Plastics Economy (NPEC), a member of the EU's Circular Plastics Alliance, and, as a member of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, supports the development of the UN treaty to end plastic pollution.\n\nThe OMV Group's goal is to take on a leading position in the circularity of plastics and to offer its customers innovative solutions that advance the circular economy. In order to transition to a truly circular and carbon-neutral economy, a variety of solutions will be required to keep products circulating at their highest value, quality, and utility over many lifetimes. This can only be achieved by using a full suite of different, complementary technologies that come into play in a cascading way. This integrated approach is embodied in the Circular Cascade Model.\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/5 description: The image shows a circular diagram of a polyolefin production and recycling process. The diagram starts with three inputs: \"Base chemicals from direct carbon capture\", \"Renewable feedstock\", and \"Fossil feedstock\", all of which lead to a \"Base chemical producer\". The output of this producer goes to a \"Polyolefin producer\". From there, the process moves to \"Use Reuse\", which is represented by a landscape with trees and water. The next step is \"Use Reuse\", followed by \"End product\", and then \"Waste collecting and sorting\". The diagram then splits into two recycling paths: \"Mechanical Recycling\" and \"Chemical Recycling\", both of which lead back to the \"Polyolefin producer\". The diagram also includes \"Design for Eco-Efficiency\" and \"Design for Recycling\" as key considerations in the process.\n\n#### **Design for Eco-Efficiency**\n\nThis means adopting a fundamental design mindset that starts with minimizing the use of resources during production and maximizing the product's lifetime value. Borealis' foam business is a prime example of eco-efficient polyolefin solutions. This business line is used in industries such as packaging, sports, transportation, and construction, and helps facilitate the transition to a circular economy as it is especially suited to ultra-lightweight foam applications while being fully recyclable.\n\nIn 2023, Borealis increased its participation in Bockatech EcoCore®, a patented manufacturing technology for foamed articles that uses Borealis' HMS (high melt strength) polypropylene. The aim is to enable a greater number of global customers, value chain partners, and supply chain players to benefit from a broader range of lighter foam-based applications, primarily in the packaging sector.\n\n#### **Reuse**\n\nReuse is a core element of circularity, as circular change starts first with reduction and reuse, before recovery and recycling close the loop. This step aims to maximize and extend the lifetime of products that are already in circulation. This will be fostered by leveraging knowledge of plastic use and processing, and by establishing systems and business models designed to encourage reuse.\n\nPartnerships are vital for broadening knowledge about reuse activities and ensuring sustainable growth. In 2023, Borealis further strengthened its commitment to the reuse principle by engaging in several collaborative projects with value chain partners. For example, Borealis joined the 4everPack consortium, a two-year research program run by the Finnish institute VTT and funded by Business Finland. The project aims to replace the linear economy with a fully circular model, focusing on the reusable packaging value chain. Borealis will provide its know-how and expertise in\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body.\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ninnovative material and packaging design for the selected reuse systems.\n\n#### **Design for Recycling**\n\nA key challenge in increasing the recycling of plastics is that many products are not intentionally designed for recycling in the first place. For example, flexible packaging often uses layers of different materials, which makes separating and recycling the plastic content extremely difficult. The challenge is to create packaging that uses only a single material, while maintaining or even improving performance. Thus, Design for Recyclability (DfR) emphasizes that a product must be designed with the intention that it can be easily collected, sorted, and recycled. DfR is an important aspect of eco-efficient design and takes a life cycle approach by carefully and intelligently balancing the production, use, and after-use phases of a product.\n\nInspired by the EU Commission's vision for increased levels of recycling, brand owners worldwide are committing to developing 100% recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging solutions by 2025. To further DfR, Borealis developed and actively promotes its 10 Codes of Conduct for polyolefin packaging designers. These help designers develop packaging materials that can be successfully recycled and used again, either for the same application or in other products. The Codes are being incorporated into assessment methodologies for recyclability, for example in future modulated Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines for packaging.\n\nBorealis also applies its innovation activities to offer alternatives to materials and material combinations that are not recyclable today and collaborates with value chain partners to expand its range of fully recyclable, mono-material solutions. At the Plastics Recycling Show Europe 2023, Borealis launched a new mono-material pouch containing over 95% polypropylene (PP), which is fully designed for mechanical recycling. This could help meet the ambitious recycling and waste reduction targets set out in the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, as well as ecomodulation criteria for EPR programs.\n\nBorealis is an active member of the HolyGrail 2.0 (HG 2.0) digital wan already to more than 170 members, including over 40 brand owners and retailers. This initiative, which is driven by the AIM (European Brands Association) and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, is a pilot project working to prove the technical viability of digital watermarks (i.e., almost imperceptible postage stampsized codes on the packaging) for the accurate sorting of packaging waste as well as to prove the economic viability of the business case on a large scale. In 2023, digital watermarking initiative Holy Grail 2.0 entered the final phase of research and development trials to validate the technology\n\nat the highest technical level and prepare it for market entry. Borealis will perform recycling tests on the PP film and polyethylene flexibles generated by the sorting trials conducted by Hündgen Entsorgung, who is using the packaging volumes put on the market by Holy Grail 2.0 brand company members in Germany and Denmark.\n\n#### **Closing the Loop**\n\nThe potential for product reuse also has its limits. This is when the steps of recovery and recycling come into play in the circular cascade model in order to close the loop on plastic waste. The OMV Group is fully committed to broadening the range of circular products. It therefore ranks the development of mechanical and chemical recycling equally, as they are seen as complementary to each other. The Group's ambitions in the area of mechanical recycling lie with its subsidiary Borealis, which continues to work with partners to develop new technologies for mechanical recycling, with the objective of delivering products with near-virgin quality where possible, and with the lowest carbon footprint (read more in Mechanical Recycling).\n\nChemical recycling can extract value from residual waste streams from mechanical recycling and mixed plastic waste streams, which would otherwise be sent to landfill or be incinerated. This process involves changing the chemical composition of the plastic. The resulting synthetic pyrolysis oil can then be used again to make any type of plastic or product. Since it is practically comparable to virgin plastics, it can also serve a more diverse field of applications (read more in Chemical Recycling).\n\nThere is rising demand for both high-quality recyclates and product-based solutions for renewable feedstocks. The OMV Group is committed to supporting producers and brand owners in meeting environmental and regulatory challenges and is therefore continuously developing its circular and renewable product offering. The wide range of mechanically recycled products falls under the Borcycle™ M umbrella, and chemically recycled product solutions are in the Borcycle™ C portfolio. Borealis also offers and markets circular polyolefin products based on renewable feedstock: Bornewables™(read more in Renewable Feedstock).\n\nBorvida™ represents the portfolio of circular base chemicals. Borvida B, from non-food waste biomass, and Borvida C, from chemically recycled plastic waste, are the first products in the portfolio. In the future, it will be expanded to include Borvida A, from atmospheric carbon capture.\n\nThe OMV Group is also committed to reducing plastic leakage. In 2017, Borealis initiated Project STOP (Stop Ocean Plastics) in Indonesia. Co-founded with SYSTEMIQ, this program aims to achieve zero leakage of waste into\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nthe environment and increase plastics recycling. Project STOP focuses on the regions with the highest leakage rates and, with the support of industry and government partners, works hand in hand with cities to create leak-free, low-cost, and more circular waste management systems (read more in Community Investments and on the [Project](https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/en_gb/) [STOP website](https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/en_gb/)).\n\n## Governance\n\nThe circular economy has been on the OMV Group's agenda since 2015, and has become even more important since the acquisition of a majority share in Borealis in 2020. Several aspects of the circular economy, in particular mechanical and chemical recycling, are now jointly being developed further.\n\nWith the new Strategy 2030, which was introduced in March 2022, OMV emphasized once again the importance of a circular economy for a sustainable chemicals business going forward. This is the reason why the OMV Group plans to implement a fundamental strategic shift from a linear toward a circular business approach. The C&M business segment will act as the growth engine of the Company. It is to be substantially strengthened, expanded, and diversified, with the aim of developing into a leader in high-quality polyolefin solutions, as well as renewable and circular chemicals and materials. In order to implement this strategy, a new target operating model was defined. This new organization came into effect in 2023 and forms the backbone of the strategy execution.\n\nThe C&M segment continues to cover the entire chemicals value chain, including responsibility for capturing value from the circular economy. As one of the focus areas in the C&M segment, Circular Economy forms a separate business unit. This unit covers business development activities, as well as activities related to circular feedstock.\n\nThe department covering the further development of OMV's ReOil® technology is now allocated to the new corporate unit Innovation & Technology, and with that has moved into the direct responsibility of OMV's CEO. Among other things, the new licensing business will also be managed by a separate department within this unit in order to license sustainable technologies developed by OMV to the wider industry. The establishment of a dedicated corporate function focusing on innovation and technology under the leadership of the CEO is based on the idea that the transformation will be fueled by a high degree of innovation and new technologies, while maximizing the value of the life cycle management of current technologies and the new organization will strengthen these capabilities across the Group.\n\nMost of the OMV Group's circular economy initiatives, especially those regarding mechanical recycling and circular products, are run by Borealis. To accelerate its transition to a circular model, Borealis has a dedicated department called Circular Economy Solutions and New Business Development. This department leads the execution of Borealis' circular economy strategy based on several thematic project focus areas, such as recycling or design for recyclability, in addition to assisting all other Borealis business areas in their industry-specific transitions. A dedicated business team is fully focused on short- to mid-term business growth opportunities in mechanical recycling, including Borealis' mtm plastics and Ecoplast businesses. The Circular Economy Innovation Studio at Borealis' Innovation Headquarters in Linz, Austria, remains Borealis' spearhead for technology and innovation, while the Digital Studio in Brussels, Belgium, is creating digital solutions for circularity. This setup enables Borealis to constantly learn and push innovation boundaries, while the business grows by offering customer-centric circular solutions that satisfy today's needs.\n\nIn 2018, Borealis launched a dedicated communication platform, EverMinds™. This platform serves to streamline all of Borealis' circular economy-related activities in order to boost their impact and promote familiarity with the topic. The platform facilitates deeper collaboration between Borealis and its partners in the interest of developing innovative and sustainable polyolefin solutions based on the circular model of design for circularity, reuse, and recycling. Further details on Borealis' specific initiatives, management, governance, and development of circular products can be found in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/digital-annual-report-2022)\n\nThe OMV Group has a variety of initiatives in place to raise awareness about recycling among its employees, specifically with regard to recycling of plastics. For instance, informative internal blogs are regularly published, and expert talks are organized with the aim of better informing employees on how to identify plastic recycling codes and the etiquette on how to correctly separate different types of plastic waste so that they will eventually be recycled.\n\nFrom June to September 2023, the newly launched Sustainability Academy provided a series of online training courses on circular economy and sustainable products. The learning path was designed to offer interested colleagues from all divisions information on and insights into the circular economy and give a more detailed overview of ongoing projects related to this material topic within the OMV Group. The training package included online learning material as well as several internal and external instructorled sessions that focused not only on introducing the concept of the circular economy, but also on providing a deeper dive into topics such as mechanical and chemical recycling. In addition, external factors like sustainability\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ncertifications and EU policies and regulations were introduced and discussed. Around 630 participants from across the OMV Group registered for the instructor-led sessions, emphasizing employees' interest in this topic.\n\n## Mechanical Recycling\n\nThe diverse properties of plastic enable a plethora of products and applications that make daily life safer, more mobile, and more eco-efficient. These properties allow us to ensure more sustainable living, while the global population grows and demand for plastic increases. However, within the linear economic model, plastic products are made, used, and then discarded. Continuing with this model will lead to more plastic waste and environmental pollution, while putting pressure on the planet's limited resources.\n\nBorealis is one of the world's leading providers of advanced and sustainable polyolefin solutions and a European front-runner in polyolefins recycling. OMV and Borealis are actively developing enhanced technologies to efficiently recycle two key plastic types, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), thereby providing an alternative to the linear \"take-make-waste\" economy. Mechanical recycling is one such technology. With mechanical recycling, the plastic is cleaned, mechanically flaked, melted down, and processed into plastic granulate. In an ideal scenario, this material can be used to make the same products again, i.e., a detergent bottle becomes a new detergent bottle. No change is made to the chemical structure of the plastic, which is why the feedstock must be sorted properly and even split into different colors.\n\nBorcycle™ M is Borealis' transformational technology for mechanical recycling, which gives polyolefin-based postconsumer waste a new lease of life. Using advanced mechanically recycled products out of the Borcycle™ M portfolio ensures a lower carbon footprint compared to using fully fossil-fuel-based products. Through Borealis and its subsidiaries (mtm plastics, Ecoplast, and a demo plant operated by a joint enterprise in Lahnstein), OMV operates three mechanical recycling plants. The demo plant in Lahnstein is a joint undertaking by Borealis, TOMRA, and Zimmerman, and was commissioned at the beginning of 2021.\n\nBorealis currently runs four mechanical recycling plants in Austria and Germany with a total capacity of around 100 kt p.a.\n\nmtm plastics GmbH, a leading German recycler of post-consumer polyolefins, was acquired in 2016. The company runs two plants and produces up to 70 kt p.a. of regranulate.\n\n- Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH in Austria was acquired in 2018. The company processes post-consumer plastic waste from households and industrial consumers into highquality recyclate destined primarily for the plastic film market. The plant has a capacity of 30 kt p.a.\n- A demo plant for advanced recycling was established in Germany in 2021 as part of a partnership with TOMRA, a Norwegian collection and sorting machine manufacturer, and Zimmermann, a German waste management company. It is one of the world's most advanced mechanical recycling plants and implements the Borcycle™ M technology.\n\nIn 2022, Borealis started looking into the development of a commercial-scale advanced mechanical recycling plant in Austria, based on the Borcycle™ M technology. The decision was supported with positive feedback from the market on the recycled polyolefins delivered by the demo plant in Lahnstein, Germany, using the same technology.\n\nThe acquisition of Rialti S.p.A. in November 2023 increases the current sustainable polyolefins production capacity by a further 50 kt. As soon as the acquisition of Integra Plastics AD, which was announced in November 2023, is completed, another 20 kt of recycling capacity will be added to Borealis' advanced mechanical recycling portfolio.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nThe Borealis recycling businesses mtm plastics and Ecoplast are certified according to the Europe-wide EuCert-Plast certification program for companies that recycle postconsumer plastic waste.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn January 2023, Borealis announced that its subsidiary Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH, a mechanical polyolefin recycler based in Wildon, Austria, had received the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS). ISCC PLUS is a global certification that covers the entire supply chain, from raw material to final product, guaranteeing compliance with the highest standards for ecological and social sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions savings, and traceability. Ecoplast is the first mechanical polyolefin recycler in Austria to achieve the certification.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- In 2023, Borealis presented a new mono-material pouch containing over 95% PP and designed for recycling, developed in collaboration with value chain partners. When processed within dedicated mechanical recycling streams for PP, this mono-material pouch yields greater volumes of high-quality recyclate fit for use in non-food, flexible PP packaging applications. It is thus the ideal format with which to fulfil the principal aims of the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR): improve recyclability, grow the market for recycled content, and reduce packaging waste. As a mono-material PP packaging format, it can help meet ambitious recycling and waste reduction targets set forth in the PPWR, as well as eco-modulation criteria for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs.\n- In June 2023, Borealis acquired Rialti S.p.A., a leading European producer of recycled polypropylene compounds. The transaction was successfully completed in November 2023. Based in Italy, Rialti is one of the European market leaders specialized in the production of sustainable polypropylene (PP) compounds with a focus on mechanically recycled PP feedstock from post-industrial and post-consumer waste. The investment will strengthen Borealis' circular portfolio, adding 50 kt of recycled compounding capacity and meeting growing customer demand for sustainable solutions.\n- In November 2023, Borealis announced the signing of an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in Integra Plastics AD, an advanced mechanical recycling player based in Bulgaria. Integra Plastics AD operates a modern advanced mechanical recycling plant built in 2019 with state-of-the-art equipment. Integra Plastics has the ability to transform post-consumer waste into high-quality polyolefin recyclates suitable for demanding applications. This investment will add more than 20 kt of recycling capacity to Borealis' advanced mechanical recycling portfolio.\n- In July 2023, Borealis' PO compounding site in Monza, Italy, received ISCC PLUS certification, as did its mechanical recycling plant mtm plastics in November. Earlier Borealis had achieved the milestone of having all of its European PO operations and PO compounding sites (with the exception of the newly acquired Rialti in Italy) certified, in addition to the Renasci recycling sites in Ostend, Belgium, and Ecoplast in Austria.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024 and over the coming years, OMV will focus on making further investments in Borealis' mechanical recycling production capacities to enable the commercial ramp-up of its circular portfolio to continuously progress toward its targets.\n\n## Chemical Recycling\n\nChemical recycling comes into play when mechanical recycling reaches its limits, for example in products where multiple types of plastics are used together. While most rigid plastic waste can be processed quite effectively through mechanical recycling, flexible materials (e.g., plastic film) are still predominantly incinerated or sent to landfill. Chemical recycling is the only way of overcoming this challenge. It involves altering the chemical composition of the plastic to produce pyrolysis oil from plastic waste. This synthetic oil can then be used to make any type of plastic or product. Because the quality of these products is effectively comparable to virgin plastics, they can also be used in tightly regulated areas such as the food and medical industries. Plastic waste thereby becomes a valuable raw material.\n\nOMV has been exploring the potential for utilizing post-consumer plastics, i.e., polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, through chemical recycling since 2011. The Austrian Research Promotion Agency has also contributed to this effort with subsidies covering part of the project investment. The first test facility was launched in 2013. In 2018, the nextlevel test facility – the ReOil® 100 pilot plant – began fully refinery-integrated operation with a processing capacity of up to 100 kg/h and a production capacity of up to 100 l/h of pyrolysis oil.\n\nIn 2021, the final investment decision (FID) was made to build a prototype of a ReOil® demonstration plant at an intermediary refinery scale with a design capacity of 16 kta. This plant, called ReOil® 2000, will be fully operational in 2024. To finance this project, OMV entered its first-ever green loan agreement. This is aligned with the green loan principles and is based on a green and project-specific external due diligence appraisal, called a second party opinion, and a projectspecific green financing framework. The plant will be fully integrated within the petrochemical production units at the Schwechat refinery in Austria, enabling OMV to guarantee the best use of resources, maximum efficiency, and the highest industrial safety standards, while creating around 50 new jobs. It represents a crucial step in developing ReOil® into an industrial-scale chemical recycling technology with a processing capacity of up to 200 kta.\n\nThe pyrolysis oil produced in the ReOil® plant is further processed into monomers in the refinery's steam cracker to produce high-quality base chemicals for the plastics industry. At Borealis, these monomers are then converted into high-grade polymers. Borcycle™ C represents the portfolio of chemically recycled polyolefins that Borealis is offering to the market. These products are suitable for very demanding applications such as food contact materials. Borcycle™ C is not only the label for the portfolio of chemically recycled products offered to its customers, but also the designated name for Borealis' own technology solutions for chemical recycling.

The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house.\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nBorcycle™ M, in which \"M\" stands for mechanical recycling, it forms the Borcycle™ portfolio of all-round polyolefin solutions for plastics circularity based on the Borcycle™ technology suite launched in 2019.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Selection of Feedstock**\n\nThe ReOil® facility can process different forms of plastic waste, ranging from household waste to waste from commercial and industrial sources. The main feedstocks are polyethylene (e.g., films), polypropylene (e.g., food packaging and car parts), and polystyrene (e.g., packaging and insulation materials). Currently, the recycled feedstock is sourced almost exclusively from Austrian waste sorting facilities. With regard to the ambition of developing an industrial-scale ReOil® plant and the resulting need for more feedstock, the geographical scope for feedstock sourcing will be expanded and countries neighboring Austria will be explored.\n\n#### **Technology**\n\nPlastic is an excellent heat isolator with poor heat transfer properties, compared with glass or metal. These properties, which make plastic desirable in everyday life, also make it difficult to break down. OMV's proprietary ReOil® technology is based on pyrolysis, a well-known refinery process during which thermoplastics are first melted and then cracked at a temperature of about 400–450°C. This means that long-chain hydrocarbons are cracked into shorter-chain light hydrocarbons. One of the inherent challenges in pyrolysis stems from the fact that, compared with glass or metal, plastics are notoriously difficult to melt, and once melted, are highly viscous, which impairs the heat transfer necessary for pyrolysis. The ReOil® technology is unique compared to that of competitors because of the use of an innovative heat transfer technology, which allows the viscosity of the molten plastic to be reduced and thus heat transfer to be improved. As a result, the ReOil® process is scalable to industrial scale (up to 200 kta). Thanks to the integration into OMV's refinery in Schwechat, Austria, ReOil® also achieves higher yields than other non-integrated chemical recycling technologies.\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nThe ReOil® pilot plant and the ReOil® 2000 demo plant are both certified according to the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). ISCC PLUS is a sustainability certification that is well-recognized by all stakeholders in recycled and biobased materials, providing traceability along the supply chain and verifying that companies meet environmental and social standards. Compliance with the certification means that for each ton of circular feedstock fed into the ReOil® plant and replacing fossil fuels, a certain proportion of the output can be classified as circular by using the mass balance approach.\n\n#### **Emissions Reduction**\n\nIn 2021, OMV commissioned a life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the CO2 reduction potential of its ReOil<sup>®</sup> chemical recycling technology versus incineration. The LCA was conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology (ICT) according to ISO standards 14040 and 14044, and independently peer-reviewed by three world-leading institutes. The LCA analyzes the different treatments of one ton of pre-sorted mixed plastic waste on waste-to-gate level, starting with the collection of waste and ending with the production of polymers and energy. The LCA compares two systems ensuring the same outputs: (i) a linear economy, where waste goes to incineration producing thermal energy and electricity, and where polymers are produced from fossil sources, vs. (ii) a circular economy, where these waste streams are chemically recycled, and the same amount of thermal energy and electricity is produced based on the expected future energy mix in Austria. The LCA shows significant benefits of the circular economy system: 34% of CO2e emissions could be saved by 2030 if waste streams that are currently going to incineration are chemically recycled using the ReOil® technology.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\nIn October 2023, OMV announced the final investment decision to build an innovative sorting plant developed by Interzero, Europe's leading provider of circular economy solutions, to produce feedstock for chemical recycling. For that purpose, OMV and Interzero established a joint venture, in which OMV holds 89.9% of the shares and 10.1% of the shares belong to Interzero. OMV will invest over EUR 170 mn in building this state-of-the-art facility in Walldürn, southern Germany, which will also lead to the creation of around 120 new jobs on site. With a processing capacity of up to 260,000 t of post-consumer mixed waste plastic per year, this fully automatic sorting facility will be the first of its kind to produce feedstock for OMV's chemical recycling on a large industrial scale. The innovative sorting process used in the new facility will make it possible to recover a polyolefin-rich fraction from a waste stream that currently ends up in thermal recycling due to its unsuitability for mechanical recycling. This process has already been tested on an industrial scale and the product has been successfully processed as feedstock in OMV's ReOil® pilot plant. Construction began in Q4 2023 and production is expected to start in 2026. The strategic partnership between OMV and Interzero combines the complementary strengths and capabilities of both parties, with the joint aim of taking another step toward a world without waste.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/1 description: The image contains three icons. The first icon is a print icon inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle. The icons are all blue.\n\n- In October 2023, OMV and Wood, a global leader in consulting and engineering solutions in energy and materials markets, signed a mutually exclusive collaboration agreement for the commercial licensing of OMV's proprietary ReOil® technology, following a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed between the two parties in November 2022. The companies will bring the ReOil® technology to the global market together utilizing Wood's proprietary heater technology and will establish a joint technology and engineering delivery team to support clients throughout the whole process of adopting and successfully implementing the technology at their sites. In addition, Wood will work with ReOil® licensees to provide full asset life cycle support globally.\n- In early 2023, Borealis announced the capability to use its proprietary Borcycle™ C chemical recycling process to recycle cross-linked polyethylene (PE) types such as XLPE and PE-X into recycled polyethylene. Thanks to its suitability for high-performance applications, the recycled PE obtained from the pyrolysis process can replace virgin PE in the manufacture of XLPE and PE-X for use in the wire and cable and infrastructure industries respectively. Using ISCC PLUS certified grades in the Borcycle™ C portfolio enables customers to capitalize on circular solutions while at the same time maintaining high application quality and meeting industry standards.\n- Borealis entered into a partnership with Renasci in 2021 to work on the innovative Smart Chain Processing concept, including a plastic to pyrolysis oils process. In 2022, Borealis acquired a minority share in Renasci, which it increased to a majority shareholding of 50.01% in early 2023. The participation in Renasci was further increased in Q4 2023 to approximately 98%. The investment gives Borealis greater access to chemically recycled feedstock, thereby strengthening the Borcycle™ C portfolio.\n- In February 2023, Neste, Borealis, Uponor, and Wastewise successfully produced pipes made of crosslinked polyethylene (PE-X), which was based on feedstock gained from chemically recycled post-industrial waste plastic from PE-X pipe production using the ISCC PLUS-certified mass balance approach. PE-X pipes are an important contributor to energy-efficient heating and safe plumbing due to their robustness, temperature resistance, and longevity, yet the interconnected polymer chains make them nearly impossible to recycle using conventional recycling technologies. The project shows that chemical recycling can close the circularity loop for hard-to-recycle waste plastic, turning it into high-quality polymer feedstock and enabling the consecutive manufacturing of products with quality and properties identical to those in their previous life.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nSince the first ReOil® trials in OMV's own laboratory, there has been a lot of ongoing development. The ReOil® 2000 plant will become operational in 2024 at OMV's refinery site in Schwechat, Austria, with a capacity of 16 kta. The next step is the development of an industrial-scale ReOil® plant with a planned capacity of 200 kta. Furthermore, the first ReOil® licenses are due to be launched to the market over the course of 2024, marking an important milestone in promoting circularity and chemical recycling in the industry.\n\n### Renewable Feedstock\n\nTogether with partners, OMV is actively pursuing the development of industry-scale projects to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and bioplastics from renewable feedstock, including waste streams. Waste biomass, such as residual agricultural, forestry, and wood processing matter, or mixed municipal waste are not in competition with the food and feed chain. While the conversion of such waste biomass into high-value products is often technically challenging, the resulting benefits are a significant reduction in CO2 compared with fossil fuels and local resource utilization that creates value. The biobased feedstock, which is used at OMV's subsidiary Borealis in order to produce sustainable polyolefins, is currently entirely derived from waste biomass such as residual agricultural processing matter or collected waste streams and is not in competition with the food and feed chain. These polyolefins are marketed to the end customer under the portfolio name Bornewables™. In this section, the focus is on plastics based on renewable feedstock. For more information on energy products based on renewable feedstock, please refer to Energy Transition.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nAs a global standard for recycled and biobased materials, ISCC PLUS enables traceability along the supply chain by verifying that companies comply with certain environmental and social standards and by establishing a chain of custody. Applying the mass balance approach enables OMV to provide a verifiable basis for tracking the amount of its renewable and chemically recycled raw materials in the value chain. Providing more products that are certified by ISCC PLUS is crucial for the transition to a more circular economy. OMV's cracker in Burghausen was one of the first 20 worldwide to be ISCC PLUS certified for the production of renewable benzene, butadiene, and isobutylene. Additionally, the production of ethylene and propylene at OMV's Burghausen and Schwechat refineries is also ISCC PLUS certified.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/1 description: The image shows three circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left arrow. The third icon contains a right arrow.\n\nThe Bornewables™ portfolio, Borcycle™ C, and Borvida™ are certified according to ISCC PLUS, by applying the mass balance approach. This means that the materials are not physically segregated in the production processes throughout the entire supply chain, but they are separated in bookkeeping to provide a verifiable basis for tracking the amount and sustainability characteristics of circular and/or biobased content in the value chain. This certification system ensures the traceability of the renewable, sustainably produced feedstock from its point of origin through the entire chain of custody. The Bornewables™ polypropylene, for example, is a second-generation renewable feedstock, derived entirely from waste and residue vegetable oil streams. The milestone of having all of Borealis' European polyolefin and polyolefin compounding sites, the Renasci recycling sites in Oostende, Belgium, and Ecoplast in Austria ISCC PLUS certified was reached in mid-2023, when the PO compounding site in Monza, Italy, received the respective certification.\n\n#### **Life Cycle Assessment**\n\nIn the life cycle assessment published in 2021, Borealis demonstrated that Bornewables™ is especially suited to reducing carbon emissions. The assessment showed that the greenhouse gas emissions of Bornewables™ polypropylene and polyethylene go beyond carbon neutrality and can be reduced by at least 120% from cradle to gate (meaning all the steps from the sourcing of raw materials to products leaving Borealis' production site) compared to fossil-fuel-based polypropylene and polyethylene. According to the LCA's findings, using Bornewables™ substantially reduces a product's carbon footprint by at least 1.9 kg CO2e for every kilogram of polymer. This is possible while offering the same high performance levels as virgin polyolefins and the ability to be recycled in the same way.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nOMV is currently working on comprehensive life cycle assessments (LCAs) for its fossil-based and renewable petrochemical products being produced at the refineries in Burghausen, Germany, and Schwechat, Austria. These LCAs are being conducted in accordance with the applicable ISO standards 14040 and 14044 and will undergo a critical peer review process. Once completed, the results are expected to be published in 2024.\n\nOver the course of 2023, OMV's subsidiary Borealis continued to commercialize the Bornewables™ portfolio. Some significant developments include:\n\n- In April 2023, it was announced that PFNonwovens Group (PFN) had teamed up with Borealis to enhance their production of nonwoven materials for the personal hygiene market and set a new industry standard by using Bornewables™ polypropylene (PP) resins for spunbond and meltblown solutions. Using the certified renewable Bornewables™ polymers in the manufacturing of absorbent hygiene products, from baby diapers to feminine hygiene products, supports the PFNonwovens Group in meeting the growing market demand for more sustainable nonwoven solutions.\n- In May 2023, Borealis introduced the Bornewables™ line Queo™, a range of high-performance polyolefin plastomers and elastomers based on renewable feedstock. Borealis' production location Geleen, the Netherlands, is the production site for Queo™. The facility received the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS) in March 2023, thus enabling Borealis to introduce this new product line. Queo™ represents an expansion of the Bornewables™ portfolio of circular polyolefin products, which offer the same material performance as fossil-based polyolefins yet decoupled from fossil-based feedstock and with reduced carbon emissions. Applications include automotive, flexible and rigid packaging, housewares, and wire and cables.\n- In July 2023, Borealis' polyolefin (PO) compounding site in Monza, Italy, received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS). With the certification of the Monza site, Borealis is now able to offer circular PO products manufactured with renewable feedstocks (Bornewables™) and grades based on chemically recycled feedstock (Borcycle™ C) as part of their Monza PO compounds portfolio.\n- Borealis began exploring carbon capture technologies and the use of carbon dioxide as a resource as an alternative to fossil-based resources. Following the proofs of concept, their target is to scale up these initiatives in 2024.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nBy 2030, OMV plans to establish a production capacity of approximately 2,000 kta of sustainable polymers and other chemicals, including biobased polyolefins. To achieve this, OMV will build up capacity for the procurement of sustainable feedstock and develop and implement a sustainable product portfolio for biobased polyolefins.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

We continuously aim to improve our employees' health and ability to work through integrated health management. We build on sustainable safety measures to protect people by providing a safe and healthy workplace and ensuring the safety and reliability of our plants. We also protect people and assets from the possibility of intentional malicious threats.\n\nOMV's long-term business success is dependent on our ability to continually improve the quality of our business activities while protecting people, the environment, assets, and our reputation. The Health, Safety, and Security strategic focus area emphasizes reducing health and safety risks for OMV employees and customers, as well as protecting assets, information, and operations against any threat. Particularly in times of geopolitical unrest, our Company's resilience is dependent on our emergency and crisis management capabilities.\n\n## Health, Safety, and Well-Being\n\n#### **Material Topic: Health, Safety, and Well-Being**\n\nReducing health and safety risks for OMV employees, customers, and third parties, such as communities, and promoting physical and mental health in an integrative way\n\n#### **Key GRIs NaDiVeG**\n\n- GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018\n- GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety 2016\n\n#### **Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/13 description: The image contains two icons related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nEnsuring the health, safety, and security of our employees, contractors, and assets is essential for OMV. Employee health and well-being are the foundation for successful company performance, as they are core elements of ensuring the ability to work. OMV aims to adhere to the highest standards to provide its employees and contractors with a safe workplace.\n\nOMV's HSSE vision is \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\" This vision is embedded in the [HSSE Policy,](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522138560653/dload_HSSE%20Policy_EN) which is OMV's public commitment to health, safety, security, and the environment. Our chemicals subsidiary, Borealis, is committed to implementing the guidelines of the Responsible Care Global Charter, which is the chemical industry's voluntary initiative aimed at continuous improvement in health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nThe OMV Group HSSE strategy sets out the mid-term strategic goals and targets to support the Group's business strategy. The HSSE Strategy 2025 is based on a framework that was developed in 2012 and has since been regularly updated. As the OMV Group comprehensively updated its transformational business strategy (OMV Strategy 2030) in 2022 and bearing in mind the substantial changes ongoing in the regulatory environment, a major review of the HSSE strategy was conducted during 2023, resulting in an updated HSSE Strategy 2030. While proven HSSE management concepts will be continued and further developed, it was identified that HSSE culture, contractor management, and parts of safety and environmental management need a stronger and updated strategic focus over the coming years.\n\nThe strategy revision process included a large number of stakeholders. Changes in the business, specifically the new low-carbon and recycling businesses, were discussed during 13 meetings with the responsible managers of the various areas. A SWOT analysis was conducted over several weeks with numerous subject matter experts and the involvement of over 50 senior managers at two dedicated workshops. The massive emerging changes driven by international regulations, such as sustainability reporting and environmental management, were evaluated to find strategic responses to how to handle them in future. And finally, the proposed updates to the strategy were discussed with all Executive Board members of OMV, OMV\n\nPetrom, and Borealis in a unique half-day on-site workshop. Executive management challenged the proposed strategic targets and provided steering and backing for their implementation.\n\nThe updated HSSE Strategy 2030 is strongly linked to the company Values and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **We care** about safety and the physical and mental well-being of our people; for the planet we live on; for the people we interact with; for our locations and assets.\n- **We're curious** about our future partners, contractors, and technologies so we can develop the business relationship together to achieve the highest HSSE standards.\n- **We progress** to enable the successful transformation of our company toward sustainability and to become the industry leader in HSSE.\n\nWhile we are able to build on a solid foundation for the further strategic development of the various HSSE disciplines and their integration in the business, we have identified key areas that will receive a much higher focus in terms of how we manage HSSE in the business in future.\n\n- The aim is to develop a company culture where HSSE shapes decision-making at any time and at every level, based on highly committed leaders, a competent workforce of employees and contractor employees, and an atmosphere of openness where everybody has the confidence to speak up.\n- Given the high degree of contractor work in our business, we will further strengthen our supplier and contractor management capabilities. We aim to improve the selection process to ensure that only contractors with appropriate HSSE capabilities work with us. When needed, we will put effort (e.g., training, supervision) into helping contractors reach the expected HSSE performance levels. We will focus on long-term relationships with our key contractors based on mutual trust and develop their HSSE culture jointly.\n- We will leverage the opportunities afforded by new technologies to improve our systems and tools to manage HSSE, including product stewardship.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons.

The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Overview of the Updates to the HSSE Strategy 2030**\n\nHSSE Strategy 2030\n\nStrategic Goals\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/4 description: The image is a graphic that represents a company's commitment to safety and sustainability. The graphic is shaped like an infinity symbol, with different sections representing different aspects of the company's commitment. The center of the graphic contains the text \"INDUSTRY LEADER 2030\". The left side of the graphic contains the text \"Committed to Zero Harm\", \"Protect People, Environment, and Assets\", \"Culture\", \"Supplier & Contractor Management\", and \"Processes. Regulations. Tools.\". The right side of the graphic contains the text \"Occupational Safety\", \"Health\", \"Product Stewardship\", \"Environment\", \"Process Safety\", and \"Security & Resilience\". There is a picture of workers in the center of the right side of the graphic.\n\nRollout and implementation of the updated HSSE strategy began in Q4/23. The data reported in the OMV Sustainability Report 2023 is therefore still based on the 2025 HSSE strategy.\n\nHSSE management is governed by the internal HSSE Directive, which defines key expectations in compliance with internal HSSE regulations at various levels of the organizational structure, as well as across Group and local functions. This internal Directive sets out the principles and rules for the management of HSSE-related risks and activities throughout the life cycle of the Group's business and activities, including capital projects, mergers, and acquisitions. The Directive also defines key HSSE responsibilities for all OMV Group employees, partners, and contractors. It additionally stipulates the continuous improvement of HSSE performance. The HSSE Directive defines core aspects of HSSE management, grouped into twelve elements revolving around the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. For each element, the HSSE Directive defines the approach to follow for effective HSSE management.\n\nOther corporate regulations governing the topic are HSSE Risk Management, Process Safety Management, Occupational Safety Management, Contractor HSSE Management, Management of Hazardous Substances, and Personnel Transportation, as well as Reporting, Investigation, and\n\nClassification of Incidents, which together provide the framework for safety management. Our Major Accident Prevention Policy sets out the overall aims and guidelines for controlling the risk of a major accident as part of the OMV Group's operations. Acknowledging that the risk of major accidents in onshore or offshore operations related to oil and gas extraction, transportation, refining, and distribution activities is significant, and recognizing that such major accidents can have severe consequences for the environment and affected persons, OMV firmly believes that a strong awareness of HSSE embedded in the company culture is the foundation for all its operations and relationships with contractors. Our Contractor HSSE Management Standard defines the minimum requirements for integrating HSSE issues into all phases of the contract life cycle and into the contractor management process. This standard aims to define a structured process for the HSSE management of contractors, from selection through contract close-out. All 15 Group HSSE regulations have been implemented at Borealis, following an intensive alignment process conducted in 2021.\n\nThe HSSE strategy is implemented by means of annual plans and targets. In a combined top-down and bottom-up process, 43 local annual HSSE plans are developed and monitored centrally.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The stages are arranged in a clockwise direction, with arrows indicating the flow of the process. The diagram also includes the terms \"Plan\", \"Do\", \"Check\", and \"Act\", which are associated with the corresponding stages. The diagram also includes the phrase \"Continuous Improvements\" at the top. The diagram also includes numbered text boxes around the outside of the circle. The text boxes are numbered 1 through 12, and they contain the following text: 1 Leadership and Commitment, 2 Organization, 3 People, Competency, and Behavior, 4 Risk Management, 5 Engineering and Project Management, 6 Operations and Performance Management, 7 Contracted Services, 8 Planning and Cost Management, 9 Incidents and Accidents, 10 Emergency and Crisis Control, 11 Stakeholder Dialogue and Information Management, and 12 Audit and Review.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe health and safety of the people who work for us are key priorities at OMV. The HSSE strategy and its implementation are aligned with and fully embedded in the corporate strategy and the corporate governance structure. Leadership responsibility is assigned to the members of the Executive Board. The Executive Board's remuneration is subject to a Health & Safety Malus (read more in Sustainability Governance). In 2022, focus areas related to safety were defined, with an Executive Board member assigned as the owner of each. For instance, one OMV Executive Board Member serves as the focus topic owner for process safety performance in the OMV Group. In regular update meetings, the owners discuss updates on process safety challenges and achievements.\n\nGroup HSSE is responsible for coordinating health and safety topics across the Group. Group HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The OMV Group HSSE department is organized into specialized teams with experienced experts in the following areas:\n\nDevelopment and implementation of OMV's HSSE VP HSSE at Group level. strategy, regulations, and processes\n\n- HSSE risk assessment\n- Incident investigation\n- HSSE data analysis and reporting\n- Health management\n- Occupational safety management\n- Process safety management\n- Security and resilience management\n- Environmental management\n\nThis is supplemented by local HSSE officers at each site, along with local subject matter experts. For example, at each refinery, we have a dedicated employee who heads the process safety management. This individual is in direct contact with and actively collaborates and communicates with all departments that manage process safety as part of their daily business. This individual also receives process safety guidance from a centralized Process Safety Advisor overseeing the whole of the Refining business unit. In addition, there are HSSE departments at OMV Petrom and Borealis that oversee their specific issues and coordinate their local HSSE officers and experts. The OMV Petrom and Borealis HSSE departments report functionally to the\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nIn line with the HSSE Directive, clear roles and responsibilities are defined for all staff, line management, and senior management. Line management is responsible for ensuring that HSSE issues are integrated into all business decisions and activities. They are required to demonstrate commitment and leadership by acting as role models and taking appropriate measures to control and manage all HSSE risks in their spheres of responsibility. OMV's HSSE management includes interaction with employees or their representatives (works councils, trade unions) as a channel of engagement regarding issues that are particularly important and necessary for improvement. For instance, Borealis has HSE Forums at each location, where employee representatives are consulted and informed about the HSE management system. The HSSE department organizes HSSE Days for OMV's various units to inform employees about HSSE topics.\n\n## Health\n\nThe physical and mental health and well-being of our employees are the foundations for a successful company. Health management at OMV follows both a strategic and an operational system. Its success depends on leadership, commitment, and participation at all levels and functions in the organization, from medical specialists and partners to employees.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nWe have established an OMV health care standard to ensure a high level of care for employee health across the Company. OMV's internal Group Health Standard describes the main principles, roles and responsibilities, and lines of communication within the OMV Group. The standard provides a framework for managing preventive health measures and curative health care, as well as collaboration among HSSE specialists. It supplements local legal requirements, allowing us to establish a harmonized level of health care services and access to medical facilities at all OMV sites.\n\nThe Group Health Standard governs the work of operative medical service providers in relation to the following areas:\n\n- Planning of human resources, medical facilities and services, and local health plans\n- Operational health risk assessment and management, emergency preparedness, preventive initiatives such as targeted health promotion campaigns, health programs and training sessions, and curative care\n- Minimum equipment and materials for our clinics both on land and offshore – such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), defibrillators, suction units, rescue devices, and emergency medication\n- Checks and audits of medical suppliers (laboratories, partner clinics, pharmacies), hygiene in food facilities, customer satisfaction\n- Reporting\n- Collaboration with contractors and subcontractors on health and safety\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nOMV applies its own risk management standard, which provides for a thorough assessment of possible risks, including health-related risks. We have therefore developed guidelines – based on international guidelines from IOGP/Ipieca – for health risk assessments covering such risks as harm from chemical agents, psychological strain, physical injuries, and others.\n\n#### **Preventive Care**\n\nOMV maintains or works with a total of 45 medical units across all locations where we have operating facilities. To mitigate occupational health risks, our medical staff carries out specific preventive examinations in accordance with the legal regulations of the countries in which we operate. These examinations include blood tests for employees working with specific hazardous substances and hearing tests for employees exposed to noise. We offer general health screenings to our workforce. In 2023, a voluntary screening and check-up service for cardiovascular issues was offered to all OMV Group colleagues based at the head office in Vienna, and similar check-ups were offered at many other clinics for employees in other workplaces and countries. In addition, we run seasonal campaigns to provide free vaccinations against flu and tick-borne encephalitis in affected areas. In 2023, COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters were offered once again.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nA special health audit program developed by the Corporate Health Management department serves as an evaluation tool to ensure that our common corporate health care standard is implemented and followed throughout the Group. The program stipulates that all clinics and medical partners be audited every three years, and clinics also report on a self-conducted audit every year. In 2023, after most of the COVID-19 related travel restrictions were lifted, Corporate Health Management was once again able to perform health audits in Romania, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Serbia, and Bulgaria; all other clinics carried out selfaudits. Audit results serve as the basis for identifying areas for further improvement and analyzing the effectiveness of our health management approach.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### **Community Engagement**\n\nThe presence of OMV's first aid facilities benefits the local population, as it often provides necessary medical help in remote areas where medical services might not be easily or quickly accessible (e.g., in Yemen). In 2023, OMV's first aid facilities supported 1,737 individuals in the local population in need of urgent care. From this perspective, our assistance to the local population ensures a positive impact outside OMV's operational boundaries, thereby contributing to building a good relationship with our neighbors. Read more about our engagement on SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being, in the Community Investments section.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn 2023, COVID-19 prevention was still on the agenda of medical staff in some countries (e.g., Romania, Germany, and Austria), where it was legally possible for vaccinations to be administered at workplaces.\n\n- **15** clinics audited by OMV Corporate Health<sup>20</sup>\n- **51,729** voluntary health screenings<sup>20</sup>\n- **5,352** vaccinations<sup>20</sup>\n- **102,518** medical consultations<sup>20</sup>\n- **17,582** occupational health examinations<sup>20</sup>\n- **21,887** physiotherapy treatments<sup>20</sup>\n- **1,864** psychological consultations<sup>20</sup>\n\nIn fall 2023, doctors and other health care professionals came together and discussed the main challenges, such as mental health issues and the latest developments in emergency medicine. The focus topics for preventive care for 2023 were discussed and a plan for implementation developed.\n\nEvery year, we organize health promotion activities to enhance the knowledge of our employees on healthrelated issues.\n\n- At the Health Circle in Gänserndorf, Austria, employees gather regularly to address work-related health issues and create customized solutions in collaboration with the local health team.\n- The Corporate Health and Learning departments have developed a new collaborative initiative to raise awareness of health issues over the last few years. In 2023, webinars were held focusing on issues such as ideas for achieving a better work-life balance, while another was organized to discuss the promotion of mental health.\n\nLocally in some countries, face-to-face health promotion sessions were able to take place, with the main topics including a breast cancer awareness campaign that continued in Romania and offers free and voluntary breast ultrasounds, followed by the availability of a specialist doctor examination in case of abnormalities.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn collaboration with a task force from the health committee of IOGP/Ipieca, we will elaborate a guideline and training materials for the relationship between mental health and leadership. Emphasis will be placed on raising awareness of this relationship and how to improve it. The first pilot training session are scheduled to for the second half of 2024 so that training can be organized at all our workplaces starting in 2025.\n\n#### Occupational Safety\n\nOMV aims to adhere to the highest standards to provide its employees and contractors with a safe workplace. This is not only a moral obligation but also necessary for seamless operations, without costly shutdowns or delays due to incidents.\n\nThe OMV Group's Reporting, Investigation, and Classification of Incidents Standard clearly outlines the systematic approach to be followed (beyond local/national laws) and the regulations and roles, responsibilities when notifying, reporting, investigating, and classifying incidents within the OMV Group, together with identifying appropriate preventive and corrective actions. OMV Group's HSSE Directive covers all HSSE terms and definitions, including work-related injuries for all OMV Group employees and contractors.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Procedures**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments and Audits**\n\nMajor risks and the respective mitigation measures are evaluated and monitored within the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process, and documented in a Group-wide database (Active Risk Management System; ARMS). They are reported to top management twice a year or as necessary whenever issues arise. Senior management are directly involved in the review of risks identified as a top priority. Sites are audited regularly based on a Group-wide HSSE audit program. For example, in 2023 we had an HSSE Management System Audit at the Burghausen refinery. The audit showed good implementation and application of the 12 HSSE management elements. Recommendations from the audit contributes to continuous improvement.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### **Incident Reporting and Investigation**\n\nAll employees and contractors are encouraged to bring any unsafe conditions and behaviors to the attention of line management in order for them to identify and resolve potential issues that might otherwise lead to future incidents or accidents. We acknowledge these suggestions for improvement submitted by employees and contractors locally.\n\nAll incidents, hazards, HSSE walks, audits, findings, and defined actions are reported and tracked within a central HSSE reporting tool (OMV Synergi). Online training is regularly organized via the My Success Factors learning platform to ensure the effective use of the tool, e.g., by highlighting the importance of the quality of data input.\n\nDashboards for the most significant HSSE data and relevant KPIs (e.g., LTIs, TRIs, HiPos, process safety events, and action status) have been set up and made available to various management levels Group-wide. Since 2016, all Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events have been transferred to our centralized reporting tool to enable trend analysis and sharing of findings from past events. Our aim here was to increase awareness of OMV Synergi entries to boost their quality and transparency, and to improve data owner accountability.\n\nWe continue to investigate incidents and accidents using the knowledge of our incident investigator pool members and other technical experts. In 2023, we again trained more than 104 colleagues during a one-day incident investigation training session. In addition to the training, a Community of Practice Meeting was organized for incident investigators. This event is used for communicating experiences and findings from incident investigations across the Group.\n\nOur aim regarding incident investigation is to find the root causes of incidents and to carry out suitable and necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of more severe incidents in the future. Here, the focus is not only on incidents that have occurred but also on near misses that, under slightly different circumstances, could have the potential to lead to serious accidents. In parallel, the focus remains on verifying the effectiveness of actions implemented in previous years after severe and high-potential incidents (HiPos), including process safety incidents. In this way, OMV Synergi is updated with information about safety events that have happened over the last few years to help foster learning from past incidents. The incident investigation process has been further developed, and a subprocess to share HSSE information and promote our lessons learned as an organization has also been established. Our Incident Investigation Panel meets quarterly to obtain a\n\nclear overview of the whole process and to implement practical measures for its improvement.\n\n#### **Training, Awareness Raising, and Safety Promotion Activities**\n\nAll staff are required to be familiar with the HSSE Policy, internal HSSE regulations, and relevant legislation. They actively contribute to and further develop HSSE awareness as part of our corporate culture, for example by stopping and reporting unsafe or irresponsible acts and conditions and reporting any incidents and non-compliance. OMV employees at all levels are regularly trained in their roles and responsibilities.\n\nEducation and training are important for informing workers and managers about workplace hazards and controls so they can work more safely and be more productive. After the update and Group-wide alignment of our Life-Saving Rules (LSR), we ran an intensive program of face-to-face rollout workshops led by line management to reach all employees and contractor employees. Furthermore, the LSR are presented and discussed regularly during awareness programs, workshops, management walk-arounds, and safety walks, as well as during various meetings. Practical LSR training will be continued and delivered systematically in the Safety Centers, for which the training concept and material have been fully reviewed and updated. Based on this, existing Safety Centers will be redeveloped, and new ones created in 2024.\n\nWe believe that promoting an open dialogue and establishing a culture in which health and safety are integrated into every employee's role are effective ways to empower people to work safely. Workers are engaged in initiating, implementing, evaluating, and improving health and safety programs. They work closely with their managers to find joint solutions to common problems, which helps managers pinpoint issues while motivating and encouraging workers to improve their own safety. To concentrate on quality over quantity in terms of reporting, HSSE walks, safety walks, and action close-outs continued throughout 2023. In addition, efforts to make safety a top priority in the minds of employees were continued. More attention is focused on improving the HSSE walks and safety walks by encouraging open dialogue while they're in progress. This promotes understanding of the challenges in the operating fields and increases trust between the workforce and management.\n\n#### **Focus on Contractor Safety**\n\nThe safety of our contractors is just as important as the safety of our own employees. For this reason, we have established processes that require contractors to work according to our standards. Our Contractor HSSE Management Process begins when we issue the scope of work\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle with an arrow going around it.\n\nwith information about HSSE requirements and the HSSE key performance indicators (KPIs). The process continues through the tender stage with the HSSE evaluation and capability audit, if needed. Once the contract terms are agreed and the contract is awarded, and before work begins at the site, we reinforce our expectations and requirements during kick-off meetings, HSSE induction, site specific training, and other joint meetings.\n\nThe presence of contractors at our sites is monitored around the clock using an electronic registration system (e.g., in the refineries) or paper sign-in system (e.g., attendance sheet, permit to work, and induction sheet). During the contract period, we monitor our contractors by way of audits, inspections, joint HSSE or safety walks, service quality meetings, forums, and workshops, using the outcomes to share information and encourage improvement of our HSSE performance as a team. To increase the awareness and knowledge of contract owners, contract holders (i.e., the beneficiaries in need of external services), procurement staff, and HSSE experts regarding our Contractor HSSE Management Process, we have continued to deliver specific training explaining how HSSE requirements and tools are embedded in the source-to-contract process. Having trained over 800 people on Contractor HSSE Management between 2019 and 2022, the training program continued with e-learning and webinars, as well as individual coaching and counseling for selected sourcing projects. Contract owners, contract holders, and procurement staff were the main target group of these training sessions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**37%** of our sites are certified to ISO 45001 (covering **29%** of OMV employees).\n\n**91** formal joint health and safety committees comprising management and worker representatives were organized at OMV Group sites.\n\n**44,001** unsafe conditions and behavior reports were received in our reporting tool.\n\nIn 2023, the number of injured personnel increased among both our own employees and those of contractors. This trend is not only evident within OMV, but also across the whole industry, according to the IOGP position statement \"2022 safety trends and responses\" dated February 2023. The main reasons for the deterioration of the key safety indicators of our industry include:\n\nlingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n- a clear increase in industry activity, with associated aggressive hiring and reduction in collective experience levels\n- geopolitical situation, both in terms of direct stress on both individuals and their organizations, and the workload increase due to energy security imperatives.\n\nTo take countermeasures and to improve safety and bring it back to the highest level, various activities and programs have been carried out:\n\n- In our operations, motivational management and practical training is a key topic to encourage positive behavior. For example, during the 2023 turnaround at the Schwechat refinery and polyolefin production facility, where more than 6,000 contractor employees were on duty every day, special safety behavior was praised and encouraged with a selection of small goodies. More than a thousand foremen were also given practical training in the specially built safety training centers in order to act as a multiplier for safety on site. This helped improve the relationship between the workforce and management and also encouraged safe behavior, leading to an overall positive impact at our sites.\n- A big focus here is on Contractor Safety Improvement. Safety programs with the aim of consolidating and improving safety performance were implemented with a wide variety of contractors. In order to underline their importance, they are supported and managed by senior management as a sponsor.\n- In line with our \"Committed to Zero Harm\" vision, Borealis developed and implemented stringent measures to improve our safety performance. These include the new B-Safe program, which involves employees and supervisors of main contractors participating in either a three-day training course (all leaders including top management) or a one-day training course (all other employees). The program focuses on proactive intervention to prevent safety incidents, risk identification measures, learning from past incidents, and promoting a heightened awareness of the importance of looking out for others while working.\n- In order to create a better common understanding of what motivates the employees in their daily safety work and, on the other hand, what expectations management has with regard to safety work, the \"Day with the crew\" initiative was launched at OMV Petrom.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer symbol. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- In order to draw further attention to the topic of health and safety, on May 2 and 3, 2023, we held a Groupwide session to celebrate the UN World Day for Safety and Health at Work. Around 850 colleagues participated in the two action-packed days at the head office in Vienna. During the event, we informed the participants about the know-how required to optimize workspaces when working from home and how to get your bike fit for the new season. In addition, \"Driving\" was chosen from the OMV Life-Saving Rules as a focus topic. Additional safety days were held at the various locations, where theory and practice were combined. This was an additional great opportunity for both our own and contractor employees to discuss health and safety in a practical way.\n- The incident investigation panel meets quarterly and consists of the divisional HSSE Managers, the Incident Investigation & Analysis Advisor, the VP HSSE, and the Head of Coordination & Implementation HSSE. They ensure:\n\t- the quality of incident investigation reports\n\t- the effectiveness of the defined actions\n\n**Lost-Time Injury Rate**\n\n- event frequency and trend analysis is reviewed\n- focus areas for lessons learned are defined and communicated\n- To improve the incident investigation process and ensure that the new incident investigators get the right support, we started 2023 with an Incident Investigators Community of Practice Experience sharing session across the whole OMV Group. This will be continued regularly in 2024.\n- In 2023, action close out focus audits were performed to ensure the continuous improvement process. The specific objectives were to audit the close out of actions resulting from incident investigations and to audit the sharing within the organization and to contractors of (technical/safety) alerts and lessons learned. Regrettably, however, one of our contractor colleagues at an OMV-operated venture lost their life in 2023 during the course of their work for OMV. The contractor colleague in Romania died from injuries sustained during a fire. OMV feels this loss deeply and are determined to learn from this incident, and do everything possible to prevent anything similar from happening again. We continue to work closely with our contractors to help build a strong safety culture at the front line.\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/10 description: The image is a bar chart comparing the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked for employees and contractors from 2019 to 2023. The x-axis represents the years from 2019 to 2023. The y-axis represents the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked. For employees, the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.51 in 2019, 0.43 in 2020, 0.70 in 2021, 1.13 in 2022, and 1.04 in 2023. For contractors, the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.27 in 2019, 0.27 in 2020, 0.51 in 2021, 0.62 in 2022, and 0.80 in 2023. The total number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.34 in 2019, 0.32 in 2020, 0.57 in 2021, 0.78 in 2022, and 0.87 in 2023.\n\n\\* 2022 figure restated due to reclassification of a case after the audit in 2023.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nThe HSSE strategy is implemented by means of annual plans and targets. In a combined top-down and bottom-up process, 43 local annual HSSE plans are developed and monitored centrally.\n\nThe occupational safety focus points for the 2024 HSSE plan include:\n\n## **Total Recordable Injury Rate**\n\nPer 1 mn hours worked\n\n- improvements in HSSE culture,\n- motivational management,\n- training and competencies,\n- contractor performance and subcontractor management, and\n- safe behavior and compliance.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The fundamental components of this include our organization, resources, management processes, people and equipment performance, the prevailing safety culture, and documented regulations and practices. It covers the management of hazards associated with the chemical and physical properties of the substances we handle in our oil, gas, and chemical activities. OMV and Borealis process large quantities of flammable and/or toxic materials at high pressures and temperatures that, if not properly handled, could potentially lead to serious process safety incidents. In a worst-case scenario, leaks, fires, or explosions could also cause fatalities. Further consequences include a substantial disruption to the supply to customers, along with additional costs. The OMV Group's Process Safety Management Standard serves as a framework and reference for the implementation and maintenance of effective process safety regulations.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has implemented comprehensive measures to ensure process safety, as detailed below.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nProcess safety risks are systematically assessed through a variety of process hazard assessments such as HAZOP studies, QRAs (Quantitative Risk Assessments), and risk assessments according to the Seveso Directive, which is the main EU regulation dealing with the control of onshore major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.\n\nRecommendations from process hazard analyses (PHAs), audits, reviews, and incident investigations addressing process safety risks are centrally recorded and prioritized systematically in the OMV Group Integrated Risk Register. This is linked to the mid-term planning process to ensure there is budget available to address the recommendations.\n\nPrior to the start-up of a new facility, after major modifications, or following a turnaround, we conduct an independent pre-start-up safety review to ensure that the facility is safe for start-up and operations.\n\n#### **Emergency Management Plans**\n\nProcess safety incidents could at times affect communities in the vicinity of our operations. For this reason, we have robust emergency management plans in place that are coordinated with the surrounding communities.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nDifferent levels of emergency management plans outline roles and responsibilities, structures, communications, and the interfaces required for emergency and incident management teams. Emergency response plans include specific emergency procedures and alerting and notification requirements to ensure that an emergency response is managed in a coordinated manner.\n\n#### **Inspection and Maintenance**\n\nComprehensive inspection and maintenance programs are carried out by dedicated departments for inspection, maintenance, and plant integrity. They conduct regular inspections of process equipment, pipelines, tanks, and more, and manage safety equipment testing plus plant maintenance and turnarounds.\n\n#### **Investigations and Audits**\n\nAll incidents are identified and reported in an appropriate and timely manner. Work-related incidents with potential consequences for people, the environment, assets, or our reputation are investigated in a suitable manner to determine direct causes, root causes, and systemic causes so we can learn from them and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events<sup>21</sup> are measured each year for a consistent overview of the OMV Group's process safety performance. In addition to Tier 1 and 2 process safety incidents, we monitor Tier 3 process safety events for a better assessment of the critical barriers. The monitoring and reporting of Tier 3 events provides an overview of the challenges to safety systems so that weaknesses within the barriers can be identified and corrected at facility level.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nEmployee competence in the field of process safety is ensured by a well-defined training plan, as well as continuous communication of process safety topics and the sharing of lessons learned and other relevant process safety information. Scenario-based emergency drills involving the site emergency management team are conducted periodically in the refineries in addition to regular drills carried out by the fire service.\n\nWe have set up an OMV Group Process Safety Network and created an online collaboration platform that includes a reference library, discussion board, and other features. We host regular virtual sessions to exchange process safety knowledge across the Group, with participants coming from a variety of OMV countries and working in different fields of expertise. This helps foster continuous learning. Top management participation in these online sessions sends a clear message that process safety is important and demonstrates process safety leadership and commitment.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn 2023, the number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events increased slightly. The following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Process Safety Events, Tier 1 and Tier 2**\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/14 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Number of events\". The x-axis shows the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The y-axis shows the number of events. There are two categories of events, Tier 1 and Tier 2. In 2019, there were 4 Tier 1 events and 7 Tier 2 events. In 2020, there were 6 Tier 1 events and 13 Tier 2 events. In 2021, there were 10 Tier 1 events and 17 Tier 2 events. In 2022, there were 9 Tier 1 events and 16 Tier 2 events. In 2023, there were 12 Tier 1 events and 15 Tier 2 events.\n\n- A register containing risk reduction measures identified in various process hazard analyses (PHAs), assessments, and safety studies was established in each operated production unit and was populated with data, including from Borealis sites. This provides a consolidated overview to support prioritization and further development of risk reduction plans.\n- The key process safety performance indicators (PSPI) were updated for the OMV Group, and a dashboard was developed to inform management.\n- The Advanced Risk Assessment (ARA) software, a cloud-based tool for process hazard analyses, recommendation tracking, and workflows, was rolled out at OMV.\n- A process safety management (PSM) assessment was carried out offshore in OMV's Energy business segment.\n- A safety deep dive on pre-start-up safety review (PSSR) and pressure testing hazard control in the Schwechat refinery was conducted.\n- Periodic Group Process Safety Committee meetings with Executive Board member involvement took place, where process safety performance, achievements, and challenges were on the agenda.\n- The Group-wide process safety knowledge- and experience-sharing platform was continued, with quarterly half-day events where up to 200 individuals participate in virtual meetings and presentations, including contributions from senior management. The yearly Process Safety Day, a full-day event of sharing experiences and learning, was also held.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/1 description: The image shows a paragraph of text describing the OMV Energy segment. The text states that the OMV Energy segment completed a digital Maintenance and Integrity Dashboard that provides an overview of compliance with safety-critical equipment maintenance while also displaying up-to-date maintenance statistics.\n\n- The OMV Energy segment has been utilizing the newest technologies on the market to inspect pipelines that are usually difficult to access.\n- Tier 1 and 2 analyses were performed at Borealis. The results were presented to the Borealis Process Safety Committee and key focus areas were identified based on the analysis.\n- Borealis carried out a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) in Beringen, and the results were communicated to the local management team (LLT). An action plan is being developed.\n- At Borealis, \"blue audits\" were conducted as planned at the following sites: Burghausen (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), Stenungsund HC & PO (Sweden), and Itatiba (Brazil). The results will be presented to the local management teams and the Operation Assurance Committee.\n- Borealis started the rollout of a Process Safety Roadmap, which is a five-year plan of critical Process Safety activities needed to close identified gaps in process safety management, in a structured way across all locations, followed by training.\n- Borealis continued to develop the Group's process safety competency by conducting Process Safety in Design and Hazard Study Leader training and following up with Process Safety Basics e-learning, which the OMV Group shared with Borealis.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nTo continue to improve our process safety performance, we will take the following actions in the coming years:\n\n- We will continue to thoroughly analyze and learn from process safety events and promote the sharing of knowledge across all our divisions.\n- We aim to reduce the number of process safety events at all our sites across the globe. Our continued efforts will focus on process hazard analyses (PHAs), the implementation of technical risk reduction measures identified in those PHAs, audits, and other process safety assessments, while maintaining and monitoring the performance of existing safeguards.\n- We will continue to develop and follow process safety roadmaps, i.e., five-year plans with activities in the area of process safety, at facility level, and to define and plan necessary process safety activities for upcoming years. Process safety roadmaps help to ensure that key aspects of the process safety management system are delivered.\n- We will enhance our tools to identify and assess hazards more effectively and address these risks in a systematic way.\n- We will continually improve our training provision and will emphasize process safety content to build process safety competence and culture in the workforce and increase risk awareness.\n- Borealis will continue process safety event (PSE) Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysis and expand it to Tier 3 events, including an impact assessment to identify the greatest opportunities for risk reduction and develop an action plan.\n- The Borealis HSSE group will perform internal health checks on process safety-related elements and a process safety review as part of the Borealis blue audits.\n- Borealis will conduct Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) in Stenungsund, Sweden, to evaluate all possible release scenarios in terms of probability and consequences, and to identify risk profiles at various locations inside and outside the site, with the aim of reducing the overall exposure of employees and contractors.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The most relevant SDG is SDG 3, which is \"Good Health and Well-Being\", represented by a logo with a heart and a heartbeat line.\n\n**SDG target:**\n\n**3.9** By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination\n\n## Product Safety\n\nOMV assumes responsibility for delivering safe, highquality products. At the same time, we continuously work on exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of the life cycle of our products. We take a holistic approach to product safety, with technologically advanced solutions used to deliver safe, top-quality products, at the same time as taking action to ensure the responsible use of our products.\n\nProduct safety is also particularly important for our C&M segment, which encompasses our chemicals subsidiary Borealis. When not properly handled, chemical substances, or products containing them, can pose risks to health, safety, and the environment. These risks include potentially negative health effects such as sensitization, irritation, or intoxication; physical hazards such as fires, explosions, or exposure to dust; and environmental hazards such as bioaccumulation or persistence.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur internal Management of Hazardous Substances standard stipulates measures to ensure regulatory compliance and guarantee that risk assessments are conducted for all products or for hazardous substances contained in products.\n\n#### **REACH Compliance**\n\nWe have established appropriate processes and workflows to ensure our compliance with EU regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) and on the Classification, Labelling, and Packaging (CLP) of substances and mixtures, as well as with\n\nthe Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States. We are committed to maintaining and updating our mandatory registrations to keep up with relevant regulatory developments. To this end, we closely follow the guidance published by the European Chemicals Agency and participate in the REACH consortia (Concawe, Lower Olefins and Aromatics, Fuel Ethers, Co-processed Refinery Products, Phenol and Derivatives, Melamine, FARM [Fertilizer and Related Materials], Eurogypsum, etc.), as well as in working groups through oil and chemical industry trade associations.\n\nIn addition to keeping REACH registrations up to date, Borealis also follows the developments on authorizations and restrictions under REACH, such as the planned restriction with regards to synthetic polymer microparticles (better known as microplastics). The drafted restriction foresees a ban on placing products containing microplastics on the market but derogates the use of plastic pellets on industrial sites. However, there are planned supply chain communication and reporting obligations toward the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) that will apply for Borealis polyolefin products.\n\n#### **Banned Substances**\n\nBorealis has a Banned Substances List that contains more than 220 substances and substance groups that may not be used in our production processes and products. The Banned Substances List can be found on the [Borealis web](https://www.borealisgroup.com/company/chemicals-safety/hazardous-chemicals/borealis-banned-substances)[site.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/company/chemicals-safety/hazardous-chemicals/borealis-banned-substances)\n\n#### **Responsible Care®**\n\nBorealis is committed to the principles of Responsible Care® and enforces high product stewardship standards to\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nensure that its products do not pose a risk at any stage along the value chain.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nBorealis has adopted a hazardous chemicals strategy. This follows the precautionary principle of continuously assessing the risk potential of all substances used in Borealis' products to identify critical chemicals no longer permitted to be used or that can be replaced by safer alternatives. This includes all substances that were already classified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) according to REACH and other comparable legislation outside the EU, or that fulfill the criteria to be considered as SVHCs in the future. The risk evaluation utilizes a tailormade analysis and assessment tool that ranks the substances according to their overall risk. It considers related HSE risks and regulatory aspects, evolving stakeholder concerns, the technical feasibility of substitution, and the financial consequences of doing so, such as the costs of required innovation, approval, and modifications to technical equipment. Substances with the highest identified risk are further assessed by the Product Stewardship Council. The Council selects the substances to be evaluated using the Borealis Risk Matrix, which is a proprietary ranking tool to evaluate risks in detail. These assessments enable Borealis to identify, mitigate, and manage the risks posed by hazardous chemicals.\n\n#### **Quality Control**\n\nAll incoming chemicals used in Borealis' products are assessed, rated, and documented to ensure legal compliance before they are approved for use. Local teams then perform additional assessments at each plant to ensure the chemicals meet plant-specific requirements and comply with national or community-related legislation. This process ensures that the procurement organization does not purchase any substance before Group Product Stewardship has reviewed and approved it. Once materials are approved for purchase, they are subject to Borealis' quality control measures to ensure they continue to comply with the agreed material properties. Detailed information is documented for all materials regarding their composition and their hazardous constituents. Proper documentation of the raw materials used is a key element of high-quality Borealis product compliance statements, such as safety data sheets (SDSs) and application-related statements, including those on medical use, food contact, drinking water, and the origin of raw materials.\n\n#### **Safety Data Sheets**\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) are available on the [OMV](http://www.omv.com/en/products/online-tools/product-information) and [Borealis](https://www.borealisgroup.com/products/product-catalogue) websites. These documents are regulated under REACH and include comprehensive information on potential health, safety, and environmental issues. In addition, they inform customers and employees about how to handle and use our products safely. Borealis actively follows its suppliers' SDSs and the harmonized classification process to ensure it always has accurate and upto-date SDS and label information for our products.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe OMV Group aims to become a global leader in circular economy solutions with a strong focus on increasing the use of sustainable fuels (e.g., Sustainable Aviation Fuel; SAF) and renewable feedstocks.\n\nBorealis' activities regarding the circular economy and exploring sustainable feedstock result in new product safety and compliance aspects to consider and solve. Both existing and planned legal frameworks, for example following the EU Commission's Green Deal, require industry and brand owners to use post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials for their products. Group Product Stewardship is providing support by generating an overview of applicable legislation and available industry standards to produce a risk assessment and analytical testing strategy so we can confirm compliance and the suitability of Borealis' Circular Economy Solutions portfolio.\n\n#### In 2023, Borealis\n\n- categorized different types of recyclate feedstock for mechanical recycling and defined the required compliance and safety documents and analytical testing for each category;\n- used a newly implemented IT tool to report relevant products to the EU Poison Centres, prior to the deadline for industrial use mixtures with certain human health hazards;\n- prepared registration dossiers for about 50% of the substances imported to Turkey, enabling continued market access for Borealis' product portfolio after the official postponement of the registration deadline from end 2023 to 2026 and beyond;\n- assessed and implemented the new requirements for plastics that come into contact with food in the EU, Switzerland, China, Japan, and the Mercosur region across its food contact product portfolio by providing updated Declaration of Compliance with Food Contact Regulations documents to customers; and\n- confirmed that all substances in Borealis products that come into contact with drinking water are listed in the draft positive list for starting materials, additives, and process chemicals for such materials in the EU.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

All icons are blue.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nOur Group objective is to drive sustainability by minimizing the potential hazards and risks associated with our portfolio. In 2024, the OMV Group will:\n\ngenerate and provide data to enable the EU authorities to make informed decisions on legislation that is under review, such as the REACH Regulation, the Food Contact Regulation, and the Drinking Water Directive and its national implementation;\n\n## Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience\n\n- continue to implement the requirements of new legislation globally, including continued preparation work for registration in Turkey, registration of 100–1,000 t substances in South Korea, and support for customers in Taiwan with the registration of PEC 1 substances; and\n- ensure that REACH registrations for cracker feedstock also cover higher percentages of alternative non-fossil feedstock than currently described by the Concawe consortium.\n\n#### **Material Topic: Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience**\n\nProtecting people, assets, operations, information, and reputation against any threats, incidents, or crises, thereby ensuring business continuity\n\n- GRI 410: Security Practices 2016\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\nGRI 410: Security Practices 2016 Employee and social concerns\n\n#### **Most relevant SDG**\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/16 description: The image is a square with a blue background. In the upper left corner is the number 16 in white. To the right of the number is the text \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\" in white. Below the text is a white dove holding an olive branch in its beak. Below the dove is a white gavel.\n\nThe purpose of OMV's security activities is to protect the OMV Group's personnel, assets, information, operations, value, and reputation against threats. The Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience material topic encompasses two facets: corporate physical security and information security.\n\nOMV's core commitments to security are laid out in the HSSE Policy. We protect against crime, malicious acts arising from geopolitical threats, and business crime. Furthermore, we develop resilience to respond to and recover from incidents and ensure business continuity.\n\n#### Governance\n\nGroup HSSE is responsible for coordinating physical security and resilience activities across the OMV Group. Group HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. In high-risk countries, we have dedicated Country Security Managers and Asset Protection Experts on site to add additional expertise. IT Security is handled by the Group IT & Digital Office led by the Chief Information Officer. The CIO reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The Group CIO is\n\nsupported by the Group CISO and Group IT/OT Governance team.\n\n### Corporate Security\n\nAn unstable geopolitical environment in 2023 combined with complex new and ongoing regional conflicts, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe, resulted in Corporate Security continuing to invest significant resources in ensuring resilience and security in areas that we had previously considered low risk, but without losing focus on our employees and assets in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to the challenges of operating securely in Yemen, Tunisia, and Libya, the enduring threat of terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere has not diminished. Political extremism, organized crime, and the increasing convergence of cyber risks with physical threats necessitated the Corporate Security department's unrelenting focus on a robust yet flexible security strategy to enable OMV to continue operating in dynamic environments with asymmetric threats.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group's internal Security Management Standard lays out a comprehensive range of security regulations, plans, procedures, measures, and systems. The document utilizes the IOGP best practice guidelines, along with other industry best practice (ASIS and UK Security Institute), to enable the OMV Group to more effectively detect, deter, protect against, prevent, record, and investigate threats. Corporate guidelines on Issue Motivated Groups (IMGs) were updated, as was a position paper on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nThe OMV Group has a unique, agile, and proven security management system that is regularly reviewed, amended, or enhanced as the situation requires.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nThe philosophy of collecting security information and assessing it as a preventive security instrument remains a fundamental principle of the Corporate Security strategy. This concept affords us the ability to anticipate or instantly respond to a broad spectrum of geopolitical events, regional conflicts, and isolated incidents. Effective interaction with government and local security agencies further augments this approach with the reliable corroboration of facts on the ground.\n\nOMV's security risk assessment platform continues to provide real-time oversight of OMV's asset risk exposure levels and can be quickly adjusted in response to geopolitical or security events, as well as enabling the dissemination of security-critical information in real time.\n\n#### **Human Rights and Community Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group's human rights policies and actions remain crucial to guaranteeing a secure and harmonious working environment. We provide human rights training to local security employees and third-party contractors. Effective community engagement at a local level remains a powerful security mitigation measure in regions experiencing conflict or instability. In high-risk countries, OMV's local security and community engagement strategies are tightly integrated, promoting effective policies, mutual respect, and transparency with all local stakeholders. In turn, they contributed directly to OMV's stable and secure operating environment in 2023. This cooperation encourages a precautionary approach to early detection and resolution of local grievances.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness of security practices within OMV's business units, the OMV Corporate Security function conducts audits every year for those ventures deemed high risk (for 2023 this was Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen). Two other major audits are conducted annually, with business units being chosen based on operational requirements. In 2023, the selected areas were OMV NZ and the OMV DE Burghausen refinery and associated Tank Farms.\n\nTerms of Reference are agreed with the business unit prior to commencing the audit. A thorough review then takes place including site visits, interviews, document analysis, and observations. An audit report is then drafted, shared, agreed, and published. The report will include SMART actions, with the entire process being tracked via OMV's HSSE tool Synergi.\n\n#### **Resilience**\n\nIn the OMV Group, the term \"resilience\" covers incident, emergency, crisis, and business continuity management and, even though the Resilience function sits within the Group Security & Resilience department, the focus is not exclusively on security incidents. It covers all sorts of events involving people, environment, assets, information, and reputation, where the OMV Group has legal, ethical, or community responsibilities, or business interests.\n\nAccording to the Group-wide Resilience Standard, the OMV Group uses a three-tier approach for the management of incidents, emergencies, and crises by way of dedicated teams at different levels of the organization (Incident Management Teams, Emergency Management Teams, Crisis Management Teams). The key priorities in any such situation are to:\n\n- Protect and save life through a strong focus on the ability to account for people\n- Minimize damage to the environment\n- Protect assets and information from further damage\n- Minimize business interruptions\n- Minimize financial and legal liability\n- Protect or enhance reputation\n\nIn order to maintain a high level of preparedness, the incident, emergency, and crisis management plans and procedures are tested and the respective team members trained and exercised at regular intervals.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe Corporate Security department continued to deliver operational support to OMV ventures globally, as well as surge capacity during security challenges. In high-risk countries, OMV also utilized dedicated Country Security Managers and Asset Protection Experts on site to enhance\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

This set of tools provides guidance on risk assessment, public safety and security, human rights abuses, and the interaction between companies and private and public security. OMV is committed to upholding human rights in all of its activities. In 2023, OMV Corporate Security completed its application to VPSHR and attended its annual conference in London. OMV is currently awaiting the results of its application.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nOMV will continue its engagement with the VPSHR initiative and aims to become a dedicated member.\n\n### Information and Cybersecurity\n\nIn an increasingly interconnected global environment, information is exposed to a rapidly growing variety of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. The OMV Group invests in information and cybersecurity to protect technology, assets, critical information, and our reputation, and to avoid any damage or financial loss resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and data. Keeping the OMV Group free of security vulnerabilities and potential security risks is essential for the whole business.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur internal IT23/OT<sup>24</sup> Security Directive lays out the details of the IT/OT Security Framework, through which topic- or security domain-related security standards and policies are continually aligned and managed. The Security Framework consists of approximately 50 regulatory documents in total and is harmonized with the ISO 27000 series (ISO27k) of recommendations for IT controls and domains. It also covers OMV's commitment to securing the operation of its services in dedicated areas, such as within the filling stations retail business and the related PCI DSS<sup>25</sup> requirements.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nWe run an Information Security Management System (ISMS), which is based on ISO27k standards and certified accordingly, with external monitoring and recertification processes carried out annually. A full recertification assessment was successfully completed in July 2022 and the OMV certification period was extended until 2025. One of the basic principles of an ISMS is incorporating a continuous improvement cycle in order to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remediate potential information security leaks or weaknesses.\n\n#### **Preventive, Technical, Detective, and Reactive Measures**\n\nWe lower the risk of security breaches by introducing new tools, individual detection strategies, and response plans in order to maintain a strong perimeter for our physical and our cloud environment.\n\nTechnical housekeeping measures ensure a solid foundation with up-to-date hardware and software, as well as adequate information security processes. We implement security patches and offer guidelines in order to provide consistent hardware and software life cycles.\n\nDetective and reactive measures are designed and executed on an ongoing basis to create transparency around existing risks, security gaps, and vulnerabilities. In order to protect our assets and keep intruders out, we integrate detective and reactive measures to mitigate possible damage and take remediation measures to ensure a fast and total recovery. Examples of such measures include:\n\n- Permanent vulnerability scans on cyber assets\n- Breach and attack simulations to evaluate potential attack surfaces\n- Running continuous internal and external penetration tests on critical applications/systems\n- External audits as quality assurance (ISO27k, PCI-DSS NIS, etc.)\n\n#### **Training**\n\nWe run regular and intensive training sessions to keep our employees' information security awareness at an adequate level. The awareness efforts are either based on general topics of information security interest, ad hoc demands as timely countermeasures on dedicated use cases, or even target-group-focused topics, and are based on different formats, such as:\n\n- Mandatory e-learning sessions including knowledge check\n- Topic-based videos\n- Classroom training sessions\n- Anti-phishing email campaigns\n- \"My News\" platform to share news via the intranet and internal blog posts\n\n<sup>25</sup> Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\n\n<sup>23</sup> Information Technology (IT) Security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets, such as computers, networks, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of sophisticated hackers.\n\n<sup>24</sup> OT Security is defined as Operational Technology (OT) hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes, and events in the enterprise. OT is common in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), such as a SCADA system.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Incident Reporting and Escalation Processes**\n\nOMV operates continuous 24/7 security monitoring. Potential findings are processed via Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) intelligence and supplemented by Level 1, 2, and 3 analysts. Escalation procedures exist to ensure timely remediation of security incidents on a 24/7 basis. OMV's Cyber Defense team classifies incidents and triggers the incident response process, then activates all required functions via automatic and manual alerts sent by voice message and SMS. All remediation actions follow predefined \"runbooks\" in order to ensure efficient and timely processing. A clear communication plan ensures the proper information is disseminated to all relevant stakeholders.\n\n#### **Business Continuity/Contingency Plans and Incident Response Procedures**\n\nOMV tests its business continuity plans and incident response procedures annually through cyber emergency exercises. The cyber emergency exercises, which are run with external experts, focus on specific, realistic threat scenarios in order to test related mitigation procedures and processes. The tabletop exercise consists of a series of \"injects.\" Each inject represents an event or a piece of information that is discovered as the scenario unfolds and is related to the security incident at hand. The audience of this scenario usually consists of up to 30 participants, including representatives from the IT Security, superior IT Management, and OT Security teams, among others. After each inject, a corresponding review and evaluation of the process is conducted, including an appraisal determining lessons learned.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n**0** noteworthy cyber security incidents\n\nA holistic cyber security crisis exercise was conducted covering realistic threat scenarios alongside IT and OT areas.\n\nApproximately **65** different types of awareness measures were conducted (e.g., classroom exercises, online training sessions, and email phishing campaigns).\n\nThe **ISO 27000** certification (Information Security Management System) was re-audited and confirmed.\n\nApproximately **400** IT projects were guided by the IT security governance function to ensure defined security requirements are covered, thereby protecting OMV assets according to their protection needs.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nThe OMV Group is dedicated to continuous improvement processes and implementing related measures. The strategic aim is to further increase the IT security maturity level and extend cyber defense capabilities and threat resilience beyond the already established high level. Existing certifications should be renewed or validated in order to ensure external quality checks and assurance. Additional focus remains on the context of the emerging IT and OT areas, especially in light of cyberattacks, to secure critical infrastructure assets and facilities from both functional perspectives.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of circles.

We are aware that the energy transition also brings with it social impacts. OMV is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities and addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\nOur operations impact our employees and the communities where we operate. These impacts can be positive, for example employment opportunities, fostering local businesses, and infrastructure, as well as negative, for example competition for land use, dust production, privacy, and community dependence on the Company, among other things. Our social license to operate is based on upholding human and labor rights and developing positive relationships with our employees and communities.\n\nWe are committed to building and retaining a talented, sustainable expert team of employees for international and integrated growth to meet today's challenges and adapt for tomorrow. OMV is committed to ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees and has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind. We embrace our differences and use our diversity of thought and experience as a catalyst for growth and creativity. With our People & Culture (P&C) Strategy, we are ensuring the transformation of the OMV Group will be a success by adapting our current ways to fit with our new aspirations. Building on our capability, we are reinventing how we lead and our way of working, and growing our network of experts, because \"People make it happen.\" In 2023, we introduced our new OMV Group Values \"We care | We're curious | We progress,\" which will guide us on our path to a more sustainable future. Our values underpin our culture and signal what is important to us. Building a corporate culture based on these values will give us a competitive advantage, enable new and enhanced ways of working, and pave the way to becoming a net zero-company by 2050.\n\nThe People strategic focus area combines our commitments and actions relating to our employees and communities under one umbrella. Our approach begins with ensuring that the human rights of our employees, contractors and communities are upheld – efforts that are described in the \"Human Rights\" material topic. The \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\" \"Employees,\" and \"Communities\" material topics then further outline how we ensure those rights are realized, whether economic, social, or cultural.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nThe OMV Group holds itself responsible for respecting the human rights of our employees, as well as those of people directly impacted by or involved with our business, for example our suppliers and contractors, communities, indigenous peoples, and the society in which we live and operate our business. Our responsibilities in the area of human rights include, and are not limited to, equality and non-discrimination, decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, security, primary health care, labor rights in the supply chain, education, poverty reduction, land rights, and free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). We specifically concentrate on the impact of our activities on the human rights of individuals and groups that are more likely to be in vulnerable situations, such as indigenous peoples, women, and children.\n\n## Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nOur Code of Conduct and the [OMV Group Human Rights](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522232974703/omv-group-human-rights-policy-statement.pdf) [Policy Statement](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522232974703/omv-group-human-rights-policy-statement.pdf), which are both approved by the Executive Board, set out our understanding of and responsibility for respecting and realizing human rights in our business environment. Our Human Rights Policy Statement includes detailed descriptions of our specific human rights commitments, e.g., related to workers' rights, vulnerable groups, and security, as well as our commitment to contributing to a Just Transition.<sup>26</sup> Borealis and OMV Petrom have developed their Human Rights Policy Statements based on the OMV Group's statement, and both have been approved by the CEO and Executive Board respectively.\n\nThe OMV Group respects and supports human rights as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in internationally recognized treaties, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO). OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis have signed the UN Global Compact and are fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. This includes a commitment to upholding labor rights, such as decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, and provisions against forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking. We therefore fully support the aims of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are committed to operating our business and supply chain free from forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. The OMV [Statement on Modern Slavery and](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522204527328/dload_Statement_slavery_trafficking_2020_EN) [Human Trafficking](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522204527328/dload_Statement_slavery_trafficking_2020_EN) explains in detail the countermeasures taken in all parts of the business and supply chain.\n\nIn addition to these commitments to international norms, we have further mapped out our human rights responsibilities in a comprehensive Human Rights Matrix, which is designed to serve as the foundation for our activities in this area. The OMV Group Human Rights Matrix covers responsibilities in the areas detailed below. The management of these commitments is further defined in a number of internal directives and regulations, such as the Community Relations and Community Development handbook available for all CSR focal points within the OMV Group, the Human Rights Management System, and our Community Grievance Procedure.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a thorough revision of our OMV Group Human Rights Management in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as any new or upcoming legal requirements, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and other regulations related to mandatory human rights due diligence. With the revision of the human rights due diligence steps and the reformulation of roles and responsibilities, we aim to improve the integration of human rights into our overall risk management processes and across all functions.\n\nWe have also reviewed in detail our Human Rights Matrix, which forms the heart of the OMV Group Human Rights Management System and describes our concrete human rights responsibilities (for more details, see Human Rights Matrix).\n\n#### **Equality and Non-Discrimination**\n\nThis includes the implementation of appropriate guidelines and awareness raising. Read more about our approach to this topic in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\n#### **Security**\n\nThis includes preventive, defensive, and community-oriented approaches to security, clear guidelines, supervision, and training, all in line with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Read more about our approach to this topic in Corporate Security.\n\n#### **Health and Safety**\n\nThis includes the OMV Group's health and safety management as well as community arrangements. Read more about our approach to this topic in Health, Safety, and Well-Being.\n\n#### **Labor Rights**\n\nThis includes decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, collective bargaining, and provisions against forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking. We support the \"five fundamental principles and rights at work\" outlined in the ILO Declaration. We are committed to respecting workers' rights, in line with ILO's fundamental Conventions on rights at work, and we expect our contractors, suppliers, and the joint ventures we participate in to do the same. Where local labor rights standards fall short of the OMV Group's standards, based on international human rights law, the OMV Group is guided by its higher standards unless this is forbidden by law.\n\n<sup>&</sup>quot;Just Transition\" refers to addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy as stated in the Guidelines of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for a just transition. 26\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nThe OMV Group strives to be a fair and responsible employer. Upholding and promoting labor rights is essential to achieving legal compliance in a local and international environment. It is also essential to ensuring that our global workforce can develop professionally and fulfill their personal aspirations in line with our business needs.\n\n#### **Working Hours and Flexibility**\n\nWe are committed to complying with applicable local working time and overtime payment provisions, which is essential for a professional working environment. Parttime work is offered. In general, our part-time employees are entitled to the same benefits as full-time employees, except where benefits are linked to the amount of time worked (e.g., number of home office days per month, with full-time employees being entitled to more home office days than part-time employees). In line with local legal provisions, we offer further flexible work options such as special part-time work for certain age groups and workfrom-home options that provide greater time flexibility for our staff. We offer various forms of long- and short-term breaks from work such as sabbaticals and parental and other care leave.\n\n#### **Operational Changes and Minimum Notice Periods**\n\nOur personnel policy is based on long-term employment. Both staff and the organization should benefit from long-term working relationships. We are also aware that job security represents a major concern not only for the individual employee, but also for society and the region concerned, and we therefore make every effort to live up to these responsibilities by means of contingency planning. Where business, organizational, or security changes require adaptations in the workplace, or even a termination of employment, we evaluate all the options, engage in constructive dialogue, and respond with the maximum possible care and sensitivity. Almost all of our employees are covered by mandatory notice periods under employment law or collective bargaining agreements in the event of restructuring. In situations where, despite training, transfer, or development programs, staff release becomes unavoidable, we make every effort to consider the economic and social consequences of those affected. We are committed to complying with local legislation regarding minimum notice periods in each country where we operate.\n\n#### **Wages**\n\nWe are committed to locally applicable decent living wage standards. For almost all of our employees, minimum wages or salaries are fixed by law or agreed by way of collective bargaining.\n\n#### **Right to Education**\n\nThis includes employee training and support for basic education in the surrounding communities. Read more about\n\nour approach to this topic in Skills Development and Training and Community Investments.\n\n#### **Property and Standard of Living, Including Land Rights and Poverty Reduction**\n\nWe adhere to international best practices, which require avoiding involuntary resettlement, or at least keeping it to a minimum. Where resettlement is unavoidable, all people affected should be compensated fully and fairly. We are committed to a fair and transparent procedure for land use and compensation to local communities or authorities. If exploration, development, or production activities have the potential to impact communities, and/or their land, we consult with all relevant stakeholders ahead of time and obtain permission to use the land either temporarily or permanently.\n\n#### **Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples**\n\nWe are committed to community consultation based on free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) in accordance with IFC Performance Standard 7 and ILO Convention 169. We are aware of indigenous communities in the proximity of our operations in Māui, Pohokura, and Maari in New Zealand, as well as in the Arma district in Yemen. Read more about our approach to engaging with our communities in Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\n#### **Privacy and Family Life**\n\nThis includes personal data protection and appropriate living and working conditions. An internal data protection directive is in effect for our employees, and we adhere to a public [data protection policy](https://www.omv.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/data-protection) regarding the processing of personal data. The OMV Group is aware that specific circumstances of operations in the field (remote locations away from family, residence in camps, etc.) potentially impact rights to privacy and to family life. Therefore, we apply the principles of necessity and proportionality regarding our employees' living and working conditions.\n\n#### **Environment and Climate Change**\n\nThe OMV Group recognizes the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a human right that is intrinsically linked to a wide range of other human rights. With our OMV Strategy 2030, we are fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, acting on responsible resources management, and minimizing the environmental impacts of our operations.\n\nCognizant of the social impacts that the energy transition entails, the OMV Group is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities, and to addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### Governance\n\nIn 2023, we took major steps to entrench accountability for human rights in our Company leadership. The Corporate Human Rights Experts team has been integrated into the Group Sustainability Team, which reports to the CFO. Our CEO continues to be the key owner of the topic of human rights, with the CFO being a co-owner. We continued our biannual human rights briefings with the CEO and CFO. They are both personally briefed about our main achievements and challenges related to our human rights impact at least twice a year (and whenever critical concerns arise). The main topics of discussion during the 2023 briefing sessions included principal achievements, major gaps and next steps of our human rights management approach, human rights compliance in contractor management, human rights grievances, the annual human rights risk ranking, the Human Rights Self-Assessment (HRSA) at Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO), the Community Grievance Mechanism (CGM) Assessment at OMV Tunisia, and our results of the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark. At the end of 2022, the OMV Group renewed its commitment to human rights with the formal approval of our revised OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement by the OMV Executive Board.\n\nBelow Board level, accountability for our compliance with human rights lies with the respective countries' business heads. Locally based human rights focal persons conduct due diligence at the operating facilities with the support of five human rights experts at Group level (at OMV, SapuraOMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis) plus a team of four Social Compliance Experts at Borealis. Action plans and mitigation measures are implemented and reported by the respective functions, depending on which aspect of human rights is in question. Thus, the People & Culture (P&C) department deals with human rights issues related to labor rights, the Procurement department steers the management of human rights issues in supplier relationships, the HSSE department is responsible for health, safety, and security-related human rights issues, and the corporate Community Relations and Development function oversees OMV responsibilities related to the human rights impact on communities and indigenous peoples.\n\n### Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\nThe human rights due diligence process involves assessing the human rights risk associated with our current and future business activities and taking risk management actions. This ongoing process uses external resources and expertise, which includes external stakeholders, particularly those from impacted groups.\n\n#### **Human Rights Matrix**\n\nSince 2008, we have mapped out our human rights responsibilities in a comprehensive Human Rights Matrix designed to serve as the foundation for our activities in this area. We use this tool to assess our human rights challenges and activities, and prioritize our actions as essential, expected, or desirable in defense of human rights. In 2023, we initiated a review of the Human Rights Matrix as a follow-up to our review of the OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement in the previous year. Keeping the overall structure of our Human Rights Matrix, we aim to improve the alignment of its content and language with international human rights due diligence standards and legislation. The updates will reflect the increasing responsibility of companies and better incorporate the most salient issues.\n\nAt all stages of the human rights due diligence process, we use the OMV Group Human Rights Matrix as a common standard, mapping out reality on the ground against the specific responsibilities as defined in the matrix, and identifying any gaps we need to focus on. This approach helps us identify any potential human rights impact of our business activities, whether it relates to non-discrimination and diversity, labor-related issues (e.g., decent living wage standards and adequate break times), indigenous peoples' rights, or human rights in the supply chain.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nThe OMV Group has developed due diligence tools and techniques to assess the risk of human rights violations<sup>27</sup> related to our business, even before we launch or acquire business in a new country. Human rights are one of the components considered when making the decision to engage in a new country. The relevant human rights risks are presented to the respective Executive Board member to factor into the decision on whether or not to enter a country. We use these assessments to derive concrete measures to reduce the risk of direct and indirect involvement in potential human rights violations. We also conduct regular assessments of our current operations to determine their exposure to the risk of human rights and labor rights violations.\n\nDue diligence starts with an initial risk ranking at country level: every country we operate in (or plan to operate in) is assessed based on comprehensive human-rights-related data and in consultation with internal experts. The countries are rated as low, medium, and high risk, countries with the greatest manageable risk, and \"no-go\" countries with unmanageable risk. Based on this rating, we develop our yearly work plan, defining further due diligence actions and human rights training. Internationally recognized third-party experts support the OMV Group in conducting due diligence on the Company's exposure to human rights\n\n<sup>27</sup> A human rights violation happens when OMV fails to respect, fulfill, and support the realization of human rights in relation to our business activities, or becomes complicit in human rights abuse as understood under current international law, and as committed to in our OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement and mapped out in our OMV Human Rights Matrix.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nrisks in countries with high human rights risks. In 2023, for example, external human rights experts supported our Human Rights Self-Assessment in Libya. We also conducted a country entry check that included assessments of human rights risks related to OMV's potential business activities in the country and proposals on concrete mitigation measures in case of positive entry. Compliance checks of about ten potential suppliers in renewable supply (renewable feedstock, GHG tickets, and renewable products such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) were also carried out. The purpose of these compliance checks is to find out if these suppliers have commitments, systems, and processes in place to comply with OMV's human rights commitments.\n\nWe additionally conduct dedicated country risk assessments regarding labor rights to determine and monitor the legal situation and future development. As well as monitoring relevant labor rights risks, we work closely with employee representatives depending on the type of risk and potential impacts. With our annual initial risk rating, we also identify countries with elevated risks<sup>28</sup> of severe human rights abuse such as forced labor, child labor, or restrictions on the freedom of association. Within our country portfolio, 12 out of 48<sup>29</sup> (25%) countries (e.g., Yemen, Libya, and Brazil) show an elevated risk of child labor. Some 18 out of 48 (38%) countries (e.g., Yemen, Libya, and China) have an elevated risk of forced labor. The freedom of association is generally limited in 14 out of 48 (29%) countries (e.g., UAE, China, and Malaysia). We inform the respective General Managers and Human Rights Focal Persons about the elevated risk levels in their countries and recommend specific mitigation measures, for example human rights training for employees and the integration of the mentioned human rights issues in contractor meetings.\n\n#### **Self-Assessments**\n\nThe Human Rights Self-Assessment is one of the tools we use to evaluate the effectiveness of our human rights due diligence approach. Such assessments create internal awareness, capture our self-perception of our human rights performance, and facilitate the identification of gaps and further actions. Based on the outcomes of these assessments, we offer, support such as further capacity building to local experts or encourage peer and business partner initiatives to tackle local challenges. In 2023, we followed up on our Human Rights Self-Assessment at Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO)30, which we conducted in 2022 with the support of external human rights experts. A detailed report produced by the experts was shared with the PARCO management along with key recommendations, which included:\n\n- Establishing a human rights management system that supports the identification, integration, tracking, and mitigation of human rights risks.\n- Building the capacity of PARCO's team and establishing functions dedicated to implementing human rights due diligence at PARCO.\n- Developing an operational level grievance mechanism that applies to external stakeholders.\n- Reviewing PARCO's policies and clearly committing to promoting equality in all aspects of the company.\n- Applying a human rights lens across processes and practices that focuses on right holders, including vulnerable groups.\n- Including a human rights clause in policies e.g., Code of Conduct & Ethics, Guiding Principles of PARCO. Developing and implementing procedures to address human rights risks in security, land acquisition, community health and safety, and the supply chain.\n- Leveraging CSR initiatives to engage stakeholders on the human rights impacts of operations.\n- Establishing policies that protect employees from reprisals.\n\nWe also conducted a Human Rights Self-Assessment exercise at OMV Libya and a detailed report was provided by the experts, which outlined the following recommendations:\n\n- Increase understanding of human rights risks related to assets, particularly taking into account workers and local communities.\n- Build the capacity of the in-country team and establish functions dedicated to implementing Human Rights Due Diligence and monitoring progress at OMV Libya and associated assets.\n- Explore ways to gain and exercise leverage with operators and the national oil company (NOC) in mitigating identified human rights impacts to the greatest extent possible.\n- Engage with key local stakeholders, including civil society, on human rights impacts and how best to manage them going forward.\n- Explore ways to engage with communities likely to be impacted by activities linked to assets.\n- Ensure follow-up and proper documentation of all OMV efforts for the above.\n\n#### **Training and Awareness Raising**\n\nWe pay special attention to training and raising awareness to bring our human rights commitment to life. We provide training on human rights, which helps equip our employees with an understanding of our human rights\n\n<sup>29</sup> In 2023, Russia was not included in the human rights risk ranking for the OMV Group.\n\n<sup>28</sup> Elevated risk countries are those identified with a risk level of \"high,\" \"greatest manageable,\" or \"no-go\" (out of five levels: low risk, medium risk, high risk, greatest manageable risk, no-go) in our initial risk rating.\n\nPak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) is a joint venture between the government of Pakistan (60%) and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (40%), through its Mubadala Investment Company (MIC). OMV holds a 10% stake via MIC in PARCO. 30\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons.

The third icon contains a right arrow.\n\nmanagement process and gives them a space to work on concrete operational issues and local challenges. Even though the key concepts of the OMV Group Human Rights Management are the same across all countries in which we operate, the training focal points and discussions vary significantly, ranging from human rights in armed conflict environments and the risk of the OMV Group's complicity to the OMV Group's human rights responsibilities in joint ventures, personal legal liability, and employees' human rights and grievances. In 2023, we launched a Human Rights Learning Path within our OMV Group Sustainability Academy. A total of 170 participants in six instructor-led sessions learned about human rights in general and within the business context, human rights at OMV, human rights of employees (our own as well as those of contractors and suppliers), human rights of external stakeholders, and human rights and security. The provision of additional resources (e.g., links to online webinars and reading materials from renowned external providers, such as ILO, UN, Ipieca, ICRC) allowed colleagues to delve further into specific topics, e.g., diversity and non-discrimination, labor conditions, forced labor, child labor, human trafficking, and other human rights issues.\n\nAll employees are strongly encouraged to complete our interactive e-learning course on human rights, which is part of the training curriculum for all our employees worldwide. In 2023, we promoted our newly launched human rights e-learning course, which guides employees through human rights norms and situations. The course provides a basic understanding of human rights in the business context and provides insight into our specific responsibilities, for example related to diversity and non-discrimination, labor rights of our own and contractors' employees, human rights in security setups, and the rights of our communities, as well as severe human rights violations such as child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. It also provides an insight into our due diligence tools and what to do in the event of observed or alleged human rights abuse. In 2023, Borealis launched a mandatory human rights e-learning course for the entire Borealis workforce in nine languages, covering all relevant human rights aspects and including transparent information and lessons learned related to the PDH Kallo incident in 2022. In addition, the Borealis ethics code of conduct e-learning covers human rights topics including discrimination, harassment, diversity, inclusion, bribery, and corruption. In 2023, 13% of the Borealis workforce<sup>31</sup> completed the human rights e-learning and 88% completed the ethics code of conduct e-learning. In addition, 100% of the Borealis Executive and Supervisory Boards received in-person ethics training covering human rights.\n\nSapuraOMV has continued raising awareness of human rights among its staff. To ensure everyone who works for SapuraOMV is kept up to date, all new staff, including\n\ninterns, are briefed during their induction and are required to complete an online e-learning module on human rights within the first month of their employment. In this module, they are taught the basics and the main principles of human rights, as well as the implications for their own work. A total of 326 employees have completed the onehour human rights e-learning since its launch in 2022.\n\nWe also implement internal awareness-raising campaigns throughout the Group. On the occasion of the UN World Day Against Trafficking in Persons on July 30, 2023, we informed our staff about our policies and activities against human trafficking. During an internal communication initiative, we also explained how everyone can contribute to this in their daily lives by paying attention to the wellbeing of our own and our contractors' and suppliers' workers, and being alert to any complaints or allegations regarding working conditions. A human rights awareness campaign was also conducted on the occasion of the international Human Rights Day in December. All employees Group-wide were informed about our commitment and the Human Rights Learning Path, and were invited to complete the human rights training modules.\n\nIn 2023, we also focused on developing the skills and awareness of our business partners in the context of human rights. Within the Libyan NOC onboarding exchange program, representatives from the NOC and the operating companies participated in a 1.5-hour human rights awareness session. In addition, we developed and implemented an exchange program to further strengthen the human rights skills of PARCO's CSR manager. During a two-week training program, she gained knowledge of corporate responsibilities and reporting concerning human rights and its integration and fulfillment in various corporate functions. The objective was to implement the findings in coordination with the implementation of the recommended actions resulting from the Human Rights Self-Assessment (HRSA) exercise at PARCO. She had individual training sessions with various OMV corporate functions that deal with human rights-related topics, including security, procurement, people and culture, community relations, and development. Additionally, she worked on an assignment to better understand the process behind the development of a human rights policy document for an organization.\n\nRegarding specific labor rights issues, the rights and obligations of our employees are set out in employment contracts. We keep our employees up to date via our various internal channels of communication (e.g., employee intranet, emails, and news feed) in the event of legal changes or new available information. For questions and specific information, we provide local P&C contacts and employee support hotlines.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Employee Representation**\n\nEmployee representation is a valued and long-standing feature in the Company's strategic orientation. Employee representatives are offered information and consultation rights as legally foreseen. A good and constructive working relationship with employee representation is an overall priority and is seen as being in the best interest of the Group and our staff.\n\nGiven the internationality of our Group activities and the various locations where we operate, employee representation at the OMV Group is diverse and depends on the local legal situation and the setup and activities of the local workforce. We cooperate with all official employee representation bodies, and deal responsibly with our staff directly where no employee representation is available.\n\n#### **Grievance Management**\n\nAccording to the UN Guiding Principles, an effective grievance mechanism is a crucial instrument for ensuring compliance with our human rights commitment, and a source of continuous learning for improving Company human rights performance. Particular emphasis is placed on the prevention of human rights violations and the integration of human rights issues into our decision-making processes. This includes registering grievances to ensure a preventive approach.\n\nOur approach to managing community grievances follows the precautionary principle of obtaining local approval of OMV Group operations. This involves identifying and resolving the issues of concern to the local community early on. OMV's localized Community Grievance Mechanism (CGM) procedures stipulate a stringent approach to systematically receiving, documenting, addressing, and resolving grievances in all the countries where we operate. Human rights grievances from community members and suppliers are submitted through the CGM and then analyzed locally and at Group level. For more information about the CGM, see Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\nWe offer our employees various channels for bringing issues, concerns, and grievances to our attention. They include the PetrOmbudsman at OMV Petrom, where employees and management can have confidential, offthe-record, informal discussions and address issues related to the workplace. Moreover, employees can bring forward their concerns in direct dialogue with human rights managers, human resources business partners, and works council members. At Borealis, such concerns can also be raised through the Borealis Ethics Hotline, anonymously and confidentially, with Group Ethics & Compliance, Ethics Ambassadors, and other reporting channels. In the event of legal or other changes (e.g., restructuring and pension issues), we offer interactive\n\ncommunication sessions with employees regarding working conditions. In 2023, internal grievances concerning field rotations and annual leave were raised by seven site employees. All seven cases are closed. At the end of 2023, out of twelve, two grievances had not yet been solved and P&C was still in dialogue with the complainants – in an effort to find a solution acceptable for all stakeholders involved and in line with national law and international human rights standards. The OMV Group's strong human rights management was put to the test in 2022 when we were faced with major human rights violations related to our business activities.\n\nThe OMV Group is always seeking ways to improve and is strongly committed to further strengthening its processes and mitigation measures to prevent any maltreatment and disrespect of workers' human rights in the supply chain.\n\nAt corporate level, we analyzed the HSSE and Procurement directives for contractor management and prepared a detailed checklist for human rights compliance to be used at site level. The human rights e-learning refers specifically to human rights in business relations, and the new OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement details our human rights commitment related to labor rights and business partners in line with business best practice and international standards. There was a dedicated instructor-led session within the Sustainability Academy on the Human Rights Learning Path, focused solely on human rights in contractor and supplier management – 25 participants from various functions at OMV Petrom, Borealis, and OMV learned about the most relevant human rights risks and how to identify and address them. Our Code of Conduct is currently under review. It defines our business partners' human rights responsibilities in more detail, including commitments on conducting human rights due diligence. We use our collaboration with business partners to embed salient human rights in their business practices and increase their awareness of ethical and ecological standards. We expect business partners to also pass these requirements, as applicable, on to their respective business partners, thus ensuring the application of the values and principles of our Code of Conduct, including ethical behavior, throughout our full value chain.\n\nAt local level, individual monitoring initiatives have been continued to ensure our business partners' compliance with human rights. Among these were spot checks and HSSE walks, the inclusion of human rights in service quality meetings and evaluation criteria with our contractors, the confirmation of contractor employees' employment registrations with local labor offices, detailed checks of framework contracts, and intensified promotion of our human rights training options. Furthermore, all business entities developed shortand mid-term plans to intensify human rights management in contractor relations.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a triangular roof and a rectangular body.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nSapuraOMV has followed up on its short- and long-term measures to improve our human rights performance in business relations, covering the topics of contractors'\n\nagreements and work permits, wages, working and break times, working and housing conditions, access to grievance mechanisms, and training.\n\n#### **Update on the Kallo Case**\n\nIn 2022, Borealis was confronted with reports of alleged human trafficking practices conducted by the main contractor IREM and their subcontractor on a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant construction site in Kallo, Belgium. The practices were reported to involve exploitation, inadequate compensation, lack of social security, and poor housing conditions. Belgian media subsequently alleged that Borealis had been informed two months earlier about these large-scale human trafficking practices. Borealis' internal checks have established that in May 2022 a Borealis employee was made aware for the first time of allegations of social malpractice in relation to one IREM worker through a private social media channel, and that this incident had been reported to the Social Inspectorate of Belgium. Since the allegation, Borealis has taken many steps to increase oversight of its Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) construction site in Kallo, Belgium, and advance its organizational set-up both in terms of competence and governance.\n\nBorealis invested in additional capabilities and capacities to reduce the risk of social misconduct and malpractices, such as setting up and implementing a Global Social Compliance Team, with one social compliance manager across the company and three regional social compliance managers. Borealis also implemented regular alignment meetings with the social inspectorate and work authorities in Belgium and Austria.\n\nBorealis also improved its ability to detect and address any misconduct. Awareness for social compliance was substantially increased n and it is now an integral part of the quarterly business review. A social compliance video in 14 languages and \"Speak up\" cards in 27 languages were produced to promote a speak-up culture within the organization, as well as for supplier onboarding with a focus on social compliance. In addition, Borealis has started to pursue to social compliance engagement walks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, and Sweden. In these engagement walks, the external workers are interviewed on social compliance matters while working on our sites. In case of alleged grievances or an increased risk profile, based on a risk evaluation, external audits will be conducted on social compliance matters and in case of concerns, mitigation plans are agreed and closely monitored. The Borealis Ethics Hotline was also opened to external whistleblowers and a process description implemented in the Borealis Management System (BMS), explaining in detail how to handle any such reports.\n\nBorealis has a zero-tolerance policy for social malpractices and misconduct. A management document was implemented in the BMS, stating the company's social compliance ambition, the framework for identifying regulatory and social compliance risks, advice on designing and implementing regulatory and legal compliance processes and controls to mitigate such risks, and how to monitor and report the effectiveness of these controls. Borealis has also implemented stricter access checks at the site gates of its production locations in Austria and Belgium, combined with more frequent and risk-based checks.\n\nBorealis wanted to provide support to workers who were negatively impacted by the Kallo case and has therefore been in contact with the organization mandated by the Belgian authorities to take care of victims of human trafficking in the Flanders region. In August 2022, immediately after the facts of the Kallo case emerged, Borealis offered a donation from the Borealis Social Fund to the organization to ensure that the victims could obtain all the support they needed. The discussions were conducted for several months, and in the end their offer was not accepted.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

It sets out OMV Petrom's understanding of and responsibility for human rights in our business environment. It is OMV Petrom's guiding principle for dealing with human rights issues in all aspects of daily business. It was published on [www.omvpetrom.com](https://www.omvpetrom.com/) and communicated to suppliers and dealers.\n\nThroughout the year, OMV Petrom conducted three \"crossdivision\" audits, which included human rights aspects, for some of its key contractors (i.e., those with contracts for at least two business divisions, whose activities are of high or medium HSSE risk, and who have long-term business activity with OMV Petrom). Topics like minimum age requirements, collective representation, training, and complaint systems were discussed and documentation provided.\n\nIn 2023, 13 human rights audits and assessments were conducted across the OMV Group. The findings of these, both positive and negative, are compiled in reports that are shared with the responsible managers. Our Group human rights experts support local management in developing action plans to address any identified issues or risks and further strengthen the integration of human rights into our business activities and relationships. In regular update meetings we monitor the activities and provide guidance and training to best overcome any challenges in implementing these action plans.\n\nBorealis signed off its Human Rights Policy Statement in October 2023 with formal approval by the CEO. A new Social Compliance team, consisting of a Borealis Social Compliance Manager and three regional Social Compliance Managers, has been recruited and has established and implemented new social compliance processes and procedures to ensure compliant business conduct by Borealis' business partners, particularly relating to the legal and ethical treatment of workers. Borealis has also conducted a human rights assessment at all Borealis locations in Belgium and the Netherlands. The assessment concludes that Borealis staff have a basic awareness of human rights requirements in accordance with applicable law and the Borealis Group's policies related to human rights. Implementation of the human rights e-learning beginning in the fall of 2023 will continue to help raise awareness on human rights in Borealis locations.\n\nIn Malaysia, SapuraOMV continued to close any outstanding issues from the 2022 assessment at Jerun Fabrication Yard, e.g., regarding wages and benefits, to ensure everyone who works for the Jerun Offshore Development project is paid above minimum wage, their PPE is provided, and they know how to access the grievance mechanism. An on-site human rights assessment was conducted at the Asia Supply Base (ASB) in Labuan, covering its own staff and those employed under contract. It focused especially on the areas of wages and benefits, child labor, forced labor, working hours, and break times. SapuraOMV also initiated Human Rights Self-Assessments in Jerun, ASB, and B15. The respective managers were briefed about the questionnaire and the process and completed all questionnaires over the subsequent weeks. The analysis and final report including recommendations are expected in 2024.\n\n#### Outlook\n\nThe OMV Group will take the following actions in the coming years to continue to improve our human rights approach:\n\n- Continue our efforts in 2024, with our ongoing training and an awareness-raising campaign for employees.\n- Finalize and roll out the reviewed Human Rights Management System across the Group and provide training to further enhance internal skills for its implementation and for the strengthened integration of human rights due diligence into existing business processes.\n- We intend to focus on on-site human rights checks, to improve monitoring while at the same time raising awareness of human rights among our own and contractors' staff.\n- We aim to carry out assessments of high-risk nonoperating assets to identify and address the human rights impacts of our business practices.\n- Borealis is seeking certification for Social Compliance Standard SA8000 and will further enhance its social compliance procedures, based on experience gained in 2023.\n\n<sup>32</sup> Thirty grievances in the context of alleged human trafficking practices by the (sub)contractor at the propane dehydrogenation plant construction site in Kallo, Belgium, are related to exploitation, inadequate compensation, lack of social security, and poor housing conditions of workers. However, at the current point in the investigations there is no evidence of forced labor practices as understood under the ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue circular icon with a white house symbol inside.

We will actively remove barriers to provide equitable opportunities for each employee to grow and contribute to the success of our companies. We will build a culture of trust and respect by working together to ensure an inclusive and safe space for everyone to be their whole and authentic self. The OMV Group is therefore expanding its DEI focus to include a broader range of diversity aspects, such as age, nationality, and diversity of ideas. Ultimately, our goal is to encourage and support all forms of diversity in the workforce and create an environment of respect where all employees are valued. This means having an inclusive culture in which the same opportunities and level of psychological safety are in place for all people to feel supported and be successful, regardless of their background (e.g., nationality, gender, age, social, and health).\n\n## Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nAs stated in our Code of Conduct, employees and job applicants will not be discriminated against because of their age, race, faith or religion, skin color, nationality, ethnic origin, political or other beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, or family status. We have also developed a Group-wide People & Culture Ethics Guideline, which gives more details on our clear position regarding non-discrimination in the workplace. In line with this guideline, we aim to provide Group-wide complaint procedures and investigation principles for any misconduct in this regard.\n\nThe principle of equal opportunity is strictly observed in recruitment. Furthermore, to encourage gender diversity, our recruitment policy reflects our commitment to promoting equal opportunities; at least one female candidate is included in the shortlist for each position, where possible. Gender is one of the diversity criteria we use when selecting members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. We encourage equal pay at all career stages, for example by setting standardized entry-level salaries that are reviewed each year in line with the local market situation.\n\n### Governance\n\nResponsibility for the diversity topic is anchored at the highest level, as the achievement of diversity targets forms part of the ESG targets in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) in the Executive Board's remuneration.\n\nThe OMV Group's People & Culture (P&C) department is responsible for implementing the Group's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy. For more information on P&C, see Employees.\n\nA governance team comprising People & Culture, Communications, and sponsors from Board level across the OMV Group was formed in 2022 to work on our DEI strategy and reach the milestones defined in our roadmap. In addition, during DEI workshops, a volunteer team comprising OMV Group employees was formed and onboarded to provide support in achieving our DEI goals. The volunteer team supports our actions by promoting the initiatives within their teams, creating the voice of the DEI community, and increasing visibility.\n\n## Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\nWe have embedded diversity targets into our people processes such as recruitment, talent and succession planning, learning, and leadership development to ensure female talent is identified and women are supported throughout their career. To strengthen our pipeline of diverse leaders, we have introduced the following measures:\n\n- Providing advanced mentoring for women\n- Launching the SHEnergy women's leadership development program\n- Running career aspiration talks across all our divisions in the OMV Group with the goal of giving talented female employees greater visibility and ensuring we better understand their support needs and individual career plans\n- Encouraging leaders to create an inclusive working environment by making it part of our leadership competencies and performance evaluation of leaders\n- Covering unconscious bias in our leadership programs (in its broadest sense, so not only gender but also generational, people with special needs, background, etc.)\n- Offering interview training as part of our new manager training with the goal of teaching behavioral interviewing techniques, such as how to overcome unconscious bias and how to better structure interviews\n- Including internationality in the criteria for assessing candidates when recruiting executives\n\nThe growing diversity of employees (e.g., gender, generations, and internationality) in leadership positions at OMV confirms the effectiveness of the dialogue and activities underway.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

Building on the foundation laid in 2022 with the launch of the Group-wide DEI strategy for 2030, the OMV Group took significant steps to further embed these principles in its corporate culture. The following initiatives were carried out in 2023:\n\n- The OMV Group further strengthened its DEI strategy by establishing a governance framework. The structure includes five volunteer-based workstreams, led by employees across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis. These dedicated workstreams focus on gender, generations, parenting/caregiving, people with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ inclusion, thus ensuring holistic representation. Each of these workstreams has clear targets and their progress is reported to the sponsors (EB members) twice a year. The workstreams are supervised by the People & Culture management and are sponsored by Executive Board (EB) members of OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis.\n- The International Women's Week featured two impactful events under the theme #EmbraceEquity, highlighting the distinction between equality and equity. The week started with a keynote speech by an external guest speaker, delving into the concepts of self-value and its contribution to the company's success. Additionally, a virtual gathering with three EB members was organized, fostering dialogue on Embracing Equity in the Workplace and promoting a fair and inclusive work environment.\n- The new parent program that was launched in 2021 continued to provide essential support to expecting parents within the OMV Group. By offering workshops covering various aspects of parenthood, including parental leave planning and returning to work, this program helped both male and female expecting parents navigate this period with confidence. Moreover, the OMV Group was awarded the \"Family-Friendly Employer\" award, which was presented by the Minister for Women, Integration, Family, and Media, Susanne Raab. This acknowledgment reaffirmed the organization's dedication to promoting work-life balance and accommodating the needs of working parents.\n- We developed a roadmap for people with disabilities. The OMV Group was audited by myAbility, an initiative aimed at evaluating and enhancing workplace accessibility and inclusivity. The audit results were used to create a detailed roadmap for the company. In November, teenagers were welcomed from a special needs school, facilitating a valuable exchange that provided insights into the corporate world while promoting inclusivity. For example, the organization's commitment was further illustrated on December 4, when the OMV Group participated in the International Day of Persons with Disability, hosting a symbolic Purple Light Up event. The panel discussion with external guest speakers focused on the unique perspectives and insights of the world of disability inclusion, shedding light on the possibilities that arise when we embrace diversity in all its forms and what we can do to show our support. Our colleagues from OMV Petrom created a disability brochure that provides a comprehensive introduction to the disability topic that increases the awareness of all our employees. In addition, the Works Council has created a community for colleagues with disabilities and carers of people with a disability to provide practical support and information about benefits and funding options. In doing so, we are fostering awareness, reducing mental barriers toward people with disabilities, and increasing accessibility.\n- With regard to LGBTQI+, the OMV Group promoted allyship and solidarity within the organization during the Ally Week in September. A panel discussion opened by the OMV Group's CFO encouraged open dialogue and understanding among employees, reinforcing the OMV Group's commitment to inclusivity. Community lunches also occurred several times during the year, where members of the community and allies could meet.\n- To enhance communication and knowledge-sharing related to DEI initiatives, the OMV Group created a dedicated DEI SharePoint site. The platform serves as a central hub for employees to access resources, stay informed about ongoing initiatives, and actively participate in fostering an inclusive workplace.\n\n### Outlook\n\nSeveral initiatives that will help achieve the goals set in our People & Culture Strategy 2030 have been planned for 2024. These include:\n\n- Regular reporting on age distribution to identify gaps and foster intergenerational collaboration\n- Implementing DEI in our Transformational Leadership program\n- Fostering the development of female talent with specific development programs such as SHEnergy, organizing career aspiration talks with board members, and celebrating International Women's Day with impactful events\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

In 2024, we will again assess our gender pay gap across the OMV Group.\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/24 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white outline of three people inside.

It displays the number '8' in white above the words 'DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH,' also in white, against a dark red background. Below the text is a white icon depicting a line graph with an upward trend, indicating economic growth.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the OMV Group's Strategy 2030, all Human Resources (HR) functions Group-wide were renamed People & Culture (P&C). The aim of this department is to fully support the OMV Group's Strategy 2030 by prioritizing key aspects that enable us to unlock our organization's full potential. The new name points to the department's aim and purpose and emphasizes that people and culture are central to achieving the targets defined in our strategy.\n\nWe developed a new People & Culture Strategy in 2022, which fully supports the transformation of OMV and is focused around \"People make it happen\". The core of the new People & Culture Strategy is our purpose, i.e., \"Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living.\" We have developed four strategic drivers: Employee Experience, Growing Talent, Organizational Evolution, and New Ways of Working. These are all powered by a solid foundation of Transformational Leadership, driven by our leaders. As such, the statement \"People make it happen\" not only creates the right working environment in which our employees can thrive, but also ensures that they can further develop their skill sets to meet the demands of our dynamic business. The various initiatives connected to the People & Culture Strategy, like the launch of our new OMV Group Values, created a big impact.\n\nBuilding and retaining a talented and skilled team of employees for international and integrated growth is a key factor in the success of the Group's strategy. We are committed to creating an environment in which every employee can learn, grow, connect, and collaborate, as well as live a safe and healthy life. OMV's core commitments to its employees are detailed in the Code of Conduct. These include promoting learning and development and creating an environment where people can develop professionally and\n\nfulfil their personal aspirations in line with our business needs.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe OMV Group's P&C department covers the following topics:\n\n- Talent acquisition\n- People development, including strategic competency development, talent and learning management\n- People relations, comprising payroll and employee administration and employment law and contracts\n- Rewards and global mobility\n- Coordination by People & Culture representatives of the activities of various units and countries in which we operate\n\nThe organizational setup of the local P&C departments in the various countries is aligned with the principles of being fit for purpose, operating as efficiently as possible, and generating the broadest possible synergies. We promote the strategic exchange of talent between OMV and Borealis to offer employees additional job opportunities and support the development of new skill sets.\n\nThe OMV Group P&C leadership team reports directly to the OMV Group Senior Vice President (SVP) of P&C. The VPs of the P&C departments at Borealis and OMV Petrom functionally report to the SVP of P&C of the OMV Group. The SVP reports directly to the CEO.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Effective succession planning contributes to the management of business continuity risk by ensuring the preservation of human capital – OMV's most valued asset. As described in our Code of Conduct, OMV strives to build long-lasting employment relationships and to employ people from the countries where we operate.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Talent Acquisition**\n\nOur employees are selected exclusively based on their qualifications, suitability, and professional experience. Internally, we focus on job rotation, promotions, and upskilling to tackle challenges (e.g., transitioning to a lowcarbon business) and develop innovative solutions to enhance our workforce. In the OMV Group, we use joint internal job boards to offer a wide range of internal job opportunities to our employees.\n\nExternally, we concentrate on building robust talent pipelines through cooperation with key universities in our locations. In addition, we aim to build a talent pool by providing apprenticeship programs and internships, which are mainly focused on the technical and commercial aspects of our business. For instance, in Romania, approximately 100 students received scholarships to join the Petrochemical School program in 2023. The Petrochemical School is a dual-system program supported by OMV Petrom. The future petrochemists benefit from professional training in the field of petrochemicals and internships at the Petrobrazi refinery. The students receive monthly scholarships of up to RON 700 from OMV Petrom, plus RON 200 from the Romanian government. Upon completion of the three years of vocational education (petrochemical operators' qualification), students will acquire a recognized professional qualification and will have employment opportunities within our Company. The Petrochemical School program is a pilot project with the aim of assuring a constant and sustainable flow of high-quality blue-collar workers.\n\nTo dispel the negative perceptions of the oil, gas, and plastics industries, it is important to proactively inform the public and our target groups (such as current and potential future employees) about the benefits of the products we produce, as well as the sustainability challenges and how we are addressing them. Being visible on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn enables us to show potential candidates the inner workings of the OMV Group, including what it is like to work for our Company and that joining us means being part of a solution for a more sustainable future.\n\n#### **Performance Management and Career Development**\n\nOMV strives to maintain a uniform organizational structure that provides clarity and transparency in relation to responsibilities and the hierarchical classification of positions. We have developed Company-wide career paths that outline the experience and skills required for a position.\n\nOMV has an annual review process in place to support our employees and managers through structured, systematic planning of performance and personal development within the Company. Employees and their managers work together to set performance and development goals, review progress, and evaluate achievements, with employees ultimately being rewarded and recognized annually.\n\n\"Personal Impact x Potential\" is used as an evaluation tool to provide structured feedback in performance reviews and in succession planning. Managers evaluate their employees on personal impact and potential and identify successors for business-critical positions. Based on this, an employee's development plan is created so they can improve the skills needed for their future role.\n\n#### **Rewards**\n\nTo promote and support OMV's strategy optimally, OMV aims to ensure competitive compensation and benefits packages within relevant labor markets in the oil, gas, and chemical industry. Annual remuneration reviews are conducted for this purpose.\n\nOMV continuously monitors market trends and international best practices in order to attract, motivate, and retain the best-qualified talent from around the world. Base salaries are set in accordance with internationally accepted methods for determining market levels of remuneration, and comply with the relevant legal regulations, for example collective agreements. Base salaries are market oriented, fair, and tailored to the position and expertise of the employee. OMV encourages equal pay at all career stages, for instance by setting standardized entry-level salaries that are reviewed each year in line with the local market situation.\n\nOMV strives for long-lasting employment relationships. We ensure the fair and objective evaluation of positions consistently across all divisions and countries by applying a clearly defined methodology and process, validated by external consultants for specific roles. The outcome of the evaluation forms the basis of the remuneration decisions for every employee. The remuneration includes a balanced and transparent mix of fixed and variable monetary and non-monetary components.\n\nAs part of the annual performance review process, Company goals, including the achievement of sustainability goals (e.g.,\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nHSSE, GHG emission reductions, diversity), are cascaded down to employees in the relevant departments and form part of the annual evaluation and subsequent bonus awarded. Individual monetary and non-monetary rewards are granted on top of this for extraordinary achievements.\n\nThe portfolio of benefits is further customized for each of the countries in which OMV operates to meet the needs of the local employees. Depending on local circumstances, additional incentives may include the following: retirement plans, subsidized cafeteria, health centers, kindergartens (childcare facilities), summer kids camp, and anniversary payments.\n\n#### **Leadership Development**\n\nTo ensure the transformation of OMV will be a success, we need to adapt our current methods to fit our new aspirations. By building on our capability, we are reinventing how we lead as well as our way of working. Therefore, linked to our Purpose and Values, we implemented Groupwide Transformational Leadership Competencies (TLCs). Our TLCs define our expectations of our leaders and complete our transformational framework to successfully drive the implementation of our strategy. The four TLCs for all leaders across the Group are \"Lead self,\" \"Grow people,\" \"Drive change,\" and \"Deliver impact.\"\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/7 description: The image shows a graphic with five sections, each representing a different concept. The first section, in blue, features the words \"Lead self\" above a stylized tree. The second section, in red, displays the words \"Grow people\" above a graphic of two hands shaking in the shape of a heart. The third section, in yellow, shows the words \"Drive change\" above a stylized wind turbine. The fourth section, in green, features the words \"Deliver impact\" above a stylized arrow pointing upwards. A continuous line connects all five sections, transitioning in color from blue to red to yellow to green.\n\nThe new TLCs are being integrated into the respective P&C processes, such as leadership assessment and development, our talent programs, talent acquisition, and performance processes.\n\n#### **Talent Retention**\n\nTo keep and retain talent, we have leadership programs in place that are designed to support all employees who take on new management roles as well as current leaders who want to upgrade their basic knowledge of leadership. The OMV Group Leading Ahead program launched last year together with Borealis and OMV Petrom to offer the Group's top talent a broad leadership development journey and a broad career platform. In 2023, the first participants graduated, and nominations continue for the next program runs.\n\nAs part of our ongoing transformation, are committed to ensure that no one is left behind. To facilitate this, we offer low-carbon training solutions and are continuing to expand our efforts to upskill our workforce. The aim is to keep skills up to date, recognizing that existing skills can be transferred to new energy solutions. We also launched the Sustainability Academy, a SharePoint-based platform for all employees, to expand their knowledge on ESG topics. Through initiatives like these, we are fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, empowering our team to thrive in the evolving landscape of sustainable energy solutions.\n\n#### **Employee Engagement**\n\nWe actively involve our employees in our transformation and in key P&C initiatives such as Diversity, Equity, and\n\nInclusion actions, developing our Values and implementing our 2030 Strategy (see actions 2023).\n\nThe Pulse Check is one of our most important tools for measuring the engagement of our employees and it is an essential part of our new People & Culture Strategy relating to Employee Experience. It is also a chance for our employees to have their say and an opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas. The Pulse Check assesses several key indices, including Safety, Innovation, Line Manager, Employee Development, Strategy, Empowerment/Involvement, Well-being, Values, Sustainability, and Culture.\n\nIn 2023, for the first time, we incorporated a question related to Sustainability into the Pulse Check. The statement \"I believe that our organization is committed to sustainability (e.g., reducing its carbon footprint, promoting diversity, protecting human rights)\" received a 70% positive perception rate. Each line manager is tasked with sharing the results and engaging in dialogue with their team and collaboratively identifying actions aimed at enhancing the current work environment to foster a stronger, more united team.\n\nIn the Pulse Check 2023, we achieved a very high response rate of 82% at Group level. Compared to 2022, 5% of employees in the OMV Group (OMV 7%) moved from actively disengaged/passive to moderately/highly engaged, meaning a 5% increase in the overall engagement score for the OMV Group. This positive trend can be seen across both gender groups. Since 2022, key indices have consistently improved in all dimensions, demonstrating the visible positive impact in our focus areas. As we maintain this momentum, our aim is to close gaps to global and industryrelevant benchmarks. Looking ahead to 2024, factoring in the\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nimportance, effectiveness, and likelihood of positive changes in each dimension, focus should be placed on improving employee development, strategy, and innovation indices.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nCEO-to-median-employee pay ratio: **78:1**<sup>42</sup>\n\n**13,868** performance reviews<sup>43</sup>\n\n**70** OMV senior leaders at Board, executive, and advanced levels provided mentoring services to **79** emerging, rising, and top talents across OMV and to **56** first-time leaders\n\n**919** employees participated in one of our Groupwide leadership programs.\n\nIn September 2022, our shared P&C Strategy was launched across the Group at OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis. The core of the new P&C Strategy is our purpose: \"Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living.\" Four strategic drivers were developed for this strategy: Employee Experience, Growing Talent, Organizational Evolution, and New Ways of Working, supported by Transformational Leadership. Some of the initiatives to support these strategic drivers in 2023 included:\n\n- In May 2023, we launched our new OMV Group Values \"We care | We're curious | We progress.\" Our Values were defined based on the contributions of more than 13,000 employees and leaders from across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis during a series of interactions, including the Pulse Check survey, leadership interviews, mass focus groups, and workshops, where a feedback tool based on artificial intelligence was used.\n- Ahead of the launch of our new Values, more than 120 leaders from across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis came together to embark on a shared Leadership Experimentation Journey of discovery, to experiment with our new Values, and experience first-hand the power they can have to transform our way of working and overcome daily business challenges. The result was the creation of individual Values Experiments, which leaders could implement in their teams to resolve their challenges. While the Values Experiments were underway, leaders from all three entities, departments, and functions convened in virtual mixed cohorts, discussing their progress, refining their experiments, and sharing their insights and successes across the OMV Group. This collaborative approach allowed leaders to leverage the company's values to overcome challenges and foster growth.\n- In addition to the Leadership Experimentation Journey, each leader was encouraged to organize a town hall meeting on our Values or, depending on the country, prepare a launch in their location accompanied by a team reflection session. During these sessions, leaders shared their personal stories, gathered initial feedback on the company's Values from their team, and engaged in thoughtful discussions about which behavior to strengthen or weaken. These initiatives were designed to bring the Values to life and foster a meaningful dialogue among teams.\n- We implemented a Purpose & Values Playbook as a guiding resource for leaders on their journey to give meaning and significance to the company's purpose and new Values. Moreover, we introduced a Values Activation Toolkit that offers diverse resources for leaders and their teams to continue the dialogue on the Values. This toolkit is designed to help seamlessly integrate our Values into their day-to-day business activities, promoting a meaningful connection and enabling them to create impact.\n- We also launched a Values SharePoint page accessible to all OMV Group employees, providing a platform to explore and share their personal Values Stories. Employees can also create their own Values Posters to visually express what the Values mean to them, fostering a collective understanding and appreciation of our shared Values.\n- In September 2023, we ran our annual Group-wide Pulse Check survey for the second time. Achieving an impressive 82% participation rate, a 12% increase from 2022, reflects the trust our employees place in our leaders to enact and deliver meaningful change. The results showed an increase in all dimensions with visible positive impact in key focus areas, including 69% on the understanding of our new Values. Conclusions and subsequent actions were agreed within business units by year-end and Q1 in 2024 for implementation in 2024.\n- We have introduced a Change Management Toolkit to provide our teams with overall change management guidance and supporting interventions as they navigate various change processes. This toolkit equips our teams with the necessary resources and strategies to effectively navigate and lead organizational transformations, ensuring a smooth and successful transition for our employees and stakeholders.\n- In response to the reorganization that was implemented in January 2023, Team Effectiveness Training has become a critical component. This training is designed to equip teams with the necessary skills and tools to navigate and thrive in the evolving structure, ensuring a seamless transition and fostering a more cohesive and effective working environment.\n\n<sup>42</sup> Excluding DUNATÁR Kft., OMV International Oil & Gas GmbH, and SapuraOMV Upstream\n\nData excluding blue-collar workers at OMV Petrom.

The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- Based on the Pulse Check results from 2022, a key focus was on enhancing transparency, accessibility, and collaboration within our organization. By promoting an environment of open communication and teamwork, we strive to break down silos and ensure that information flows freely. In order to achieve that, all leaders were asked to conduct Strategy Refresh Sessions within their teams to further explain the OMV Strategy 2030 and encourage dialogue.\n- Our commitment to learning and development continued, as we were able to expand our learning opportunities through initiatives such as LCB training and the Sustainability Academy. Read more about this in the Skills Development and Training chapter.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn line with our new People & Culture Strategy the coming years will see us focus on:\n\n- In 2024, we plan to introduce our new Employer Value Proposition (EVP). This will serve as a statement or framework that outlines what OMV stands for as an employer. It will highlight the unique qualities and benefits that we offer to our employees. Moreover, it will help us attract and engage potential candidates who align with our new purpose and our OMV Group Values, and the opportunities we provide. Essentially, it's a way for us to communicate why our company is a great place to work and why people should consider joining our team.\n- Following the rollout of our leadership competencies in 2023, a transformation leadership program will be offered, reflecting our new Values and enabling leaders to develop their leadership style. For more information please also see the Skills Development and Training section.\n- For all of our employees, we will be assessing what information and skills they need to support the transformation. Together with our network of experts, we plan to develop an interactive Campus that will support our employees in learning more about our purpose, strategy, and values and provide development sessions to help upskill them for the future.\n- To further support our employees in their development, we are starting to develop a competence framework based on Job Families with corresponding core competencies. This will help employees navigate their career and build their competencies through the dif-\n\n### Skills Development and Training\n\nProviding a culture where our employees can learn and continuously improve their knowledge, competencies, and performance to meet our business objectives and to develop necessary skills for the future is extremely important to the OMV Group.\n\nAs part of our P&C Strategy and our ongoing transformation, developing our employees has become top priority. We need to find and integrate employees with a wider range of skills. We need to balance the reskilling of employees to develop new energy solutions with retaining and training employees with the skills necessary to support our legacy business.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Needs Assessment**\n\nTraining is planned and delivered annually in line with our workforce requirements. It is planned by the business units according to business needs.\n\nIn 2023, we assessed specific learning needs. One aim of this was to increase knowledge of our Low Carbon Business in the Energy segment and strengthen the associated skills. We also wanted to expand know-how in our assets relating to operational management and refine awareness of our Sustainability Strategy among employees (see more below).\n\nEach employee identifies their learning needs through a combination of localized training matrices. These assist them in creating development-oriented action plans linked to career paths, competencies, and professional goals. The four key competencies we encourage our employees to further develop are functional and technical skills, business skills related to effective work at the OMV Group, personal skills, and leadership skills.\n\nAll learning activities should be linked to clearly defined learning and development objectives and agreed with line managers. There are different ways to learn: 70% of what we learn is through on-the-job tasks, 20% involves learning from others through coaching or mentoring, and 10% is from courses. Courses are developed and offered whenever a structured foundation for skills and knowledge is needed.\n\n#### **Reskilling and Upskilling Employees**\n\nTo develop our employees' skill sets to meet the demands of our dynamic business and to pave the path to become a net-zero company by 2050, we are focusing on the following key areas:\n\nferent Job Families. Upskilling our leaders on the newly implemented Transformational Leadership Competencies to enable them to drive the implementation of our strategy.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/1 description: The image contains text describing the OMV Group's efforts to boost employee knowledge and skills in sustainability. It mentions that the OMV Group offers a wide selection of online material and regularly adds Learning Journeys to prepare employees for the evolution of their business.\n\n- Specific initiatives to upskill employees in technical areas are being continued, e.g., focusing on transitioning to a low-carbon business.\n- Initiatives to develop managers in our assets of our legacy business to drive operational excellence.\n- With several initiatives in the area of data science (e.g., data camp) and digital development we provide our employees with the opportunity develop practical skills and excel in the rapidly growing field of digitalization.\n\n#### **Types of Training**\n\nOMV provides mandatory training for all employees in areas such as business ethics, cybersecurity, and data protection, as well as mandatory training depending on the job, for instance within HSSE. In addition, we offer a wide range of optional training for all employees, ranging from technical training (e.g., low-carbon initiatives and sales training) to personal skills training such as managing change or effective communication.\n\nWe encourage the use of online resources for training. The expansion of our online learning content enables employees to access more consistent training content and enhances its accessibility for our offices globally. We also highly encourage employees to pursue further education to enhance their various skills.\n\n#### **Evaluation of Training Programs**\n\nTraining processes include structured requests for feedback, which are conducted after training events in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and success of training measures, and to implement improvement measures. In addition, our overall training metrics (participation, costs, training hours, training topics, etc.) are reported in a training dashboard at a global level every quarter.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**20,549** training participants **EUR 12.3 mn** mn spent on training More than **590,000** hours of training in total\n\n- In 2023, there was a focus on mandatory, legally binding, and business-critical courses for selflearning. Several Group-wide e-learning modules were launched, covering topics such as business ethics, human rights, and data and information security. With the rollout of the HSSE Basics e-learning, Life-Saving Rules e-learning, and g-learning for all employees, the HSSE offer was also expanded.\n- In 2023, we updated our leadership programs with our new Values and Transformational Leadership Competencies that were designed to support both those employees who take on new management roles as well as current leaders who want to upgrade their basic knowledge of leadership. For identified talents at executive level, our dedicated Leading Ahead top talent program focusing on enhancing executive leadership skills was continued, as was our program for women in leadership positions.\n- In terms of graduate development, we offered the second tailored graduate program in Fuels & Feedstock and continued with our long-standing Integrated Graduate Development (IGD) Program in the Energy segment.\n- To support the development of future skills, we rolled out a global data science education platform. Its intuitive and user-friendly interface ensures that learners can develop practical skills and excel in the fastgrowing field of data science.\n- The Sustainability Academy was launched and offered our employees an ever-growing selection of curated learning material about sustainability-related topics. This supports our employees in expanding their knowledge on ESG topics and provides them with a foundation that is needed to understand their role in our journey to net zero. Focus topics for 2023 were ESG, Climate Change, Circular Economy, Sustainable Products, and Human Rights.\n- To support the upskilling of technical employees, we offered specific training initiatives, for example training on low-carbon energy, geothermal, decision quality, and data science.\n- With our Personal Skills Summer Challenge, we playfully encouraged our employees to continue developing their personal skills. At team level, we had a strong increase in team effectiveness training, which supported leaders and their teams in managing the transformation phase.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nVarious ongoing projects started in 2023 will be ready for launch in the course of 2024. This will positively impact the overall user journey for learners, not only by expanding the content of the learning offer (rollout of specific learning\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The Sustainability Academy will continue to grow in 2024 with additional Learning Paths and focus topics.\n- To help our leaders develop their leadership style so they can inspire, support, and empower others to thrive through continuous change and deliver our strategy, we will be launching the Transformational Leadership Program. Over the next three years, we want to equip our leaders with the necessary mindset, knowledge, and skills to lead with purpose and transform our company.\n- To enable our employees to support the transformation, we plan to develop an interactive Campus. We will offer an engaging collection of learning material including e-learning modules, keynote lectures, microlearning, and other learning offers that leverage the expertise and knowledge of our network of experts.\n\nThrough initiatives like these, we are fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, empowering our teams to thrive in the evolving landscape of sustainable energy solutions.\n\n| Target 2030        | Increase average number of annual learning hours to at least 30 hours per employee |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Status 2023        | Average number of annual learning hours: 30                                        |\n| Most relevant SDGs | Image: SDG 4    Image: SDG 8                                                       |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**4.4** By 2030, substantially increase the number of young people and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship\n\n**8.2** Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation, including through a focus on high value added and labor-intensive sectors\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon, on the right, is blue and features the number 16 at the top left, followed by the words \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS.\" Below the text is a white graphic of a dove holding an olive branch above a gavel.\n\nFor OMV, transparency, trust, and partnership-based relationships with local communities are key to ensuring we are a responsible and welcomed neighbor wherever we operate. Adding value to the communities where we operate is essential for safeguarding our operations for the future. In the interest of being a responsible international company, we contribute positively to the fulfillment of human rights in our immediate surroundings through a number of projects and initiatives. Investments in community relations and development respond specifically to identified community needs. They are designed to mitigate social risks that could result from company operations and initiate positive change in neighboring communities.\n\nOur commitments to our communities are laid out in our Human Rights Policy Statement. Our Sustainability Directive documents processes and accountability internally, and covers social responsibility, which comprises community relations, development and social investments, human rights, volunteering, and NGO relations for the OMV Group. A special Community Relations and Development handbook is available for all of the OMV Group's community relations managers.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Community Relations and Development function within Group Sustainability governs and steers community relations at Group level and implements development activities in the countries in which we operate. It also receives regular reporting and feedback from social responsibility teams and local teams, and monitors and ensures adherence to the Group's guidelines on community relations and development. We hold regular structured alignment meetings with our local community relations managers to monitor and steer local implementation of our site-specific global community relations and development commitments. We also organize regular exchanges between all countries in order to share challenges and best-practice experiences as a supplement to the guidance provided. According to our Sustainability Directive, each business area and all subsidiaries can act as initiators of community development investments and social investments within the framework of the OMV Group's Sustainability Strategy processes.\n\nSteering ensures that the OMV Executive Board is informed in an adequate and timely manner about the entire community and social investments portfolio, plans, and performance KPIs. For example, the Group's community relations managers submitted the total budget for community and social investments in 2023 and provided information on the major social or community investments planned.\n\n#### **Borealis Social Fund**\n\nIn 2008, Borealis launched the Borealis Social Fund. Each year, a portion of Borealis net profit is donated to the Fund, based on clearly defined allocation rules. Any external or internal stakeholder can submit a project proposal to the Borealis Sustainability Team, which then validates the proposal and makes recommendations to the CEO, who has responsibility for the Fund and selects and approves all projects. Sponsorship above EUR 0.5 mn per project per year also needs the approval of the Chairman or Deputy Chairperson of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **OMV Petrom Foundation**\n\nLaunched in 2022, the OMV Petrom Foundation develops programs that support long-term investments in disadvantaged communities in Romania in three key areas: health, education, and environment. The Foundation provides resources and solutions and builds strategic longterm partnerships with other non-governmental organizations and central or local public authorities, with the aim of reducing infant mortality, supporting early education, and promoting biodiversity. Through the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom extends its support to early health and education and environmental initiatives that are highlighted in the Social Investment chapter.\n\n#### Community Impacts and Grievances\n\nWe acknowledge that the presence of OMV's business has direct and indirect impacts on local communities. We aim to steer the impacts of our business activities in a positive direction by building and maintaining mutual trust and pursuing respectful community relations, investing in local development, safeguarding human rights, and ensuring that the local suppliers who work with OMV follow sustainable practices. Transparent and prompt communication with local communities that ensures their voices and concerns are heard and addressed helps OMV establish good relations with those impacted by our business operations and supports us in creating a conducive operating environment for the business.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Community Consultation and Social Impact Assessments**\n\nOur community relations and development management process is based on centralized policies and targets, and is implemented by locally responsible persons using local resources. In line with our community relations and development procedure, which is in effect for all countries in which we are active, we engage with local communities through tailored programs. For instance, all projects from OMV's Energy segment require community consultation in the development phase. In 2023, 5 out of 13 development projects were in the process of community consultation.\n\nWe start by conducting a Social Impact Assessment (SIA), which includes the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of local stakeholders. Sometimes, an SIA is integrated into an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to foster synergies and efficiencies. The purpose of an SIA is to ensure that the views of the local communities, especially of indigenous peoples, are incorporated into and addressed throughout all phases of the project life cycle: commissioning, operation, and decommissioning or abandonment. We also pay particular attention to any possible impact on human rights.\n\nBased on the internal guidelines for conducting SIAs, we include a baseline study, community needs assessments, stakeholder analyses, and a study of social risks associated with the project. Where possible, SIAs are conducted in a participatory manner by directly consulting with potentially affected communities. Our standards require the outcomes of the SIA to be communicated to affected stakeholders. Based on the outcome of the SIA, site-specific strategies for community relations and development, stakeholder engagement plans, and Community Grievance Mechanisms are developed and implemented.\n\n#### **Community Engagement**\n\nWe maintain regular communication with the communities that live where we operate and strive to inform them in advance of any planned business activities that may affect them. For example, in the vicinity of our refineries, stakeholders such as local authorities and neighbors are proactively informed in advance of any work that may cause a disturbance (e.g., noise from turnarounds) by way of stakeholder meetings, social media, leaflets, and other channels as appropriate. An example of this in action is the \"green phone\" at the Schwechat refinery, which has ensured 24/7 direct contact for all neighbors for several years now. Every call is answered by the shift supervisor in charge, and in cases of perceived noises or odors, the shift supervisor checks immediately for potential sources in the refinery so that the issue can be resolved as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen plants are decommissioned or we exit a location, our community relations team ensures that potential social impacts are addressed by drawing up targeted community engagement plans, social impact assessment and management plans, and exit strategies for ongoing community development projects.\n\n#### **Community Grievance Mechanisms**\n\nOur approach to managing community grievances follows the precautionary principle of obtaining local approval of OMV operations. This involves identifying and resolving the issues of concern to the local community early on. We strive to conduct our operations in a way that reduces any disruption to our neighboring communities to a minimum; however, grievances can still arise. We manage these grievances through localized Community Grievance Mechanisms (CGMs). The CGMs help OMV and those potentially impacted by its operations resolve issues in a non-judicial manner and, depending on the case, offer access to a solution.\n\nThe CGMs are fully operational in all operated E&P assets, in all three OMV refineries (Schwechat in Austria, Burghausen in Germany, and Petrobrazi in Romania), and at one power plant (Brazi in Romania). A Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM) is in place at SapuraOMV.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nhas a hotline system where grievances can be reported by both internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAt OMV, a CGM is a key tool for preventing and managing our potential impacts on local communities and any associated social risks. Our management of community grievances aims to be fully aligned with the Ipieca best practice guidelines and with the Effectiveness Criteria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Effectiveness Criteria require a grievance mechanism to be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, a source of continuous learning, and based on engagement and dialogue. OMV has set a target to assess the CGMs at all sites against the UN Effectiveness Criteria for Non-Judicial Grievance Mechanisms by 2025. The CGM assessments review the existing processes and practices in place, and identify practical improvement measures. During these assessments, internal and external stakeholders are consulted, including via interviews, on the current performance of CGMs and design improvements that may be necessary. The main findings (e.g., key strengths, improvement areas, and proposed actions) are included in the CGM Assessment Report. The action plans are implemented by local management and monitored by the Group Community Relations and Development function.\n\nCGM assessments have so far been completed in OMV's Energy segment in Austria, Romania, Tunisia, New Zealand, and Malaysia, as well as at the Schwechat, Burghausen and the Petrobrazi refineries. Follow-up actions are currently being implemented in accordance with the findings. The sites already assessed account for 93% of all registered grievances at OMV in 2023.\n\nThe CGMs stipulate a stringent approach to systematically receiving, investigating, documenting, addressing, and resolving grievances in all the countries where we operate in a timely, fair, and consistent manner, thereby laying the foundation for our social license to operate. We define a grievance as an expression of dissatisfaction stemming from a real or perceived impact of the Company's business activities. Grievances can be communicated verbally or in writing and can also be expressed in local languages. They can be lodged by email, phone, through our community relations staff working locally and other locally dedicated channels, as well as at a corporate level. The grievances can be expressed anonymously, as well as on behalf of another individual. OMV does not seek retaliation against any community members who lodge a grievance.\n\nOur grievance management system is based on dialogue with our stakeholders first and foremost and is designed to prevent any risk of retaliation. The CGMs help OMV and those potentially impacted by its operations resolve issues without resorting to the legal system. However, OMV's CGMs do not hinder or prevent affected stakeholders, including\n\nlocal communities, from accessing judicial solutions or other remedies for their complaints or grievances. What they do offer is a channel for resolving grievances out of court and, depending on the case, a remedy for community members. For more information on our community grievance mechanism process, see the [OMV website](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/our-approach/ethical-principles/community-grievance-mechanism-process).\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**732** total external grievances in 2023:\n\n**475** grievances related to our impact on society<sup>44</sup> received (413 resolved45)\n\n**238** grievances concerning an impact on the environment<sup>46</sup> received (178 resolved)\n\n**19** human rights grievances<sup>47</sup> received from externals (19 resolved)\n\nIn 2023, the following key improvements were made to our community relations approach:\n\n- OMV Tunisia completed its CGM Assessment against the UN Effectiveness Criteria. The assessment was conducted to evaluate how OMV Tunisia is implementing the CGM. It highlighted strengths, identified issues and risks, and spotted areas for improvement. Among the key strengths identified was the fact that the mechanism is fully functioning in a highly complex environment and consistently being used to receive and resolve grievances, including legacy grievances, and there is continuous engagement and dialogue with claimants. Recommendations to improve the CGM, such as further improving accessibility, transparency, and documentation, were determined and an action plan was developed and is currently being implemented.\n- The majority of grievances received through OMV's CGMs were registered in OMV Petrom's E&P division. In 2023, we conducted several evaluations and analyses focusing on managing recurrent grievances, especially regarding historically polluted sites. We are working to resolve issues related to the root causes of recurring grievances, such as handling claims related to land rentals and environmental compensation more efficiently. Our proactive efforts to resolve the grievances resulted in a decrease in the number of registered complaints at OMV Petrom E&P of 8% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n<sup>44</sup> Society category grievances include noise, dust, land acquisition, access to project benefits, or other disturbances relating to OMV activities.\n\n- <sup>46</sup> Environment category grievances include land degradation, water pollution, air pollution, etc.\n- <sup>47</sup> Human rights category grievances include just and favorable working conditions at contractors, child and forced labor, indigenous rights, etc. For more information, see Human Rights.\n\n<sup>45</sup> A grievance is considered \"resolved\" when the proposed resolution by the Company is accepted by the complainant. It remains categorized as \"addressed\" if the proposed resolution is not accepted by the complainant.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- The Petrobrazi refinery has a 24/7 call center service that facilitates communication between the Petrobrazi refinery and all stakeholders wanting to submit complaints or request information. In 2023, the call center was promoted online in the Prahova community. The call center's workflow was also reviewed and the procedure was updated to improve the process.\n- In the first years of the implementation of the Community Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs) in Malaysia, a key finding was that contractors need to frequently be reminded about the availability of the mechanism due to high turnover. In 2023, posters on the availability of the CFM and how to access it were put up in all site offices in several languages.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nWe will take the following actions in the coming years to continue to improve our community relations approach:\n\nOMV Petrom will begin a social and human rights impact assessment (SHIA) for the Neptun Deep project. The Neptun Deep project is the largest natural gas project in the Romanian Black Sea, located about 160 km away from the shoreline in Constanța. The goal of the SHIA is to establish a community baseline study and analysis of the current and potential social and human rights issues affecting the communities near Tuzla and Costinești, and prepare a community engagement strategy, community investment plan, and human rights risk management and due diligence plans in the area.\n\n- At the Petrobrazi refinery, the new working procedure for the call center will be implemented and the call center will continue to be promoted.\n- In OMV Petrom's E&P segment, we intend to continue to investigate root causes and expand on the site investigation and evaluation studies for each historical and recurrent grievance. We will enhance data linkages and management between the Land Management System database and ServiceNow (which houses the grievance management database dedicated to tracking and managing grievances, including the details of the grievances, their status, resolutions, communication records, and any other relevant information related to handling complaints and issues).\n- SapuraOMV will carry out stakeholder engagement activities with fishing communities in the vicinity of its operations and proactively inform them about the availability of the Community Feedback Mechanism.\n\nImage /page/130/Figure/10 description: The image shows information about a target, its status, and the most relevant Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The target for 2025 is to assess the Community Grievance Mechanism at all sites against UN Effectiveness Criteria. The status in 2023 is that 8 out of 9 sites in scope have been assessed. The most relevant SDG is SDG 16, which focuses on peace, justice, and strong institutions. The image also mentions SDG target 16.6, which aims to develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels.\n\n**16.6** Develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels\n\n**16.7** Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making at all levels\n\nNine defined assets on a 100% operator/majority-owned basis from the OMV Energy, Refining, and Power business segments are currently in scope (scope liable to change based on operatorship/divestments). The scope is currently: E&P assets within the Energy segment in Austria, E&P Romania, E&P Tunisia, E&P Yemen, E&P New Zealand, E&P Malaysia, the Schwechat refinery, the Burghausen refinery, the Petrobrazi refinery. 48\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

These include any activities that encompass monetary or non-monetary support and activities beyond core business that aim to contribute to the social welfare and progress of society in general. Our social investments (includes community development projects) aim to create long-term societal value for local communities impacted\n\nby our business and add value to the societies in which we operate.\n\nOur community relations processes and projects help us develop mutual trust and respect between OMV and nearby communities, thus helping us maintain our social license to operate and create win-win situations for all.\n\nImage /page/131/Figure/7 description: The image contains two pie charts showing 2023 investments by main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and by beneficiaries. The left pie chart shows the investments in EUR 45.2 mn, with the following percentages: SDG 17 (55.7%), SDG 3 (11%), SDG 4 (10.4%), SDG 11 (8.7%), SDG 13 (8.5%), SDG 14 (3.2%), SDG 16 (0.4%), SDG 7 (0.4%), SDG 8 (0.1%), and Others (1.8%) which include SDGs 10, 1, 9, 6, 15, 2, 5, and 12. The right pie chart shows the investments in 1 mn beneficiaries, with the following percentages: SDG 3 (17.1%), SDG 4 (16.5%), SDG 1 (10.3%), SDG 17 (12.8%), SDG 14 (37.4%), SDG 13 (1.3%), SDG 7 (0.1%), SDG 11 (0.3%), and Others (4.1%) which include SDGs 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12. The image also includes a legend for the SDGs.\n\n#### **2023 Investments by Main SDGs and by Beneficiaries**\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Needs Assessments**\n\nCommunity development investments are always aligned with identified local needs and made following consultation with local stakeholders, as well as following consideration of country-specific priorities in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We prioritize projects with the potential for generating long-term societal value and making a lasting change to beneficiaries' lives. Community and social investments are aligned with the SDGs and the community needs identified during Social Impact Assessments (SIAs), or with broader societal priorities (e.g., by consulting the Social Progress Index49).\n\nWe aim to implement our projects in partnership with locally active stakeholders or non-governmental organizations to ensure a maximum social return on our investment. We implement our community development projects as investments, and thus expect each project to generate a return for our communities, or society more\n\nbroadly. These initiatives often also include knowledge transfer initiatives aimed at building the local technical capacity of potential workforce or supply chain partners.\n\n#### **Prioritization**\n\nConsistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and supports OMV's social responsibility objectives. OMV has therefore defined three key focus areas for our community and social investments:\n\n- Access to basic services:\n- Education, entrepreneurship, and employment:\n- Climate action and circular resource management:\n\nIn addition to the priorities defined by the Group, individual countries or subsidiaries also identify priorities that are specific to them. For instance, the Borealis Social Fund\n\nThe Social Progress Index, developed by the Social Progress Imperative, is a comprehensive measure of real quality of life, independent of economic indicators across countries. More details can be found at: [www.socialprogress.org](https://www.socialprogress.org/) 49\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nhas defined three areas of social engagement that contribute to SDGs 14, 6, 7, and 4.\n\n#### **Corporate Volunteering**\n\nOMV Group employees are encouraged to personally play an active part in sustainability initiatives, including through volunteering. We offer OMV employees the opportunity to actively engage in encouraging responsible and sustainable behavior and facilitate employee involvement with charitable partners. Group-wide volunteering activities in line with specific targets are part of our community and social investments.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a volunteering action of 18 participants with the Tafel Austria organization, which currently saves up to four tons of food from being destroyed every day and supplies it to around 28,000 people affected by poverty. OMV has been supporting Tafel Austria at various levels for many years. The aim of the cooperation with Tafel Austria is to raise awareness of the issue of poverty and food waste both among our colleagues in the company and in society, and also to provide a better life for people in Austria who are affected by poverty.\n\nWe also continued our tree planting activities in Romania and New Zealand. Over the course of the four-year Romania Plants for Tomorrow campaign, 22,000 volunteers contributed to the planting of 2.8 mn seedlings over an area of 550 hectares. As part of New Zealand's Project Crimson, almost 70,000 native plants have been planted since 2020 and 11 volunteers participated in 2023.\n\nEvery year, tons of rubbish float ashore along the coast of Stavanger and along the entire coast of Norway. Clean Shores is a global non-profit organization that works to keep the world's coastlines clean and free of litter. OMV (Norge) AS is the main sponsor of Clean Shores Global and through this, we support the local community, act as good neighbors, and show that we care. In turn, OMV highlights Clean Shores Global as a partner in its Corporate Social Responsibility profile, and encourages employees of OMV (Norge) AS to participate in volunteer beach cleaning operations. These are organized spontaneously by groups of employees or departments. Around five to ten cleaning sessions take place each year with five to ten participants on average.\n\n#### **Environment Days at OMV Tunisia**\n\nAs part of an international campaign to #BeatPlasticPollution, around 100 employees from OMV Tunisia spent two days volunteering to collect plastic waste either on the beach of Gabès or in the desert of Tataouine. To celebrate World Environment Day (WED), which takes place annually on June 5, 25 people from corporate volunteering, including members of the OMV Tunisia leadership team,\n\nwere present at the beach in Gabès to participate in the \"Run and Plog\" activities jointly organized by OMV and other public sector institutions and local non-government organizations. Participants engaged in a plastic waste collection rally. The Gabès coastline is home to a vulnerable ecosystem in the Mediterranean with increased interest in preserving marine biodiversity (e.g., endangered turtle species). From Gabès, we moved to our sites in the desert of Tataouine. Another cleaning campaign was held in the heart of the desert, where the Waha CPF and Nawara CPF field teams and contractors gathered to pick up littered plastic. Two permanent waste containers were also placed on the road to allow travelers to dispose of plastic bottles in an adequate way.\n\n#### **5,000 Therapy Minutes Donated by OMV Employees**\n\nWe also consider OMV employees' participation in fundraising campaigns as part of our volunteer work. During the CAPE 10 Christmas campaign, OMV employees supported the CAPE 10 Foundation in financing urgently needed therapy hours, especially psychotherapy, for children and young people in Austria in 2024. The donated sum of EUR 4,260 was doubled by OMV and four children and young people at risk of poverty will be able to receive the therapy they need in 2024.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nEUR **45.2** mn in community and social investments<sup>50</sup>\n\n**293** community and social investments in 24 countries\n\n**1** mn beneficiaries reached\n\n**2,471** employee volunteers\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Access to Basic Services**\n\nIn 2023, we continued our plans to invest in infrastructure to improve access to basic services such as health care and water. Our investments have focused on supporting underserved communities or areas with limited access to basic services in countries where we operate, in line with our commitment to respecting human rights. Nevertheless, unforeseen events and disasters can happen at any time. OMV responds immediately to acute problems, e.g., disaster or humanitarian aid, and consistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and support of OMV's social responsibility objectives.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n#### **Humanitarian Aid**\n\nIn 2023, the Borealis Social Fund partnered with the Austrian Red Cross to launch the Borealis Immediate Aid Fund (Borealis ISH Fonds) to provide fast and unbureaucratic financial aid to help people in Austria in financial emergencies. Based on a needs analysis, the fund focuses on helping young families and elderly people in emergency situations where no other support is available. In addition to receiving financial aid, recipients benefit from a consultation with the Austrian Red Cross to help them avoid similar situations in the future.\n\n#### **Victims of the Earthquake in Turkey and Syria**\n\nThe devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria in 2023 was impossible to ignore or forget. The OMV Group put several immediate measures in place and committed to providing substantial support for the Austrian national rescue and emergency teams on the ground in the amount of EUR 0.5 mn.\n\nThe Borealis Social Fund supported those affected by the Turkey and Syria earthquake by contributing to a container city in Adana, Turkey, which was set up temporarily to house families while the area was being rebuilt. Borealis contributed to 34 out of 200 containers and this aided 152 people.\n\n#### **OMV's Response to Catastrophic Flooding in Libya**\n\nHeavy rainfall caused by Storm Daniel resulted in severe flooding in several areas in eastern Libya in September 2023. The worst affected was Derna, where a part of the Wadi Derna dam was washed away and large sections of the city were rendered uninhabitable by the floods. Two dams upstream of the city burst one after the other, releasing huge volumes of water that rushed down the valley and flooded the area, destroying roads, bridges, and buildings and killing thousands of people.\n\nOMV's employees and assets in Libya were not affected. OMV Libya was actively involved with the NOC (National Oil Corporation) Emergency Management Committee, and together with other international companies operating in Libya, immediately offered support to meet the urgent humanitarian needs in the eastern region of Libya. OMV demonstrated one of the fastest responses to this devastating event by delivering two urgently needed 1 MW generator sets to support the affected areas within three days.\n\n#### **Together from Day One, Romania**\n\nThrough the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom extended its support for early health initiatives. Under the Together from the First Day program, OMV Petrom invested EUR 1 mn to equip 45 maternity wards and neonatal units in 28 counties. This resulted in improved\n\nneonatal care for over 20,000 newborns, contributing to a reduction in infant mortality. Furthermore, the First Step to Health project aimed to equip 39 family practitioners' offices to improve prenatal care by providing essential support for 7,000 pregnant women and young children. Finally, the Baby Box program received financing of EUR 1.58 mn to provide vital assistance and health information to 2,713 mothers and newborns in vulnerable circumstances. More Information can be found on the [OMV](https://www.omvpetrom.com/en/sustainability/omv-petrom-foundation) [Petrom website.](https://www.omvpetrom.com/en/sustainability/omv-petrom-foundation)\n\n#### **WISE Charitable Trust for Healthy Homes in Taranaki, New Zealand**\n\nSupport for the WISE insulation program for healthy homes enabled 264 homes in the Taranaki region to be insulated in 2023. Through OMV New Zealand's support of the Bellyful program, 1,942 meals were provided to 269 mothers with young babies in need.\n\n#### **Water and Energy: Water for the World Program**\n\nAccess to water and energy are fundamental as they affect the ability of poor families to obtain sufficient food and protect their health, as well as limiting the livelihoods and educational opportunities available to them. Since 2007, Borealis and Borouge have provided solutions through Water for the World, a joint program to address the global water and energy challenge in rural and urban communities, with a focus on South-East Asia and Africa. The program cooperates with a range of non-profit organizations and supports numerous projects across Asia and Africa, including in China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nepal, Morocco, Myanmar, and Pakistan, benefiting over one million people since its inception.\n\nWater for the World celebrated its 15-year anniversary in 2023. Based on a joint vision and global concept, the two companies followed different local implementation strategies tailored to the companies' organization and local needs. The two approaches complement each other: With activities in Asia and the Middle East and in regions with water scarcity or the need to extend water infrastructure to remote regions, Borouge implemented a variety of projects in a number of countries in that region, each with a respective local/national NGO and supported by the respective Borealis employee in charge of Borouge's activities in that country.\n\nWith the majority of its activities in Europe where the challenge is mostly related to old infrastructure leading to water leaks, Borealis focused on supporting awareness raising, for example through water roadshows/exhibitions and supporting the Stockholm Water Prize, improving knowledge on topics such as preventing water leaks caused by aging water infrastructure, efficient water use in agriculture/sustainable water practices in agriculture, and\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/134/Picture/0 description: The image contains the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

In addition, since 2007, Borealis has worked in partnership with Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor to provide funding and in-kind materials to support their activities on the African continent.\n\nThe program was expanded in 2017, and in addition to water infrastructure, renewable infrastructure projects were also implemented. The first project was launched in Myanmar with the installation of photovoltaic modules in a hospital in Kanni, which was followed by a project in Uganda.\n\nOver the last 15 years, the water challenges faced by the world have changed and today include the consequences of climate change, such as increased natural disasters, floods, and droughts. Therefore, during 2024, the program will be reviewed and the conceptual approach and project portfolio adapted to meet the societal needs of today and the future.\n\n#### **Status 2023**\n\nSince it began in 2007, Water for the World has reached more than 1 mn people and implemented over 20 projects in more than 20 countries.\n\nImage /page/134/Figure/8 description: This image is a timeline titled \"Water for the World Highlights\". The timeline starts in 2007 with the launch in Dusseldorf at the 2007 K-Fair. In 2008, there was a launch in Abu Dhabi and at the Singapore International Water Week. In 2008-2009, there was a Troubled Water Exhibition touring across all Borealis locations. In 2009, they were recognized by the TRIGOS AWARD, the Austrian Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Award. In 2012, 5 Years Water for the World 300,000 people reached. In 2014, they reached 50,000 people in Nairobi, Kenya, through a W4W project in collaboration with OFID and WSUP\\*. In 2017, 10 Years Water for the World 800,000 people reached. In 2019, there was expansion towards renewable energy. First projects in Myanmar and Malawi. In 2023, 15 Years Water for the World over 1 million people reached.\n\nWSUP: Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor; OFID: OPEC Fund\n\nAdditional projects contributing to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 can be found on the [OMV website.](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility/community-projects-initiatives)\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Education, Entrepreneurship, Inclusion, and Employment**\n\nIn 2023, we continued to develop community projects that promote self-sufficiency, job growth, and economic development within communities impacted by our business operations. Education, entrepreneurship, and employment are key factors in socioeconomic development and positively contribute to numerous other SDGs. OMV has been involved in community and social investments focused on education, entrepreneurship, and employment for many years now. We invest in vocational training, microlending, scholarships, and building supplier capacity. Some of the key initiatives that the OMV Group has been actively involved in include:\n\n#### **Tasharok: Empowering Communities in Tunisia**\n\nOMV Tunisia completed the Tasharok project in Gabès, which was celebrated with the community in the presence of regional officials and OMV partners. The aim of this project was to bring about a positive change in Basboussa and Bouchemma, two communities in the vicinity of the Nawara Gas Treatment Plant (GTP), by: enhancing the city's waste management services in collaboration with the municipality, and equipping it with the necessary materials and equipment; collaborating with a local micro-grant program for the benefit of Basboussa community members so they can create small-scale economic activities to improve their financial situation and support their families; and bringing people together to organize and support each other in resolving community issues through the creation of a community-based organization, and acting as a representative for the Basboussa neighborhood.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nSouthlabs is a start-up support initiative aiming to drive innovation in south Tunisia, namely Tataouine and Gabès. Twenty beneficiaries from both regions have been selected to benefit from a coaching program that allows them to apply for the start-up initiative run by the state. The program provides business plan improvement, communication, marketing, and fundraising training. Having applied for and received the start-up label, beneficiaries will benefit from early-stage funding of up to EUR 100,000.\n\n#### **Early Childhood Education and Care in Romania**\n\nIn Romania, the participation rate in early education has decreased in recent years and is among the lowest in Europe. Through the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom has been able to support early education projects. The Start in Education project targets 60,000 preschool children (age 3–6) from underprivileged communities, with the aim of enhancing their school readiness. The educational project addresses the immediate needs of the most vulnerable preschool children, mostly from rural areas, and aims to facilitate their access to educational resources, with early learning experiences managed by parents at home. This has resulted in increased enrolment in the kindergarten.\n\nIn the 2023–2024 school year, ABC Kindergarten teaching kits will continue to be provided for 1,500 kindergartens, and training programs in the field of interactive education and parenting will be organized for 3,500 educators. The project will also support another 60,000 preschool children and 10,000 parents in 41 counties with educational resources and parenting workshops. Thanks to this, the number of children benefiting from the Future in a Schoolbag educational kit has reached 120,000, and the number of parents participating in the School of Parents workshop reached 23,000. Also, the \"Let's be friends – no bullying in kindergartens\" project trained 600 specialists from 60 kindergartens to work during the 2023-2024 school year with over 8,000 children on the \"Let's be friends\" methodology, which is based on the philosophy that a strong sense of community and positive relationships between children prevent exclusion and bullying. Besides training, the 60 kindergartens also received the package of educational resources to be used by the educators and integrated into their daily routine of activities with children and parents.\n\n#### **Vocational School**\n\nOMV Petrom continued to support dual education in Romania with donations of around EUR 300,000 in 2023. The Petrochemical School is a dual-system program supported by OMV Petrom. The future petrochemists benefit from professional training in the field of petrochemicals and internships at the Petrobrazi refinery. Approximately 100 students received scholarships worth up to EUR 130 during their studies. We have almost 100 students in the four dual education classes, and three classes with around 75 students graduated in 2023. Upon completion of the three years of vocational education (petrochemical operators' qualification), students will acquire a recognized professional qualification and will have employment opportunities within our Company. The Petrochemical School program is a pilot project with the aim of assuring a constant and sustainable flow of a high-quality bluecollar workers.\n\n#### **SapuraOMV Upgrades Water Gravity Pipes and a School Library**\n\nSince 2023, SapuraOMV has collaborated with the Kuching Resident Office as part of their Village Transformation program. One project involved partly upgrading an existing water gravity pipe network that links fresh clean water from the waterfall dam to the nearby village (Kampung Seboboq), which currently has 119 households and over 700 residents in the B40 category. By upgrading the water gravity pipes, the villagers will have access to fresh clean water with no disruption.\n\nThe second project with the Kuching Resident Office's Village Transformation program is to upgrade the existing library at Tringgus Elementary School. It has been 20 years since the school's wooden library received any upgrades. The donation will go toward purchasing new tables and chairs plus reference and reading materials for both teachers and schoolchildren. In addition to that, SapuraOMV will also be running a donation drive to collect used story books for the library.\n\n#### **House of Science, New Zealand**\n\nIn partnership with House of Science, 418 science resource kits have been delivered to 37 local Taranaki schools in New Zealand. This enables children to further explore the subject of science in primary schools.\n\n#### **Cultural Treasures for Our Youth**\n\nAs part of OMV's sponsoring partnerships, we provide targeted support for educational and youth activities in all our projects and give young people access to art and culture. For many years, we have invited children and young people from Max & Lara from our partner CAPE 10 to experience and learn from cultural events organized by our sponsoring partners. In 2023, over 100 children and their parents attended such events organized by OMV sponsoring partners. This doesn't just provide opportunities to learn and experience art, but also to experience and participate in cultural life in our society. We therefore consider these opportunities as a contribution to our social responsibility.\n\n#### **CODY21: Digital Education Program in Austria**\n\nAs digitalization is becoming more and more important to the youngest members of society, we are offering virtual\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle with an arrow going around it.\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\neducation in elementary schools in Lower Austria through interactive video units on basic digital education. OMV finances the CODY21 platform and thus makes an important social contribution to education and equal opportunities for a total of 3,200 school children in OMV's partner communities. In 2023, we also donated 400 laptops to partnering schools with the aim of providing more possibilities for pupils and teachers in regard to digitalization.\n\n#### **WELCOME TO THE FUTURE! Exhibition**\n\nBorealis has been one of the main sponsors of the ZOOM Children's Museum in Vienna, Austria, since 2013. The ZOOM Children's Museum and Borealis share the common goal of helping to make complex sustainability issues understandable for the younger generation, getting them excited about science and research, and sharpening their skills for future challenges. In 2023, the Borealis Social Fund and the ZOOM Children's Museum in Vienna celebrated the opening of a new hands-on exhibition, WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!, which deals with the sustainability challenges of tomorrow's world. For this purpose, ZOOM has transformed the exhibition hall into a Future Lab where artists, scientists, and experts from a wide variety of areas contributed their ideas for our future. The ZOOM Children's Museum welcomes children to ask questions, to touch and to feel, to examine and to play to their heart's content. In their own individual way, they zoom in on objects and situations and, in doing so, find out about themselves and discover their own skills, abilities, and creativity.\n\n#### **Ecopost for Fair and Regular Income Generation**\n\nBorealis and Ecopost formed a collaboration where Borealis will fund Ecopost's activities to boost waste recycling in Kenya and to promote a circular economy in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Borealis will specifically support capacity building, training, and engaging more waste collectors, as well as formalization of their work by funding entrepreneurial start-up kits for the youth and women's groups.\n\nAdditional projects contributing to SDGs 4, 5, 8, and 10 can be found on the [OMV website](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility/community-projects-initiatives).\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Climate, Energy, and Circular Resource Management**\n\nClimate and environmental changes inevitably affect communities around the world and their livelihoods, health, and opportunities. We can no longer afford to tackle the social challenges the world faces without recognizing the extent of the effects environmental changes can have on people and their health and well-being. Climate change, access to sustainable energy, and environmental protection are key priorities in our community and social development efforts.\n\n#### **Environmental initiatives supported by the Petrom Foundation**\n\nPart of the environmental initiatives of the Petrom Foundation is the Green for Future program, which invested EUR 1 mn in Vânători-Neamt Natural Park. The focus is on enhancing the biodiversity conservation, wildlife management, and community development. Furthermore, the Green for the Alpha Generation program developed students' skills in addressing climate change in their communities and benefited 147 teachers and 2,900 pupils across 26 counties through curricula and projects aimed at combating climate change.\n\n#### **RoEficientă: Energy Efficiency in Romania**\n\nRomânia Eficientă is a unique initiative in Romania that aims to create a culture of energy efficiency in the building sector. There are two main components and goals that drive this project: firstly, information, education, and public awareness, and secondly, carrying out major renovations based on NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings) standards at a couple of the public schools in Romanian counties, including building a pilot school in Ploiești. This initiative is strongly backed by the energy and climate policies in the European Union and is largely centered around the principle of energy efficiency.\n\nThe project becomes all the more important in the context of the European Green Deal, which places great emphasis on energy efficiency, one of the main pillars of the new European policies, and on building renovation. In 2023, we decided to launch a new concept, more applicable to the current educational needs, in addition to what we are already doing. In order to show and explain the impact of school renovation and the multiple benefits of modern energy-efficient buildings, this new educational concept is based on direct learning from specialists. Therefore, through visits to school and universities, we will focus on educating the children and young people, creating educational materials (which can be accessed anywhere and anytime from the official platform [https://www.romania-efi](https://www.romania-eficienta.ro/)[cienta.ro/\\)](https://www.romania-eficienta.ro/), educating teachers to promote energy efficiency measures to the younger generation, and educating the general public through practical experiences/models (school renovations, Doza de Energie/Energy Dose video productions and influencers).\n\nThe Liliești High School was the largest private investment for the energy renovation of an educational establishment in Romania (worth up to EUR 1.6 mn). By renovating to NZEB standard, the school will have less impact on the environment and will also be more resilient to the impact of climate change. The refurbishment works at Liliești High School will result in an annual reduction of around 60% in the energy consumption for heating the building. The fivepump heat system contributes to this result. In addition,\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nthe school will benefit from \"green\" electricity, obtained from its own sources, through a system of 30 photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 550W each. Its inauguration took place on March 20, 2023.\n\nRomânia Eficientă has reached its fourth phase, which means renovation works at the Zig-Zag Kindergarten in Ovidiu (Constanța) are in full swing, with completion estimated for March 2024. The kindergarten has undergone an extensive renovation process, including works to increase energy performance to bring it up to NZEB requirements and consolidation and capacity expansion works. The building will be upgraded from energy efficiency class E (lowest limit class G) to the highest energy class (A). Total annual energy consumption will be reduced by more than 60% and carbon emissions by about six times. The building will be equipped with renewable energy systems, i.e., photovoltaic panels and heat pumps. In parallel, we have also started preparing the documentation for a school in Șimian (Mehedinți).\n\n#### **OMV Petrom Supports Circular Economy Projects with Social Impact**\n\nIn 2023, OMV Petrom continued several initiatives to raise awareness about the circular economy and foster the transition to a circular economy in Romania. For instance, circular economy initiatives with social impact include the \"Let's Click on Romania\" project, a collaboration between private companies and the NGO Ateliere fără Frontiere. In this project, 4,000 computers were refurbished and donated by private companies to over 200 institutions such as schools, NGOs and kindergartens, reducing CO2 emissions by around 500 t. The project also proposes a model of good practice at the national level regarding the circular economy, and through this example provides access for young people from marginalized rural and urban environments to a better education. This includes resources related to the transition to a green economy, an area still undeveloped in rural areas even though it is a necessary one for the evolution of human society as a whole. The project endeavors to have a positive impact on the environment by reusing and donating electronic waste to equip the school's computer labs and classrooms, thus extending their life cycle. NGOs have also managed to incorporate some very rarely mentioned subjects into school life: circular economy, reusing materials, and sustainability.\n\nOMV Petrom supports a circular project by giving furniture a new life in 18 communities in Romania. In 2023, it redirected over 4,400 pieces of furniture to communities in Constanța, Prahova, Dâmbovița, Olt, Dolj, Arges, Brasov Buzau, Bucuresti, and Iași counties.\n\n#### **Waste and Resource Efficiency: Project STOP**\n\nEnvironmental pollution caused by littering is a global challenge. Millions of tons of plastic waste leak into the environment and oceans every year. Mismanaged waste is adversely affecting the region's ocean ecosystems, livelihoods, human health, and sustainable development more broadly. An important solution is to accelerate the transformation toward a circular economy. A key enabler for this is stopping waste leakage at the source by establishing lowcost, efficient, and circular waste management systems.\n\n#### **Project STOP Highlights 2023**\n\nCo-founded by Borealis and Systemiq, with broad support from national and regional governments, international institutions, academia, and the private sector, Project STOP focuses on delivering measurable impact on the ground. Since its inception in 2017, it has steadily extended from the first city of Muncar to two more cities, Pasuruan and Jembrana. To ensure the system continues to function effectively after formal handover, a comprehensive education program was developed in the three cities to train municipal employees, and the Project STOP team will remain available for support and advice. Read more about Project STOP in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/about-us/debt-investor-relations/results-and-reports)\n\nA key highlight in 2023 was the inauguration of a new material recovery facility (MRF) in Songgon Municipality, Banyuwangi, East Java, representing a key milestone on the path to building Indonesia's first regency-led circular waste management system as part of the Project STOP Banyuwangi Hijau expansion plan. One of the largest of its kind in Indonesia to date, the new MRF will manage waste collection and sorting from households in the region, including materials to be recycled, with a daily capacity to process up to 84 t of waste. The MRF will collect all waste, including 3,300 t of plastic waste per year, at full scale by 2025. This expansion program consists of three consecutive phases and was kicked off in early 2023, with completion scheduled for the end of 2025. By that time, Project STOP aims to positively impact the lives of up to 2 mn residents, create 1,000 full-time jobs, and annually collect 230,000 t of waste, including the 25,000 t of plastic that has been collected since the inception of Project STOP in 2017.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

To gain a better overview of all our projects we promote communication on our media channels. Consistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and supports OMV's social responsibility objectives and its reputation.\n\nIn 2024, we will review our prioritization of focus areas in line with our sustainability strategy and define common Groupwide areas that take into consideration the ongoing energy transition and climate change. We will also continue our ongoing social projects to meet the needs of people in the communities where we do business.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of social investments in all countries where we conduct business or operate, also including in times of crisis, a target has been clearly defined in the Strategy 2030. Based on this, we want to implement a social fund so we can act immediately and in a straightforward way, especially in the event of acute problems such as disasters or humanitarian crises, and provide long-term perspectives for our project partners. Furthermore, we want to provide consistent communication about our programs. OMV fully benefits from the high impact and visibility of relevant projects and initiatives.\n\nImage /page/138/Figure/15 description: The image shows information about targets and status related to social goals. The target for 2030 is to direct at least 1% of Group investments per year toward social goals, based on the previous year's reported net income attributable to stockholders of the parent. The status for 2023 is 1.2%. The most relevant SDGs are SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). SDG target 1.4 states that by 2030, all men and women, particularly the poor and vulnerable, should have equal rights to economic resources.\n\naccess to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance\n\n**8.3** Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services\n\n<sup>51</sup> In 2023, OMV's reported net income attributable to stockholders of the parent was EUR 3,634 mn. Our social expenditures in 2023 were particularly high because of donations for humanitarian causes in Turkey and Libya. At OMV Petrom, EUR 23 mn was distributed after the end of the 2022 financial year. This distribution was facilitated by the new fiscal facility Form 177, approved by National Agency of Fiscal Administration Order No. 1679/2022, which is used to redirect the corporate tax, as applicable, toward sponsorship, patronage, or the granting of private scholarships.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a blue circle.\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles.

It is therefore imperative that we act in accordance with the highest ethical standards on an international level, everywhere we operate, and enforce these standards throughout our supply chain. Unethical behavior, such as corruption, hinders economic and sustainable development.\n\nOMV is a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, and we believe that sustainability starts with our value system and a principles-based approach to doing business. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. The Ethical Business Practices strategic focus area brings together our commitments and actions relating to the integrity of our employees and business partners. Establishing a culture of integrity is the baseline for the further adoption of the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, whether that is achieved by promoting local economic development through local procurement, or ensuring that our public policy engagement and work with suppliers is in line with OMV's climate commitments.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

In the upper left corner is the number \"16\" in white. To the right of the number, the words \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\" are stacked in white, block letters. Below the text is a white dove holding an olive branch in its beak. Below the dove is a white gavel.\n\nOMV is defined by the way our people behave. Conducting business sustainably and ethically is crucial for OMV in creating and protecting value in the long term, in building trusting partnerships, and in attracting customers and the best suppliers, investors, and employees. We strive to comply with the most stringent legal requirements in areas such as anti-corruption and tax law, and to be transparent and implement sound corporate governance to ensure ethical behavior. The principles of corporate governance are a key element for the sustainable growth of the business, for enhancing long-term value for shareholders, and for strengthening stakeholder confidence.<sup>52</sup>\n\nOMV's Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics publicly lay out our commitments to responsible and ethical business conduct. OMV's Code of Business Ethics sets out a zero-tolerance policy on bribery, fraud, theft, and other forms of corruption, as well as money laundering, and prohibits any support of political parties or donations to them. This Code applies to all employees. It is designed to comply with the standards set by both national and international anti-corruption legislation (mainly the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and the UK Bribery Act). OMV is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and adheres to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These Guidelines reflect the government expectations of responsible conduct by businesses. They cover all key areas of business responsibility, including bribery, competition, and taxation. OMV has also published a separate Tax Policy.\n\n#### Governance\n\nUltimate responsibility for ensuring the ethical conduct of OMV while generating economic value lies with the Executive and Supervisory Boards. Responsibility for economic impacts and business principles is not centralized in one department, but rather distributed across various departments. For instance, the OMV Compliance Management System is implemented Group-wide through collaboration between central management units and local compliance officers in all countries in which OMV operates.\n\nThe Group's approach to tax and the risks related to it are monitored by the tax function (as part of Group Finance) and overseen by the CFO and the Supervisory Board. Tax compliance is generally dealt with by finance managers, and at legal entity level by local tax managers, shared service centers, or external tax advisors. OMV's Tax Compliance functions and departments report to OMV's CFO.\n\nThe Public Affairs and International Relations team is the OMV Group's interface with the relevant political and public administration decision-makers. It informs stakeholders in Austria as well as at EU and international level about OMV's business, so that they understand how the oil, gas, and chemical industry works, the challenges it faces today, and the contribution it will make in the future. Relationships with stakeholders are sustainable and based on transparency and mutual trust. Public Affairs and International Relations reports to OMV's CEO.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThe Company's management is committed to establishing and maintaining an ethical standard of trust and integrity in our day-to-day business. Our senior management signs a Compliance Declaration to confirm that their conduct is in line with the Code of Business Ethics. New members of senior management also receive personal onboarding conducted by Compliance to introduce OMV's integrity standards. In addition, once a year, all managers and employees in particularly exposed positions must sign a conflict of interest and business ethics conformity declaration.\n\nEach member of the Executive board (EB) and the Supervisory Board (SB) is personally trained by Compliance in all relevant compliance areas. In addition, there are regular Jour fixes and ad hoc meetings with the entire EB and with each individual member of the EB, regular Audit Committee meetings with the SB, and Jour fixes with the chairman of the SB, where compliance-related matters are reported and discussed.\n\n### Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption\n\nThe OMV Group is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. Although we are headquartered in Austria, a country with high standards of business ethics, we operate in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Americas, and Europe that are defined as high risk by the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. We strive to avoid the risks of bribery and corruption that are specific to our sector. We also highly value our reputation. Therefore, our highest priority is ensuring uniform compliance with our business ethics standards wherever we operate.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards is a non-negotiable value that supersedes any business interest. Absolute commitment to this objective is embedded at all levels of the OMV Group, from top management to every employee. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. Every company activity, from planning business strategy to daily operations, is assessed for compliance with ethical standards such as the [Code of Conduct](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522177201471/code-of-conduct.pdf) and [Code of Business Ethics.](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522138416551/business-ethics-brochure.pdf)\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group follows a zero-tolerance policy regarding bribery, fraud, theft, and other forms of corruption, as well as money laundering. Based on this policy, the OMV Group is committed to detecting any potential policy violations at the earliest stage, thoroughly investigating any such incidents of non-compliance, and determining appropriate organizational measures or sanctions for the individuals involved. The integrity of our employees is the\n\nfoundation of the trust placed in our Company by our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure that OMV's commitment to business integrity is clear, OMV has introduced a Code of Conduct53, which reflects both the required standards and the high expectations of our shareholders. The Code of Conduct expresses OMV's values and defines OMV's mindset in conducting business responsibly, with the focus on ethical and legal standards, among other things.\n\nThe Code of Conduct applies to all OMV Group employees. All suppliers and business partners are required to share OMV's values and comply with the defined ethical and legal standards. A separate Code of Business Ethics further describes how OMV fulfills ethical and legal responsibilities internally. It defines the rules and procedures for conflicts of interest, gifts and invitations, donations and sponsorships, intermediaries and lobbyists, as well as for other areas of law such as trade sanctions, money laundering, and fair competition. OMV has also implemented regulations for compliance with capital markets law, including the prevention of insider trading. These regulations are included in a separate guideline: the Issuer Compliance Standard.\n\nBoth the Code of Conduct and the Code of Business Ethics are signed by the OMV Executive Board and apply in all countries where OMV does business. The procedures established by these documents are implemented at every fully consolidated subsidiary of OMV and apply to everyone who works for OMV or on behalf of OMV. We require compliance with international business principles from all parties with whom we enter into partnership agreements, such as joint ventures. Companies performing services for OMV (i.e., suppliers) must follow antibribery and anti-corruption procedures that are consistent with the principles of OMV's Code of Business Ethics and with OMV's business ethics standards, as defined in the Code of Conduct (for more details, see Supply Chain).\n\nThe internal Whistleblowing Directive lays out how employees and external stakeholders can confidentially and anonymously make a whistleblowing report, particularly regarding corruption and bribes, conflicts of interest, competition law, and capital markets law. The Directive also specifies how cases are handled and defines special protection for whistleblowers against any form of retaliation, which comprises all actions or omissions in a workrelated context such as dismissal, demotion, denial of promotion, negative performance appraisal, or disciplinary measures.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has set up a comprehensive Compliance Management System based on the requirements of IDW PS 980<sup>54</sup>, including policies, audits, and training. The system aims to anchor OMV's business ethics policies throughout the organization and to ensure their correct implementation.\n\nThe design and implementation of OMV's Compliance Management System have repeatedly been externally audited for adequacy and effectiveness. The result of each audit was that OMV's system is appropriately designed and effectively implemented in order to prevent, detect, and respond to systematic misconduct in the legal areas of business ethics/anti-corruption, capital market law, competition law, and trade sanctions.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments and Audits**\n\nBoth external and internal risk factors, in particular changes to the regulatory framework, as well as recent developments or incidents, are monitored on an ongoing basis to evaluate their possible impact on OMV's current risk exposure. This ongoing risk analysis also includes an institutionalized semi-annual risk analysis, which is part of OMV's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM). If new risks are identified, OMV undertakes measures to address them.\n\nBefore we launch activities in a new country, we perform a thorough analysis of business ethics and sanction law issues in that country. The Business Ethics Entry Assessment includes an analysis of the Corruption Perceptions Index assigned by Transparency International to a given country. Based on the outcome of the assessment, corporate governance in local operations is adapted to assure compliance with OMV's ethical standards. OMV has implemented a process for screening both potential new and existing business partners using EU and US sanction lists. In addition to those sanction checks, more exhaustive due diligence assessments are conducted prior to engagement with a business partner or during the business relationship as needed.\n\nCritically, counterparties in M&A transactions, strategic partnerships, or business partners that have been in the media spotlight in the context of illegal conduct are assessed in greater depth. Such an assessment involves the potential business partner, their direct and indirect shareholders, other investors, and the ultimate beneficiaries of directly or indirectly involved legal entities. To that end, OMV uses its standardized know-your-customer (KYC) questionnaire to request information from counterparties so they can assess corruption, money laundering, sanctions, and other illicit conduct risks.\n\nKey red flags are connections to government officials, other individuals, and companies referred to in high-attention media reports related to political and corruption cases, sanctioned entities, or any other suspected involvement in illegal conduct. In cases where intermediaries, lobbyists, or consultants are engaged, we use a third-party service provider to do comprehensive research, including source inquiries. Furthermore, vendor assessments are conducted by the OMV Procurement department.\n\nIn 2022, Borealis was certified according to ISO 37301 (Compliance Management) and ISO 37001 (Anti-Bribery Management Systems) by Austrian Standards following a two-phase audit process conducted by Taylor Wessing.\n\n#### **Whistleblowing**\n\nWe have established channels to help identify ethical misconduct as early as possible. Timely notification is crucial for taking precautionary measures directed at avoiding or mitigating major financial loss or reputational harm. If an employee observes or becomes aware of potential or actual misconduct or violation of internal rules or statutory regulations, whether committed by other employees or by a business partner, that employee is encouraged to speak up and report the incident.\n\nBesides employees, other stakeholders also represent a valuable source of information, and can help identify breaches of ethical standards. To this end, the OMV Group has introduced a whistleblower mechanism – the Integrity Platform. Anyone can access it online ([omv-group.integri](https://omv-group.integrityplatform.org/)[typlatform.org](https://omv-group.integrityplatform.org/)) and confidentially report an issue, be it related to topics such as corruption, bribes, conflicts of interest, antitrust law, or capital markets law. The report can be filed anonymously, if desired. In addition, Borealis has an Ethics Hotline that is available in 24 languages and allows employees and external stakeholders to raise concerns anonymously.\n\nSpecial protection is given to employees in their capacity as whistleblowers when information is provided in good faith. Notifications will not lead to any disadvantages at any time. Any whistleblowing report is treated with the strictest confidence, carefully checked in all regards, and further handled by the Whistleblowing Committee, which includes members of senior management.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nIt is of strategic importance for us to make sure that every single employee is fully aware of our ethical values and principles. Business ethics training includes training employees on dealing with invitations, gifts, and potential conflicts of interest. In addition, employees are trained in the topics of donations and sponsorships, as well as the\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nrequirements for dealing with intermediaries and lobbyists.\n\nThe online training module in business ethics, which is rolled out biannually, is aimed at all employees of the OMV Group, while participants in classroom training courses are selected according to risk-specific criteria, such as working in the Sales or Procurement departments. The training on antitrust law that we provide focuses on the rules for dealing with competitors, customers, and suppliers. Participants in online and face-to-face training sessions are selected and invited to attend a regular training cycle according to risk-specific criteria. All target groups are defined at the beginning of the training cycle based on the existing organization. Organizational and personnel changes during a training cycle are continuously taken into account.\n\n#### **Raising Awareness**\n\nOMV has launched a compliance app that employees can use on their cell phones, providing easily accessible resources and related tools for all compliance-related matters. Employees can submit inquiries on all ethics topics, for instance gifts, invitations, or conflicts of interest, have their sponsorships or donations checked and registered, have new business partners checked against trade sanction and embargo lists, learn how to deal with inside information and file for trading approval, submit inquiries with regards to antitrust matters and obtain guidance, retrieve useful guidance on all ethics topics, and submit reports on ethical misconduct via the secure Integrity Platform messaging service.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**26** whistleblowing cases in the OMV Group\n\n**0** incidents of corruption, **0** incidents when contracts with business partners or employees were terminated or not renewed due to violations related to corruption\n\n**0** public legal cases involving corruption brought against the organization or its employees during the reporting period\n\n**3** legal actions pending during the reporting period with regard to anti-corruption activities and violations of antitrust and monopoly legislation, in which the organization has been identified as a participant<sup>55</sup>\n\nIn 2023, OMV's Compliance Management System was audited by Ernst & Young (EY) in accordance with the Auditing Standard (PS) 980 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) in the areas of business ethics/anticorruption, antitrust law, capital market law, and trade sanctions. The aim of the audit was to reevaluate the Compliance Management System for the aforementioned compliance areas in order to make any necessary adjustments and align with new trends. In its audit report, EY confirmed that OMV operates an ambitious, well-established, and mature compliance program. OMV's Compliance Management System is appropriately designed for all compliance areas and is effectively implemented across the OMV Group.\n\nIn addition, OMV introduced a new Ethics & Integrity Policy that defines the principles of what it means to act ethically and with integrity. This policy should guide the way that business is conducted within OMV, what is considered acceptable or desirable behavior, above and beyond compliance with laws and regulations. The Ethics & Integrity Policy forms a part of OMV's values and underpins OMV's value \"we care.\" The Ethics & Integrity Policy is supported by a newly established Ethics & Integrity Committee, which shall provide reassurance that the organization is living up to its ethical values and commitments.\n\nIn 2023, Borealis received recertifications for ISO 37301 and ISO 37001. It also implemented new policies and processes to manage social compliance and external whistleblowing, including an improved due diligence, monitoring, auditing, and escalation procedure for business partners. The outcome was an updated Ethics Policy for Business Partners, which includes new compliance requirements for supplier contracts.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, the Ethics & Integrity Policy will be consistently implemented through various communications initiatives and engagement measures in local branch offices. At an entity level, Borealis will seek certification for Social Compliance Standard SA8000 and recertifications for ISO 37301 and ISO 37001.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, the Competition Council in Moldova initiated an investigation into several oil companies, including Petrom Moldova SRL, in relation to the manner of determining sale prices of main petroleum products and LPG. On April 12, 2021, Petrom Moldova SRL received a statement of objections from the Competition Council regarding an alleged price fixing practice. Petrom Moldova SRL submitted its observations to the statement of objections in July 2021 and denied any wrongdoing. The hearing of the parties took place on April 5, 2022. On October 6, 2020, the Polish Competition Authority UOKiK issued a decision with respect to OMV's financing of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. In this decision, UOKiK concluded that this financing arrangement breaches Polish merger control rules and imposed a fine of EUR 19.571 mn on OMV. OMV appealed that decision. On November 21, 2022, the Polish Competition Court annulled in its entirety the decision of UOKiK. On October 16, 2023, the Polish Court of Appeals dismissed UOKiK's appeal against that judgment. As a result, UOKiK's decision to fine OMV was canceled by the Polish courts. In September 2023, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine started an investigation into OMV Gas Marketing Trading & Finance BV for allegedly performing a \"concerted action\" by entering into the Nord Stream 2 financing agreements. OMV contested the allegations on October 31, 2023. 55\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

We pay corporate income taxes, royalties, production taxes, stamp duties, as well as employment and other taxes. In addition, we collect and pay payroll taxes, and indirect taxes such as excise duties and VAT. The taxes we collect and pay represent a significant part of our economic contribution to the countries in which we operate.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nAt OMV, we are committed to complying with tax laws in a responsible manner and to having open and constructive relationships with tax authorities, which is also reflected in OMV's public [Tax Strategy.](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522188630446/dload_Sustainability_Tax%20Strategy_en) Our tax planning supports OMV's business and reflects our commercial and economic activity. OMV does not engage in aggressive tax planning, which consists of artificial structures put in place merely to save taxes or of transactions lacking economic substance aimed at obtaining undue tax advantages. We comply with applicable tax laws and seek to limit the risk of uncertainty or disputes. We perform transactions between OMV Group companies on an arm's length basis and in accordance with the OECD principles currently in force.\n\nOMV Group companies are established in suitable jurisdictions, giving consideration to our business activities and the prevailing regulatory environment. OMV does not establish its subsidiaries in countries that do not follow international\n\nstandards of transparency and exchange of information on tax matters, unless justified by operational requirements in line with OMV's Code of Business Ethics and our Code of Conduct. The Global Tax Directive is the key internal guidance document governing taxes within the OMV Group.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nWe continuously carry out risk reviews, which incorporate tax risks, in order to assess our current and future financial and non-financial risks, assess how these trends will impact OMV, and then develop appropriate responses. We report key risks internally at least twice a year to the Supervisory Board through a very clearly defined process. The Executive Board drives OMV's commitment to the risk management program and sets the tone for a strong culture of risk awareness across the organization.\n\nWe follow OMV's risk management system as part of our internal control processes. We identify, assess, and manage tax risks by implementing risk management measures at the operational level with a robust and complex set of controls and procedures. These guarantee that the correctness of data included in the relevant tax returns, tax payments, and communications with tax authorities is verified in a timely manner. The effectiveness and relevance of these controls and procedures is periodically\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nassessed in order to promptly undertake any necessary mitigation and modifications.\n\n#### **Disclosure**\n\nSince 2016, OMV has been providing mandatory disclosures under the Payment to Governments Directive (in accordance with Section 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code) and publishes any payments made to governments in connection with exploration and extraction activities, such as production entitlements, taxes, or royalties, in its consolidated financial statements (for more details, see the Consolidated Report on the Payments Made to Governments in the [Annual Report](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/further-information/payments-made-to-governments)). In addition, OMV reports payments made to public authorities, such as taxes or royalties in connection with exploration and extraction activities, in countries that are members of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). We also file a country-by-country report (CbCR) for the OMV Group with the Austrian tax authorities. This is carried out in accordance with Action 13 of the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. The CbCR is an annual tax return that breaks down key elements of the financial statements by tax jurisdiction. OMV will publish a public country-by-country report in accordance with the requirements of the relevant EU Directive (for more details with respect to the public country-by-country report and reporting deadlines, please refer to the Outlook section below).\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n- In September 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on a framework for an EU-wide windfall tax on profits for fossil fuel companies. The Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 introduced a solidarity contribution that was transposed into the local legislation of the Member States by the end of 2022 and applies to 2022 and/or 2023. It represents a contribution of surplus profits of companies operating in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, and refinery sectors and is intended to fund relief measures for households and businesses facing high energy prices.\n- With the eco-social tax reform having been adopted in Austria, a national CO2 emissions price was implemented in October 2022. The national CO2 emissions price applies to defined energy carriers according to defined emissions factors. As an energy provider, OMV will be charged a fixed CO2 emissions price that will be increased annually until 2026, before a market-based system is put in place. Generally, OMV supports the creation of such economic and socio-political incentives for more climatefriendly behavior; however, we favor the creation of a harmonized, EU-wide system.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nTaxation as a key steering instrument toward an ecofriendly, green economy is playing a major role in the current initiatives of the EU, OECD member states, and the Austrian government.\n\n- In 2021, the members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreed to reform international tax rules by implementing new rules for profit allocation (Pillar One) and establishing a global minimum taxation regime (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the Council of the European Union reached a unanimous agreement to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This Directive (2022/2523) aims to ensure that large groups operating in the EU are taxed at a minimum global effective tax rate of 15% in each country in which those groups have business activities. Member States were obligated to transpose these rules into domestic law by December 31, 2023, and the rules are effective from January 1, 2024.\n- In 2021, the European Council, European Parliament, and European Commission reached an agreement on the proposed Public Country-by-Country reporting (CbCR) Directive. Member States were obligated to transpose the Directive into national law by June 2023 and the first reportable year is 2025, with a reporting deadline of the end of 2026.\n- In December 2022, the European Commission proposed the VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) reforms to amend the European Union (EU) Value Added Tax (VAT) system in response to the challenges of digitalization. The mandatory e-invoicing, which should be implemented by January 2028, should help to close the VAT gap. Many other states (e.g., Germany, Romania, etc.) are currently planning to introduce or have already introduced local e-invoicing/ reporting requirements that should also strengthen the VAT base and make tax a driver for innovation and growth due to the elimination of manual tasks and automation of invoice processing.\n- Currently, only some countries in the EU have adopted a national CO2 emissions price for transport and buildings. In 2023, a new emissions trading system was created by the European Commission. The EU-wide Emissions Trading System 2 (ETS 2), covering fuel combustion in buildings, road transport, and additional sectors, is a crucial part of the EU's Fit for 55 package. It will put an absolute cap on emissions, which will decrease in line with a linear reduction factor. Allowances will be distributed exclusively via auctioning. The ETS 2 will be launched by 2027 or 2028, with monitoring and reporting obligations already starting in 2025.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons.

In the first case, a fine of EUR 10,000 was paid because of soil pollution occurring from the failure of a salt water transport pipeline functioning effectively in the Argeș District. In the second case, a fine of EUR 15,000 was paid because of gas and dust emissions affecting the air quality at the Petrobrazi refinery, in the Prahova District. In 2023, OMV Petrom began a general turnaround at the Petrobrazi refinery, which also included maintenance work and more than 20 modernization projects.\n\n<sup>4</sup> The third case is related to Borealis Kallo NV for violating the controlling rights of a public officer supervising environmental policy law. The case was appealed but lost and a total fine of EUR 16,422.11 was issued. Borealis Kallo NV is still to receive a payment request that will give the required information in order to proceed with the payment of this fine.\n\n<sup>5</sup> Four out of the five incidents were associated with various occurrences of non-compliance at OMV Petrom S.A. and OMV Petrom Marketing SRL. Significant fines were issued for two cases against OMV Petrom S.A. for breaching legal provisions on consumer protection and for failure to comply with the measures imposed by ANRE within the set deadline. The fines issued for the remaining two cases against OMV Petrom Marketing SRL were minor (total: EUR 2,600), however, the authority ordered the suspension of the activity at the gas station Târgu Bujor, for a month, and for 16 gas stations the authority ordered the loss of validity of the prevention against fires permit.\n\n<sup>6</sup> Included in this figure is a critical case in Romania, where in 2016, a child drowned in a pit filled with oil from an extraction well, which was not fenced. In December 2022, related to this, OMV Petrom S.A. was found guilty of manslaughter by the Găeşti District Court and was ordered to pay a criminal fine amounting to RON 28,000 (approx. EUR 5,700). On the civil side, the court assessed the degree of fault of OMV Petrom S.A. at 50%, and the company was obliged to pay moral damages of EUR 135,000 to the victim's family and material damages and other expenses in the total amount of RON 22,000 (approx. EUR 4,500). In 2023, OMV Petrom S.A. was found guilty and convicted for committing the crime of involuntary manslaughter. A total fine of EUR 100,000 was imposed by the Ploiești Court of Appeal, Prahova District, of which EUR 40,000 was paid to the civil parties and EUR 3,000 was paid as judicial expenses. Since the case occurred in 2016, OMV Petrom S.A. has ramped up its efforts to identify and secure the areas surrounding the wells and to apply relevant precautionary measures, e.g., fencing the areas around the well, installing grills above the well, and placing clear warning signs.\n\nn.r. = not reported\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons.

We use emission factors from different sources, e.g., IPCC, PlasticsEurope, DBEIS, etc. The data includes Scope 3 emissions from the use and processing of sold products. Pure \"trading margin\" sales as well as intracompany sales are excluded. Since 2015, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods are included. Since 2018, net import of refinery feedstock is included.\n\n<sup>6</sup> Borealis Scope 3 category 15 emissions are accounted for as 19.9 mn t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent, but not yet included in OMV's Group consolidation.\n\n<sup>7</sup> 2022 data restated to reflect additional feedstock amounts that had previously not been included\n\nn.r. = not reported\n\n## GHG Emissions – Targets 2030<sup>1</sup>\n\n|                                            | Unit                | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2019 (baseline) |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|\n| Total GHG direct, Scope 1                  | mn t CO2 equivalent | 9.3   | 10.0  | 11.6  | 12.4            |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 6.5   | 7.2   | 8.4   | 9.2             |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 2.8   | 2.7   | 3.2   | 3.1             |\n| Total GHG indirect, Scope 2                | mn t CO2 equivalent | 1.0   | 0.8   | 0.9   | 1.3             |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 0.2   | 0.2   | 0.2   | 0.3             |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 0.8   | 0.6   | 0.7   | 0.9             |\n| Total GHG indirect, Scope 32               | mn t CO2 equivalent | 103.2 | 106.4 | 118.1 | 114.5           |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 87.4  | 90.0  | 100.2 | 96.5            |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 15.9  | 16.3  | 17.8  | 18.1            |\n| Carbon intensity of energy supply3         | g CO2/MJ            | 69.1  | 67.5  | 67.4  | 69.8            |\n| Methane intensity4                         | %                   | 0.3   | 0.4   | 0.6   | 1.3             |\n\n<sup>1</sup> For the purpose of setting GHG emissions reduction targets, a meaningful and consistent comparison over time requires the setting of a performance date (base year) with which to compare current emissions. For its 2030 and 2040 GHG reduction targets, the OMV Group has set 2019 as the base year including full-year Scope 1 to 3 emissions data of Borealis. In accordance with best practice guidance (i.e., GHG Protocol), when a company undergoes significant structural changes due to acquisitions, divestments, and mergers, GHG data shall be recalculated for all years dating back to the base year. OMV has set a threshold that a significant change means that the cumulative effect of mergers/acquisitions/divestments represents a higher effect than 5% on the OMV Group's base year absolute GHG emissions. Accordingly, this table shows the recalculated emissions for the categories of emissions relevant for the 2030 targets. The previous table, GHG Emissions – Absolute, does not have recalculated data to give as transparent a picture as possible.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The following Scope 3 categories are included: Category 11: Use of Sold Products for OMV's energy segment, Category 1: Purchased Goods (feedstocks) from OMV's non-energy business segment, and Category 12: End-of-Life of Sold Products for OMV's non-energy segment.\n\n<sup>3</sup> The carbon intensity of energy supply is measured by assessing the intensity of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions plus Scope 3 emissions (in g CO2) from the use of sold energy products, against the total energy value of all externally sold energy products (in MJ) (excluding purely traded volumes).\n\n<sup>4</sup> The methane intensity refers to the volume of methane emissions from OMV's operated E&P oil and gas assets as a percentage of the volume of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. The approach is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI) methane intensity. Unlike the other figures in this table, the methane intensity is not subject to a baseline recalculation, as the target is a fixed value and the target achievement is not compared to the base year. In case of mergers and aquisitions, new operations will be expected to endorse the existing target.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n## GHG Emissions – Targets 2025<sup>1</sup>\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Unit                                 | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020   | 2019 | 2010 (baseline) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| GHG intensity of operations                                                                                            | OMV Group Carbon<br>Intensity Index2 | 80      | 83      | 82      | 82     | 80   | 100             |\n| Reduction achieved vs. 2010                                                                                            | %                                    | 20      | 17      | 18      | 18     | 20   | n.a.            |\n| GHG intensity of product portfolio                                                                                     | mn t GHG per mn t oil<br>equivalent  | 2.6     | 2.6     | 2.5     | 2.5    | 2.5  | 2.6             |\n| Achieve at least 1 mn t of CO2<br>reductions in<br>2020–2025 from operated assets (cumulative<br>reductions) (Scope 1) | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 703,146 | 644,946 | 532,907 | 77,900 | n.a. | n.a.            |\n| thereof from concrete reduction initiatives                                                                            | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 327,612 | 269,412 | 157,374 | 77,900 | n.a. | n.a.            |\n| thereof from divestments                                                                                               | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 375,534 | 375,533 | 375,533 | 0.0    | n.a. | n.a.            |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Excluding Borealis\n\n<sup>2</sup> Direct CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent emissions produced to generate a certain business output using the following business-specific metric – Upstream: t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent/toe produced, refineries: t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent/t throughput (crude and semi-finished products without blended volumes), power: t CO2 equivalent/MWh produced – consolidated into an OMV Group Carbon Intensity Index, based on weighted average of the business segments' carbon intensity.

Production was disrupted during the whole of 2023. Subsequently, ongoing projects have been paused and activities in the field reduced to maintenance, inspection, and preservation operations. This is reflected in the significant decrease observed in the routine flaring value.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons.

Additionally,<br>equipment to protect against the<br>hazard (e.g., PPE kits, on-site fire<br>department, etc.), safety manuals,<br>and signs are also made available. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                    |\n| 403-10      | Work-related ill health                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Requirement omitted:<br>403-10-a-i, ii, iii, 403-10-b-i, ii, iii,<br>403-10-c-i,ii,iii, 403-10-d, 403-10-e<br>Reason: Legal prohibitions<br>Explanation: In most of the countries<br>where OMV operates, the legal<br>definition of an \"occupational health<br>illness\" varies widely (Health is<br>excluded from the EU Maastricht<br>Treaty).

This is because we assign<br>target groups to training courses based<br>on risks, taking into consideration<br>affiliation to a certain business unit or<br>the type of activities performed rather<br>than specific regions or employee<br>categories. Due to the set-up of the<br>training courses over two-year cycles,<br>there is currently no plan to disclose this<br>in the foreseeable future. | 11.20.3

The 2023 Report describes our management and performance of the material Environmental, Social, and Governance issues for the OMV Group. This Report covers the operations of the OMV Group, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, for the 2023 business year.\n\nThis Report is the combined, consolidated, non-financial report of the OMV Group in line with the Austrian Nachhaltigkeits- und Diversitätsverbesserungsgesetz (Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act; NaDiVeG), namely in accordance with Section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code. In line with NaDiVeG's reporting requirements (Section 243b), data particularly relevant for OMV Aktiengesellschaft is reported separately in the Performance in Detail section under OMV AG Data.\n\nOMV's 2023 Sustainability Report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, applying the GRI Oil and Gas Sector Standard 2021. The Report is also guided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production industry, the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the \"Sustainability reporting guidance for the oil and gas industry\" developed by Ipieca, API, and IOGP. Reporting on OMV's alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been informed by the Business Reporting on the SDGs published by the GRI and the UN Global Compact (UNGC). The document also serves as our Communication on Progress for the UNGC.\n\n## Report Scope and Boundaries\n\nThe data presented in the Report is consolidated at Group level and covers all fully consolidated entities, analogous to the Company's financial statements. This boundary applies to all material topics, unless clearly indicated otherwise for a particular material topic in the text of this Sustainability Report. Where an entity is not included in the reporting, it is denoted in a footnote. All of the Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) data, including greenhouse gas (GHG) data for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions, is collected for activities where OMV is the operator or where OMV has a stake of more than 50% and exerts a controlling influence (operational approach).<sup>1</sup> Where data has been restated due to changes in calculation methodology or error, this has been denoted in a footnote.\n\n## Assurance and Approval\n\nThe Sustainability Report is approved by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the OMV Group. OMV's Sustainability Report 2023 was subject to independent and external limited assurance by KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, and was discussed extensively by the Audit Committee, the Sustainability & Transformation Committee, and the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board found no issues during the audit and are responsible for the final approval of this Report. The independent assurance (limited assurance) was performed in accordance with the requirements of the ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard issued by the International Federation of Accountants, and in conformity with Austrian Standards for Independent Assurance Engagements (KFS/PG 13). More information about OMV can be found in the [OMV Annual Report 2023](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023), in the [OMV Factbook,](https://www.omv.com/en/investor-relations/publications#factbook) and on our website: [www.omv.com](https://www.omv.com/en)\n\nFor Scope 3 categories 10, 11, and 12, the operational control approach is applied. For example, in OMV's Energy division, when an OMV Group company participates in joint operations, and is fully consolidated, 100% of the respective OMV Group company sales are accounted, however, this value usually only represents the OMV Group's share in the joint operation. 1\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Sustainability at OMV\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **Foreword**\n- **Highlights 2023**\n- **OMV at a Glance**\n- **Sustainability Framework**\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/1 description: The image shows three circular icons.

What did you mean by that?**\n\nThe European Union (EU) Green Deal recognizes that there is no single solution to addressing climate change. To achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a substantial collective effort will be required from every sector. Our strategy acknowledges this interconnectedness and interdependency. We therefore aim to re-invent essentials for sustainable living, not only in a way that aligns with our targets, but also that delivers comparable benefits to our stakeholders. This is the systematic change I was referring to – we all have our role to play on this journey. For transformative change to occur in our society, collaboration, technology, and innovation will be crucial.\n\nIn 2023, OMV continued to form strategic partnerships and alliances. For instance, we partnered with Interzero to build one of Europe's largest waste sorting plants. It will provide circular and sustainable feedstock for chemical recycling using our patented ReOil® technology. The feedstock produced will then be transformed into a high-quality raw material that is certified according to the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification, or ISCC. Customers who utilize this raw material as feedstock for sustainable plastic production will gain improved insights into the carbon footprint of the products they make. To ensure that our patented technology also benefits other stakeholders, we signed a mutually exclusive collaboration agreement with Wood for its commercial licensing on a global scale. The licensees will also benefit from full asset life cycle support.\n\n### **Can you comment on some of the measures OMV is implementing to actively reduce its direct and indirect emissions, especially the challenging Scope 3 emissions?**\n\nTo actively reduce our direct emissions at ongoing operations in Austria and Romania, we have started using renewable energy generated by our solar parks. For instance, the PV plants located at the Lobau tank farm and Schönkirchen together generated more than 20 GWh of renewable energy in 2023, which was used for our ongoing operations.\n\nTo reduce our Scope 2 emissions, we signed several power purchase agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy supply for many years to come. As an example, the clean wind energy acquired through the PPA with WEB Windenergie AG will be used to produce green hydrogen at the Schwechat refinery. Through the projects we have implemented, we have been able to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% and the carbon intensity of our operations by 20% compared with the base year 2019.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/12 description: A portrait of a man in a suit and tie. He has gray hair and a beard, and he is wearing glasses. He is standing in front of a white background. He is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a blue tie. There is a small pin on his lapel.\n\n## \"Prioritizing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and stakeholders will always be paramount for us.\"\n\nReducing Scope 3 emissions is a key challenge for many sectors, underscoring the need for holistic solutions. For instance, to address Scope 3.11 emissions linked to the sustainable feedstock we supply, we have initiated Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs offer insights into a product's CO2 emissions and guide optimization measures to achieve further reductions. For example, the LCA we commissioned for our ReOil® technology demonstrated\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/1 description: This image contains text describing the advantages of the circular economy. By 2030, 34% of CO2e emissions could be saved if waste streams currently destined for incineration are chemically recycled using the ReOil technology.\n\nThese are only a few examples of the projects have been implemented. Individually, the annual CO2 savings they achieve may not seem significant at first glance, but when combined, they present a different picture. We have also made significant investments to reduce the carbon footprint of our portfolio. In 2023, OMV and Wien Energie formed a joint venture called \"deeep\" to work on decarbonizing district heating in Vienna by providing geothermal energy as an alternative. In Romania, OMV Petrom and Complexul Energetic Oltenia joined forces to build four PV parks with a combined capacity of 450 MW. They will supply electricity to the national grid from 2025. In Norway, with our partner Aker BP, we completed the acquisition of a 3D seismic survey of the Poseidon CCS license area. Our collaborations with start-ups, universities, and technology leaders around the world thrived, emphasizing our pursuit of innovative solutions to reduce emissions and advance sustainable energy development.\n\n#### **In 2021, OMV made a commitment to the Just Transition. What progress has been made so far?**\n\nIntegrating climate change and the Just Transition into our Group's Human Rights Policy Statement was the first essential step. We simultaneously prioritized training for our employees, ensuring they are well-prepared for future job roles that emerge as a result of our strategy. To enable our workforce to cultivate a mindset aligned with our journey to net zero, we also introduced the Sustainability Academy. It provides an essential foundation for various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics, the circular economy, low-carbon technologies, and others. More specialized training was offered to employees already involved in implementing our strategy. For instance, employees that were previously working in the exploration department in our Energy segment were upskilled to equip them with the specific skill set necessary for developing geothermal reservoirs.\n\nIn 2023, we spent more than EUR 12 mn on training employees and I am proud to say that we have already achieved our 2030 target of increasing the average number of annual learning hours to at least 30 hours per employee.\n\n### **Health & Safety has always been an important topic for you. Unfortunately, the incidents and injuries reported have seen a rise over the past two years.**\n\nIt is always disheartening to witness a reversing trend. No matter how many impressive results we achieve, if it is at the expense of our employee and contractors' well-being, this can only imply a collective failure to meet our HSSE\n\nVision of being \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\"\n\nPrioritizing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and stakeholders will always be paramount for us. We are actively reassessing our safety measures and have a renewed commitment to implementing effective strategies to slow and reverse this trend. Initiatives like \"We CARE,\" \"BACK to BASICS,\" and \"B-SAFE\" across different parts of the Group have begun to yield positive results. With our updated HSSE strategy and a strong focus on safety culture, leadership, and contractor engagement, I am convinced that we will successfully resume our journey toward becoming an industry leader in safety.\n\n### **Mr. Stern, this is a very special edition of OMV's Sustainability Report. How would you describe OMV's sustainability journey over the past few years and what are your thoughts on the new reporting framework?**\n\nYes, this truly is a momentous occasion because it is the last stand-alone edition of our Sustainability Report. In recent years, our sustainability journey has demonstrated continuous improvement. In the last two years alone, we pinpointed numerous data and reporting gaps, achieving an impressive 25% improvement in disclosed data points between 2021 and 2022. This not only underscores our commitment to comprehensive and transparent reporting practices but also signifies the positioning of sustainability at the heart of our strategy.\n\nOur Sustainability Report has always catered to numerous stakeholder groups and provided substantial information that goes beyond what is typically included in the financial statement. The key challenge in the coming years will be to ensure that we strike a healthy balance between financial and non-financial reporting. The combined report should not merely become a reporting exercise but rather a tool that aids the assessment for positive transformation and to drive continuous improvement. Finally, the combined report will provide an excellent framework to balance our social responsibility on the one hand, and maintain our focus on delivering excellent financial performance on the other.\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and by extension the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, elevate sustainability to a level of prominence that has traditionally been reserved for finance. The clear emphasis is on a dual imperative – while businesses must pursue profitability, they are equally obligated to ensure that the adopted business practices reflect their social responsibilities as well. This highlights a paradigm shift toward a more balanced and responsible approach to OMV's success. I firmly believe that transformation and growth can only be achieved by embracing change and am looking forward to the further integration of sustainability into our business.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles.

The Company supplies services and products to customers worldwide through OMV and Borealis<sup>2</sup>, and its two joint ventures: Borouge (with\n\nADNOC, based in the UAE and Singapore) and Baystar™ (with TotalEnergies, based in the US).\n\nIn Fuels & Feedstock, OMV operates three refineries in Europe: Schwechat (Austria) and Burghausen (Germany), both of which feature integrated petrochemical production, and the Petrobrazi refinery (Romania). In addition, OMV holds a 15% share in ADNOC Refining and in ADNOC Global Trading in the UAE. OMV's total global processing capacity amounts to around 500 kbbl/d. Fuels and other sales volumes in Europe were 16.3 mn t in 2023 (2022: 15.5 mn t) and the retail network consisted at the end of 2023 of 1,666 filling stations (2022: 1,803) in eight European countries.\n\nIn Energy, OMV explores, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas in its three core regions of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the North Sea. OMV is currently in the process of divesting its E&P assets in the Asia-Pacific region.<sup>3</sup> Its activities also include the low carbon business and the entire gas business. Daily hydrocarbon production was 364 kboe/d in 2023 (2022: 392 kboe/d), with a nearly equal share of liquids and natural gas production. In the Gas Marketing & Power business, OMV markets and trades natural gas and power in several European countries, which also includes its LNG business. It holds a 65% stake in the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) and operates natural gas storage facilities with a capacity of around 30 TWh in Austria and Germany, and a gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\nOMV announced in July 2023 that it had decided to pursue negotiations with ADNOC on a potential cooperation regarding their polyolefins businesses. Such cooperation would include a potential combination of the Borealis and Borouge businesses as equal partners under a jointly controlled, listed platform for potential growth acquisitions to create a global polyolefins company with a material presence in key markets. 2\n\n<sup>3</sup> On January 31, 2024, OMV signed an agreement to divest its 50% shareholding in Malaysia's SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd. to TotalEnergies for an overall cash consideration of USD 903 mn. The divestment is anticipated to close around the end of the first half of 2024, and is in particular subject to regulatory approvals. The sales process for 100% of the shares in OMV New Zealand will continue separately.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

It encourages increased channeling of investments by companies, investors, and policymakers to where they are most needed for sustainable development. Therefore, the EU Taxonomy Regulation will play an important role in scaling up sustainable investments and implementing the European Green Deal.\n\nOMV has been a member of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, the permanent expert group of the European Commission that was established under Article 20 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, since October 2022 and has assisted the Commission in developing its sustainable finance policies, notably the further development of the EU taxonomy.\n\nFor the OMV Group, the EU taxonomy provides a means to assess which of our current and future economic activities can be classed as environmentally sustainable. According to the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity identified in this category must make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU's environmental objectives, in addition to not significantly harming any of the objectives and meeting the defined minimum social safeguards. The six relevant environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation are:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nIn June 2021, the Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act, establishing the criteria that define which activities substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the first two out of the six environmental objectives. The disclosure requirements were effective for reports published since January 1, 2022, in relation to the aforementioned climate change objectives. In 2022, the Complementary Climate Delegated Act was released, which extends the EU taxonomy framework to\n\npermit certain economic activities involving gas and nuclear energy to be classified as \"environmentally sustainable\" and came into effect on January 1, 2023. The EU taxonomy for the four remaining environmental objectives and the amendments to the Annexes of the Disclosures Delegated Act were published in June 2023 by the European Commission.\n\n## OMV's Process for Identifying and Assessing EU Taxonomy Activities\n\n#### **EU Taxonomy Eligibility Assessment**\n\nAn economic activity is considered to be taxonomy-eligible if it matches the description of the activity given in the EU taxonomy. In order to identify eligible activities/products at OMV, we performed a screening of the full portfolio of OMV activities and compared our activities to the description of the economic activities/products listed in Annex I or II of the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and Annex I–IV of the EU Taxonomy Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nThe assessment of eligible activities and products at OMV is carried out by an interdisciplinary project team, using both a bottom-up and a top-down approach. A series of internal meetings and training sessions with management and experts was held in order to give OMV businesses an introduction to the new EU taxonomy and disclosure requirements. A further series of workshops was held with all business segments and corporate entities to ensure the bottom-up identification of eligible activities, assets, processes, and related eligible CAPEX/OPEX/turnover. OMV's identified EU taxonomy-eligible economic activities are mainly related to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, and one activity is related to the environmental objective of the transition to a circular economy. Analysis of all our economic activities is done on an annual basis and includes an update of the previous year's assessment.\n\n#### **EU Taxonomy Alignment Assessment**\n\nIn 2022, OMV carried out an alignment assessment based on the EU taxonomy criteria and this was updated over the course of 2023. The assessment had the purpose of identifying whether any newly identified eligible activities fulfilled the criteria for substantial contribution to the climate mitigation objective or climate adaption environmental objective, the do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria of the other environmental objectives, and the minimum social safeguards criteria. Note that no comparison figures are available for the four additional environmental goals for the reporting year 2022. The economic activities that OMV identified as aligning with the EU taxonomy are all related to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation. The alignment assessment of OMV's eligible activities according to the EU Taxonomy Environmental Delegated\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nAct will be done in line with the legal requirements as of next year.\n\nResponsibility for the alignment checks and evidence gathering was clearly defined in the OMV Group's EU Taxonomy Guidance. The project/asset managers for the respective eligible project/activity were responsible for assessing compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution and the respective DNSH criteria. Support was provided by the OMV Group Sustainability team and sustainability experts from OMV Petrom and Borealis. The required physical climate risk and vulnerability assessments to comply with the DNSH climate change adaptation criteria were performed centrally by OMV Group Sustainability in conjunction with Corporate Risk Management, and with the support of an external provider in line with the OMV Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management approach.\n\nIn general, the main taxonomy-eligible business activities for OMV relate to activity \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\", activity \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" and activity \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids\". More detailed information can be found in the respective KPI section (Turnover, CAPEX, OPEX).\n\nThe assessment of compliance with the minimum social safeguards and governance criteria was performed by OMV Group Sustainability by assessing whether the clauses in relevant OMV policies (Human Rights Policy, Code of Conduct, Code of Business Ethics, Tax Strategy) are in line with the international standards referred to in the EU taxonomy. It was further assessed whether OMV's human rights management system and its related processes (e.g., grievance mechanisms, community consultation) are established in line with these international standards. The detailed assessment showed no gaps between the OMV Group's approach to human rights policies, addressing of impacts, due diligence and risk assessment procedures, communication, grievance mechanisms, consumer interests, anti-corruption, competition, or taxation and the social safeguard requirements laid out in the EU taxonomy. For more details on the unadjusted gender pay gap and the Board gender diversity, please refer to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion chapter, and Workforce Data.\n\nNo relevant final liability regarding breaches of the minimum safeguards have been identified at OMV in recent years, including breach of labor law or human rights, breach of corruption or competition laws, or breach of tax laws.\n\n#### **Definition of Financial KPIs**\n\nOMV's values for the KPIs are derived from the figures reported in the Group's consolidated IFRS financial statements.\n\nThe KPIs are calculated based on the sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX of all fully consolidated subsidiaries of the OMV Group. Subsidiaries that are not consolidated, associated companies, and joint ventures were excluded from the calculation of KPIs as per the reporting requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in the sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX (the \"alignment ratio\") has been calculated as the part of sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX derived from products and services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by the total sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX (denominator). The same logic applies to the calculation of the \"eligibility ratio.\"\n\nThe denominators for the financial KPIs were defined and can be reconciled with the IFRS Group financial statements as follows:\n\n- The denominator of the turnover KPI is based on OMV's consolidated sales revenues [\\(OMV Consoli](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/6-sales-revenues)[dated Financial Statements 2023, Note 6](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/6-sales-revenues) ). For further details on our accounting policies regarding consolidated sales revenues, see [OMV Consolidated Finan](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion2)[cial Statements 2023, Note 3.2b.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion2)\n- The denominator for the CAPEX KPI consists of additions to intangible assets (including oil and gas properties with unproved reserves), tangible assets, and IFRS 16 right-of-use assets (see OMV Consolidated Financial Statements 2022, [Notes 16](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-statement-of-financial-position/16-intangible-assets.html) and [17](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-statement-of-financial-position/17-property-plant-and-equipment.html)). Additions from business combinations are included in the denominator, except for additions to goodwill. Decommissioning assets are not included in the denominator. Additions included in the denominator deviate from additions according to the IFRS Group financial statements because government grants are not considered in the denominator while the net presentation option is applied for the IFRS Group financial statements. For further details on our accounting policies regarding the relevant assets, see [OMV Consolidated Financial Statements 2023, Notes](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion7) [3.2g, h, and p.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/3-accounting-policies-judgements-and-estimates#accordion7)\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nTotal OPEX consists of R&D expenses, maintenance and repair costs, other direct expenditure related to day-to-day servicing of assets, and short-term leases. R&D expenses include the research and development expenses recognized according to IAS 38 and reported in the line \"Other operating expenses\" in the income statement (see [OMV Consoli](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/10-other-operating-expenses)[dated Financial Statements 2023, Note 10](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-income-statement/10-other-operating-expenses) ). Maintenance and repair costs and other direct expenditure related to dayto-day servicing of assets mainly include costs for external services, personnel expenses, and material costs related to regular and unplanned maintenance, repairs, and servicing measures. The related cost items can be found in the line items \"Production and operating expenses\" and \"Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses\" in the income statement. Expenses for short-term leases have been determined and included in line with IFRS 16. Direct costs for training and other human resources improvement needs are immaterial and therefore excluded from the denominator and the numerator.\n\nFor most of the activities, sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX for aligned and eligible activities could be allocated directly to individual activities listed in the taxonomy based on data available in the Group entities' ERP systems. This ensured that there was no double counting of aligned or eligible sales revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX. In the refineries, CAPEX for assets used for the joint production of organic basic chemicals and fuels has been allocated to the taxonomy-eligible activity \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals.\" Also, this has been allocated to non-eligible activities using an allocation key reflecting the yield, size, and complexity of the different refinery plants used for this purpose. The same approach was used for repair and maintenance expenses for cost centers, which are involved in the production of organic basic chemicals and fuels.\n\nThe method of calculating the KPIs was changed in 2023 to fully implement the guidance published by the European Commission in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).<sup>4</sup> Grants deducted from CAPEX in the financial statements are now excluded from the CAPEX KPI in the numerator and denominator. In addition, turnover, CAPEX, and OPEX from assets held for sale (IFRS 5) have been included since January 1, 2023, in the calculation of all three KPIs. Prior-year KPIs were not adjusted. The impact of these changes would have been immaterial. Total government grants related to assets and deducted from CAPEX in 2022 amounted to EUR 5.4 mn. Total sales revenues related to IFRS 5 disposal groups amounted to EUR 3,838.1 mn in 2022 and were mainly associated with the nitrogen division at Borealis and the retail business in Slovenia. Total CAPEX related to IFRS 5 disposal groups amounted to EUR 5.9 mn.\n\n|                                                           |        | Turnover |        | CAPEX |        | OPEX |  | 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------|------|--|------|\n|                                                           | EUR mn | %        | EUR mn | %     | EUR mn | %    |  |      |\n| Environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned) activities | 69     | 0.2      | 415    | 10.5  | 3      | 0.3  |  |      |\n| Taxonomy-eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned activities    | 7,135  | 18.1     | 1,096  | 27.7  | 347    | 42.1 |  |      |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities                          | 32,259 | 81.7     | 2,441  | 61.8  | 474    | 57.5 |  |      |\n| Total                                                     | 39,463 |          | 3,952  |       | 824    |      |  |      |\n\n|                                                              |               |          |              |       |            | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|-------|------------|------|\n|                                                              |               | Turnover |              | CAPEX |            | OPEX |\n|                                                              | EUR mn        | %        | EUR mn       | %     | EUR mn     | %    |\n| Environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned)<br>activities | 37            | 0.1      | 347          | 9.5   | 0          | 0.0  |\n| Taxonomy-eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned<br>activities    | 10,398        | 17.8     | 1,252        | 34.2  | 321        | 41.1 |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities                             | 48,025        | 82.1     | 2,060        | 56.3  | 458        | 58.8 |\n| <b>Total</b>                                                 | <b>58,460</b> |          | <b>3,659</b> |       | <b>779</b> |      |\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Eligible and Taxonomy-Aligned Turnover**\n\nIn 2023, 18.1% (2022: 17.8%) of OMV's total turnover was classified as taxonomy-eligible (non-aligned), while 0.2% (2022: 0.1%) of OMV's total turnover was classified as taxonomy-aligned. In 2023, all taxonomy-eligible/aligned turnover was related to the objective of climate change mitigation.\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Eligible Turnover 2023**\n\nThe eligible turnover arose from activities \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" which reflects the activities of our C&M segment (e.g., production of polyolefins), and \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals,\" also coming from the C&M segment (e.g., production of ethylene and propylene), as well as activity\n\nEU Commission: [Commission Notice](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C_202300305) on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (second Commission Notice), C/2023/305, October 20, 2023 4\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in a row.

Furthermore, the activities \"4.30 Highefficiency co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous fuels\" and \"5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste\" contributed to the taxonomy-eligible turnover.\n\nThe majority of aligned turnover in 2023 was derived from the activity \"4.25 Production of heat/cool using waste heat,\" which reflects the waste heat supplies from the Schwechat refinery. Another contribution arose from activity \"3.17 Manufacture of plastics in primary form,\" with Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH processing postconsumer plastics and turning them into high-quality LDPE recyclates. Further minor contributions to aligned turnover resulted from the activity \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids,\" which covers the sales of sustainable aviation fuels, as well as from the activity \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport,\" which covers hydrogen sales for mobility purposes.\n\nElectricity produced from renewables, such as the generation of electricity using solar photovoltaic technology and wind power, is used for internal consumption only.\n\nThe split of aligned and eligible turnover between revenue from contracts with customers and revenue within the scope of IFRS 9 is included in the following table. Eligible revenue from transactions within the scope of IFRS 9 includes power sales from the gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\n#### **Taxonomy-Aligned Turnover 2023**\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/7 description: The image is a donut chart showing the percentages of different categories. 81.7% is non-eligible (2022: 82.1%), 0.2% is aligned (2022: <0.1%), 18.1% is non-aligned (2022: 17.8%), and 18.3% is eligible (2022: 17.9%).

Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment.\" Under the circular economy objective, the activity \"2.7 Sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous waste\" can be reported, reflecting OMV's joint venture with Interzero to build and operate Europe's largest sorting facility for chemical recycling. In 2023, CAPEX of EUR 107.4 mn was related to business combinations (2022: nil), of which EUR 28.1 mn was related to intangible assets and EUR 79.3 mn to tangible assets.\n\nThe largest contributors to aligned CAPEX were activities \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals,\" which reflects our investment in Borealis' propane dehydrogenation unit 2 (PDH2) in Kallo, and \"9.1 Close to market research, development, and innovation,\" which stems from the investment in the ReOil® 2000 chemical recycling demonstration plant at the Schwechat refinery. Other contributors to taxonomy-aligned CAPEX were the following activities: \"3.10 Manufacture of hydrogen\" (e.g., UpHy project), \"4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\" (e.g., PV plant in Arbesthal, PV plant in Würmlach), \"4.3 Electricity generation from wind power\" (e.g., Gullfaks Hywind Tampen project), \"4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity\" (e.g., renewable electricity transmission line to Edvard Grieg field), \"4.13 Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids\" (e.g., production facilities for sustainable aviation fuels and Glycerin to Propanol activities at the Schwechat refinery), \"4.25 Production of heat/cool using waste heat\" (e.g., district heating hub at the Schwechat refinery), \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport\" (e.g., hydrogen filling stations, electric charging points), and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies\" (e.g., installation of PV panels and heat pumps).\n\nThe rise in total aligned CAPEX in 2023 in comparison to 2022 is mainly due to the turnaround of the Petrobrazi refinery, the new aromatic complex project being executed and shown under the activities \"3.14 Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\" and \"6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport,\" mainly reflecting electric vehicle (EV) charging station projects at various locations.\n\nAligned and eligible CAPEX can be disaggregated into additions to the different asset classes in the table below.

In order to achieve those targets, a significant amount of CAPEX will be allocated to low-carbon business projects and activities between now and 2030. Organic CAPEX growth will be\n\ndriven by investments in sustainable and low-carbon projects in all three business segments of OMV. For the period 2022–2030, around 40% of the average annual organic CAPEX of around EUR 3.5 bn will be low-carbon CAPEX. In total, OMV will invest EUR 13 bn in low-carbon business solutions between 2022 and 2030.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Sustainability and circularity lie at the center of our Group strategy. We aim to become a netzero business by 2050, accelerate the energy transition, and proactively expedite the transition from a linear to a circular economy. We build positive relationships with our employees, communities, suppliers, and other stakeholders, including by addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\nOur Sustainability Framework is built around the three pillars Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). We have made the following commitments, which lie at the heart of our Sustainability Framework, to propel our ESG journey:\n\n#### Environmental:\n\n- OMV continuously improves the carbon efficiency of its operations and product portfolio, is fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, and aims to become a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner.\n- OMV is fully committed to acting on responsible natural resources management and will proactively expedite the transition from a linear to a circular economy.\n- OMV aims to minimize environmental impacts by preventing water and soil pollution, reducing emissions, using natural resources efficiently, and avoiding biodiversity disruption.\n\n#### Social:\n\n- Health, safety, and security have the highest priority in all activities, and OMV is fully committed to proactive risk management to realize its HSSE Vision: \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\"\n- OMV is committed to building and retaining a talented expert team for international and integrated growth, and we embrace our difference(s) and use our diversity of thought and experience as a catalyst for growth and creativity.\n- OMV is committed to ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees, and has zero tolerance for discrimination and sexual and nonsexual harassment.\n- As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, OMV is fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and aims to contribute to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by pursuing a social investment strategy that addresses local needs and the SDGs.\n- OMV is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities, and addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\n#### Governance:\n\n- OMV strives to uphold equally high ethical standards at all locations, and aims to earn stakeholders' confidence by implementing a high standard of corporate governance and by maintaining high standards of transparency and predictability.\n- OMV is committed to implementing sustainable procurement, which means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the services and goods the Company intends to purchase.\n\nOur Strategy 2030 is underpinned by this Sustainability Framework, with all business decisions guided by our ambition to become a net-zero business. Within our Sustainability Framework, we have established five strategic focus areas: Climate Change; Natural Resources Management; Health, Safety, and Security; People; and Ethical Business Practices. For each of these focus areas, we have formulated concrete targets and actions to be achieved by 2030. These serve as OMV's contribution to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our sustainability ambitions, especially getting to net zero, can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. The Group has earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn for the purpose of achieving our emissions reduction targets.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue outlined icon of a house inside of a blue circle.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons.

The background color is blue.\n\nFurther details and definitions for each target can be found in the respective Focus Areas sections of the report.\n\n## Sustainability Governance\n\nSustainability topics are fully integrated into the overall governance structure of the Company. These topics have the same weight as any other business consideration and, following the Company's responsible approach to business, are integrated into the daily operation and management processes of the Company. For instance, sustainability criteria form part of the Capital Allocation Framework (see Climate Change). ESG due diligence is also part of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n### Governance Structure\n\nOMV has a two-tier governance structure. The Executive Board, composed of the CEO, CFO, Executive Vice President (EVP) Chemicals & Materials, EVP Fuels & Feedstock, and EVP Energy, is the highest managing body of the Company and is responsible for setting and implementing the Company strategy, including climate and other sustainability targets. The Executive Board holds meetings at least every two weeks to exchange information and issue decisions on all matters requiring plenary approval.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is OMV's highest governing body and consists of ten members elected at the Annual General Meeting (shareholders' representatives) and five members delegated by the Group's Works Council. All members elected at the Annual\n\nGeneral Meeting (AGM) have declared their independence from the Company (according to the definition given in the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance).\n\nThe Supervisory Board appoints members of the Executive Board, monitors and supervises its decisions, and advises the Executive Board on strategy development. The Supervisory Board also assesses the performance of the Executive Board, including on sustainability criteria. The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on a regular and ad hoc basis. The Supervisory Board appoints among its members qualified expert committees that support their decision-making process. A self-assessment of the Supervisory Board is performed on an annual basis with the support of an external consultant. The 2023 evaluation showed positive results overall, with several areas where improvement in the work of the Supervisory Board had been observed in comparison to the 2022 results. For instance, it was highlighted that sustainability criteria now have an increasing importance in discussions and their decisionmaking process.\n\nThe Chairman of OMV's Supervisory Board regularly receives external feedback on the OMV Group's strategy, for example through the Corporate Governance Roadshows he attends or at the Annual General Meeting, among others.\n\nOMV's management of sustainability issues is overseen and steered by several committees.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue outlined circle with a blue house icon inside.

The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle. All icons are blue.\n\n## Sustainability & Transformation Committee\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Sustainability & Transformation Committee meets on a quarterly basis to discuss and steer topics such as regulatory ESG requirements, which include non-financial reporting requirements, ESG-related capital market activities, ESG governance and steering, and critical concerns related to sustainability.<sup>5</sup> The committee has oversight of all of the Company's material sustainability topics (e.g., health, safety, and security, carbon emissions reduction, circular economy, etc.) and their related KPIs and targets, as well as overall transformation topics, such as cultural changes and establishing ESG competency.\n\nAt the meetings of the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Sustainability & Transformation Committee gives a report to the entire plenary on a quarterly basis. The Sustainability & Transformation Committee and the entire Supervisory Board review and approve the OMV Group Sustainability Report every year. OMV's Supervisory Board benefits from a training program to learn about relevant topics, including ESG-related fields of interest. In 2023, the content of the training program included an external presentation delivered by a researcher from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) on the key outcomes of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change, which took place during a Sustainability & Transformation Committee meeting.\n\nThe evaluation of the Sustainability & Transformation Committee conducted as part of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment highlighted strong development since its formation in 2022. For instance, the committee has been actively responsible for monitoring the progress made with regard to OMV's Sustainability Strategy. In 2023, the committee saw that improvements had been made in ensuring that the response to significant incidents related to health, safety, security, and the environment was timely and effective.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability initiatives. At the top is the Supervisory Board, which oversees the Sustainability & Transformation Committee, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Portfolio & Project Committee, and Presidential & Nomination Committee. The Executive Board, consisting of the CEO, CFO, EVP Chemicals & Materials, EVP Fuels & Feedstock, and EVP Energy, is below the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board oversees the Sustainability Coordination Forum, Sustainability Steering Committee, and Risk Committee. There are also Business and other Group functions, including the Leadership team. The Group functions responsible for sustainability focus areas are Group Sustainability, Group HSSE, People & Culture, Compliance, Procurement, and Strategy. Group Sustainability includes overall ESG management, sustainability reporting and ESG disclosure, climate and carbon management, social responsibility, human rights, governance, communities, and NGOs. Group HSSE includes health, safety, well-being, environment-related topics, security, emergency, and crisis resilience. People & Culture includes employees, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Compliance includes compliance with business ethics and anti-corruption policies. Procurement includes supplier compliance with sustainable supply chain requirements. Strategy includes the overall strategic direction of OMV. All of these functions are connected to a network of functional experts in the business units/countries and local management team with topic accountability, as well as the Sustainability Business Partner (C&M, F&F, Energy).\n\n\\* Decided by the Executive Board; still to be set up\n\n<sup>5</sup> Critical concerns are cases that have raised significant attention from key stakeholders, have validity (e.g., legal decisions, allegations with significant proof etc.,), are in OMV's direct operations or value chain, and that would constitute a violation of one of the ten principles of theUNGlobal Compact. In 2023, three such concerns were flagged and discussed by the Sustainability & Transformation Committee. These concerns included a fatality at the Petrobrazi refinery, climate litigation, and an update on the Borealis Kallo case.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

This committee is chaired by OMV's CFO and consists of senior managers with responsibility and ownership for material topics, as well as relevant business representatives responsible for implementing OMV's sustainability and transformation agenda. Its mandate is to coordinate the\n\ndevelopment of the sustainability agenda across the OMV Group, monitor progress on target achievement, propose measures in the event of deviations, discuss emerging business opportunities, and prepare sustainability topics to be discussed by the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The committee meets at least twelve times per year.\n\n| Sustainability Coordination Forum                    |                                                         |                                                    |                                                  |                                             |                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| CFO                                                  |                                                         |                                                    |                                                  |                                             |                                                    |\n| SVP Investor<br>Relations &<br>Sustainability        | Head of<br>Department<br>Group<br>Sustainability        | SVP HSSE                                           | SVP People &<br>Culture                          | SVP Low Carbon<br>Business                  | SVP Legal                                          |\n| SVP Internal<br>Audit &<br>Compliance                | SVP Chief<br>Procurement<br>Officer                     | SVP Strategy                                       | Director Sust. &<br>Public Affairs<br>(Borealis) | SVP Business &<br>Digital<br>Transformation | SVP<br>Communications                              |\n| Director<br>Communication<br>& Sust.

This includes oversight of all material topics described in this Report, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, human rights, safety, etc. At Group level, responsibility for driving OMV's sustainability agenda, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability department in Investor Relations & Sustainability, which is among the responsibilities of the CFO. The Group Sustainability department works across the business to determine gaps in sustainability performance, define expectations, conduct benchmarking, and develop best practices.\n\nThe Group Sustainability department works in close collaboration with the various Group functions that are responsible for implementing OMV's Sustainability Framework. Further details are disclosed in the Governance\n\ndescriptions of each material topic found throughout this Report.\n\nGroup functions continuously develop and steer the processes relevant to the implementation of activities relating to social and environmental performance, and propose an action plan to functional experts in related business units on the ground. The functional experts remain in continuous communication regarding progress on the planned implementation. Each Group function reports directly to the Executive Board on the relevant social and environmental issues in conjunction with the Group Sustainability department. This includes reporting on progress in the implementation of the Sustainability Framework on a quarterly basis, presenting important events with regard to the material topics, and submitting implementation plans for sustainability initiatives for approval.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n### Executive Remuneration\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the performance of the Executive Board, including on the implementation of the sustainability strategy. The Remuneration Committee is authorized to determine the Executive Board's remuneration, including the structure of the remuneration system and the actual target achievement. The Executive Board remuneration consists of fixed and variable remuneration elements. Selected employees at senior management level are also eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The variable remuneration – LTIP and the annual bonus – includes performance criteria related to the Company's sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) performance. Long-term shareholder and other stakeholder interests are reflected in the performance-related remuneration, which includes both long-term and shortterm elements.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board was approved at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June 2022 and was effective in 2023. It sets out GHG and ESG targets as forming part of the annual bonus and LTIP. 15% of the annual bonus depends on the achievement of the defined reduction of net absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. 20% of the LTIP is based on the achievement of ESG targets and includes the reduction of the net carbon intensity of energy supply. The GHG targets in the annual bonus (i.e., reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and the LTIP (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of energy supply) are clearly linked and directly derived from the OMV Group GHG emissions reduction targets for 2030 and the required reduction pathways up to 2030 compared to the base year 2019. This means the achievement of the GHG targets set out in the annual bonus and the LTIP requires OMV to implement the defined decarbonization pathway to achieve its 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets, which include the reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30%, the reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 20%, and the reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply by 20% – all compared to the base year, 2019.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has established an OMVspecific catalog of criteria derived from OMV's Strategy 2030, among which are strategic GHG emissions reduction KPIs that steer OMV's decarbonization actions up to 2030. These include the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and the reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee chooses the specific ESG targets and their weighting for each LTIP tranche based on this catalog. Within the ESG targets, GHG emissions reduction will always constitute a target in the LTIP. GHG and ESG targets and their weighting are published in the Remuneration Report for the grant year, which can be\n\nfound on the [OMV website.](https://www.omv.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/general-meeting/past-years) Based on predefined criteria (e.g., fatalities, TRIR, process safety – also in comparison to industry benchmarks), a health and safety malus of between 0.8 and 1.0 is applied to the overall target achievement for both the annual bonus and the LTIP. In the event of severe incidents, the Remuneration Committee may reduce the payout to zero. This malus considers OMV's commitment to health and workplace safety.\n\nAn external review of actual target achievement is performed by the Group's auditor, and the results are communicated to the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board.\n\n## Materiality\n\nOMV identifies material content for the Sustainability Report in an extensive and structured process of consultation with the Company's external and internal stakeholders.\n\nOMV last comprehensively updated its materiality analysis of sustainability topics in compliance with the legal requirements related to the disclosure of non-financial information in Austria (Nachhaltigkeits- und Diversitätsverbesserungsgesetz; NaDiVeG) and the GRI Standards in 2020. The detailed process used to determine the current list of material topics can be found in the [Sustainability](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2020/sustainability-at-omv/sustainability-framework/materiality-and-stakeholders.html) [Report 2020](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2020/sustainability-at-omv/sustainability-framework/materiality-and-stakeholders.html). Stakeholder interests, the significant external economic, environmental, and social impacts of OMV's business, as well as the financial materiality and business relevance of these topics to OMV were essential to this process. Impacts (both by OMV and on OMV, i.e., \"Inside-Out\" and \"Outside-In\") and the relevance to stakeholders were considered across the entire OMV value chain. We conducted this process together with an external party in order to maintain an objective and independent view on the material topics. The extensive materiality analysis involving internal and external stakeholders will be repeated every three years, or if significant changes in the business or market environment occur.\n\nWe reviewed the results of the materiality analysis again as part of our strategy update in late 2021. During this review, some material topics were split into two individual material topics: \"Climate Change and Energy Transition\" was split into \"Carbon Emissions Reduction\" and \"Energy Transition,\" \"Health, Safety, and Security\" was split into \"Health, Safety, and Well-Being\" and \"Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience,\" and \"Human Rights and Communities\" was split into \"Human Rights\" and \"Communities.\" This was due to the prominence of the individual topics and the differences in their management approaches. In addition, \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" was raised from being an aspect of the topic \"Employees\"\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / SUSTAINABILITY AT OMV\".

The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nto an individual material topic due to its central nature to the Company's sustainability strategy. As a result, OMV now has a total of twelve material topics. The results of the 2020 materiality analysis and the changes in 2021 were acknowledged by the OMV Executive Board. No changes were made to the material topics in 2022. In 2023, the OMV Group started a materiality assessment according to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the preliminary results do not show any significant deviations from the currently reported material topics.\n\nIn this Report, we disclose in detail the twelve material topics that are viewed as being most material to OMV and our stakeholders. In the following sections of the Report, we present the management approaches, governance processes, KPIs, key actions in 2023, outlook, and strategic targets for each of these material topics. The Sustainability Report is structured around the focus areas and material topics.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram that categorizes different aspects of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. Under \"Environmental,\" there are \"Climate Change\" with subcategories \"Carbon Emissions Reduction\" and \"Energy Transition,\" and \"Natural Resources Management\" with subcategories \"Circular Economy\" and \"Environment.\" Under \"Social,\" there is \"Health, Safety, and Security\" with subcategories \"Health, Safety, and Well-Being\" and \"Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience,\" and \"People\" with subcategories \"Human Rights,\" \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\" \"Employees,\" and \"Communities.\" Under \"Governance,\" there is \"Ethical Business Practices\" with subcategories \"Economic Impacts and Business Principles\" and \"Supply Chain.\"\n\n## Strategy\n\nOMV's goal is to transform from an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company into a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials, leveraging opportunities in the circular economy. An integral part of the Group's strategy is its ambition to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050 for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In view of the ongoing transformation in the energy industry and a global goal of net-zero emissions, OMV is building on its strengths and seizing opportunities to position itself competitively. Our sustainability ambitions, especially getting to net zero, can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. In our Strategy 2030, we have earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn for the purpose of achieving our emissions reduction targets.\n\n## Sustainability Criteria in Investment Decisions\n\nIn 2022, OMV updated its Capital Allocation Framework and developed a strategic scoring methodology for investment projects based on four pillars: business strategic targets, financial metrics, risk profile, and climate targets impact. This new methodology has been tested in a pilot phase. The scoring helps to objectively define and review OMV's most important strategic projects and allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support our strategy delivery, including our GHG reduction pathway. Climate scoring is an integral part of this overall scoring and covers the investment's impact on the OMV Group's Scope 1, 2, and 3 climate targets for 2030, as well as EU taxonomy relevance.\n\nAs part of the updated Capital Allocation Framework, OMV also introduced a new definition for \"sustainability CAPEX,\" which encompasses investments that meet one of two criteria: either they are aligned with the EU taxonomy or they are investments that support the implementation of OMV's 2030 Sustainability Framework. The latter includes investments related to methane leakage detection and repair, energy efficiency programs, chemical recycling, and community investments classified as strategic social investments, among others.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing, and the circle is also a line drawing.

The second icon is a left arrow inside of a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside of a circle.\n\nFor sustainability projects to pass the final investment decision, different financial hurdles apply compared to those applicable to the rest of the projects in the portfolio. Thus, \"sustainability CAPEX\" projects use distinct \"weighted average cost of capital (WACC)\" rates that consider the specific risks of sustainability projects (usually lower compared to other projects) and a payback period of <20 years (longer than for other projects). The goal of the new Capital Allocation Framework is to facilitate investments in projects aligned with our climate targets, including our long-term net zero target, rather than traditional fossil fuel-related investments.\n\nMoreover, inorganic growth projects should comply with the overall Group path to net zero by 2050 and should support the low-carbon growth of OMV. The potential impact of mergers and acquisitions on OMV's climate targets is reviewed as part of due diligence.\n\n## Environmental, Social, and Governance Ratings and Indices\n\nOMV actively engages with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating agencies and socially responsible investors to ensure that the information our external stakeholders need to evaluate sustainability risks and opportunities related to the Company's performance is disclosed. At OMV, we place great importance on working with the ESG rating agencies, and their questionnaires and feedback provide a means for OMV to assess any additional ESG data gaps. This helps us drive our sustainability agenda forward and make continuous improvements in terms of sustainability.\n\n## Latest Ratings and Indices Results\n\nOMV actively participates in several ESG ratings.

The Group's risk management processes focus on the identification, assessment, and evaluation of such risks and their impact on the Group's financial stability and profitability. The purpose of these activities is to actively manage risks in the context of the Group's risk appetite and defined risk tolerance levels in order to achieve the OMV Group's long-term strategic goals.\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks are regularly identified, assessed, and reported through the Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process. The main purpose of the OMV Group's EWRM process is to deliver value through riskbased management and decision-making, which is ensured by applying a \"three lines of defense\" model (1. business management, 2. risk management and oversight functions, 3. internal audit). The OMV Group is continually enhancing the EWRM process based on internal and external requirements, for instance developing new ESG reporting standards and frameworks. The process is facilitated by a Group-wide IT system that supports the established individual process steps, guided by the ISO 31000 risk management framework. The process also includes companies that are not fully consolidated.\n\n### Governance\n\nOMV recognizes the dynamic and evolving nature of its business landscape. Effective risk governance is crucial for successfully navigating uncertainties inherent in the nature of OMV's operations.\n\nAs an integral part of the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee diligently oversees the implementation and efficacy of our risk management processes. By leveraging the expertise within the Audit Committee and remaining adaptive through ongoing education, the Supervisory Board reinforces its commitment to robust risk governance.\n\nThe Executive Board takes a proactive stance in overseeing and enhancing OMV's risk management processes, as well as ensuring a strong risk culture across the OMV Group. A crossfunctional committee chaired by the OMV Group CFO with senior management members of the OMV Group – the Risk Committee – ensures that the risk management process effectively captures and manages material risks across the OMV Group. OMV has an effective independent Corporate Risk Management function within the CFO area that reports directly\n\nto the Executive Board and is independent from the business lines. OMV's Executive Board members regularly discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, related developments in the fuels, chemicals, and gas markets, the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations, the status of innovation project implementation, and progress on achieving sustainabilityrelated targets.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee meets at least four times a year, ensuring that risk awareness and prevention are firmly integrated into decision-making processes. The Committee validates the key non-financial and financial risks identified with respect to OMV's short- to mid- (up to three to five years) and long-term (more than five years) objectives. For more information, see the [Annual Report.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/governance)\n\nOMV focuses on assessing the potential vulnerabilities of the Company to climate change (e.g., water scarcity, droughts, floods, and landslides), the impact of the Company on the environment, and the mitigation actions that will ensure a successful transition to a low-carbon environment (e.g., reduction of carbon emissions and compliance with new regulatory requirements). The short- and midterm physical vulnerabilities related to climate change are identified and reported in the EWRM process and do not exceed OMV's reporting threshold.\n\nThe OMV Group conducts a robust, site-specific physical climate risk and vulnerability assessment in accordance with the EU taxonomy to determine the resilience of each asset to future climate change and the associated physical climate-related risks. Acute and chronic risks related to temperature, wind, water, and solid mass are first screened based on business specificity and potential impact on OMV. The two-fold approach used is in line with the EWRM approach.\n\nBased on the preselected acute and chronic risks, all OMV Group sites where EU taxonomy-eligible activities occur are prioritized. This exercise is performed with the support of a risk intelligence consultant using a set of indexes specifically aimed at providing a robust understanding of the changes in future environmental conditions for the respective locations and businesses.\n\nAll assets with medium, high, or extreme exposure to one or more acute or chronic physical climate risks are analyzed further. Physical hazard modeling is applied, consisting of the processing and analysis of atmospheric data related to temperature, precipitation, drought, and wildfires, as well as other data related to coastal flooding, tropical cyclones, water stress, and fluvial flooding, in order to provide a rigorous estimate of risk. The analysis incorporates scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The four RCPs (2.6, 4.5,\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Once the financial impact of the respective risks is estimated, potential mitigation strategies are discussed with management in order to ensure that appropriate adaptation measures are considered.\n\n### Risk Management Process\n\nThe risk management process combines an intensive bottomup and top-down approach, with every single employee responsible for implementing the most appropriate mitigation strategies for the risks within their sphere of responsibilities. Identified and assessed risks are controlled and mitigated at all organizational levels thanks to clearly defined risk policies and responsibilities. Strategic risks and opportunities (e.g., related to climate change or water stress) are assessed in a top-down process, while a bottom-up process with a standardized methodology is used to assess factors such as environmental aspects, impacts, and risks in our operations, including legal and compliance risks.\n\nESG risks are identified using a double materiality approach and a selection of the appropriate risk identification techniques, such as interviews, workshops, surveys, and analyses of historical losses, as well as information on risks documented in risk registers or loss databases. For example, environmental risks are identified using an approach such as a standardized environmental risk assessment methodology, always applying a double materiality approach whenever possible. Environmental risks and opportunities include regulatory, operational, reputational, and financial drivers, and specifically relate to issues such as climate change, availability and quality of water used for operations, and the impact of energy, climate, and water policies. Such risks are then analyzed against a short-term horizon (less than 3 years), mediumterm horizon (3–5 years), or long-term perspective (>10 years), including their possible quantitative impact as a deviation of cash flow from the plan and the likelihood of such an impact. Heat maps or risk matrices are used to support the assessment process and serve to identify probability ranges and the related consequences if risks were to materialize. Digital technologies are used in monitoring and managing environmental risks through a special risk management IT tool that integrates environmental risk scenarios with operational and business risks.\n\nFor the purpose of identifying such risks, we continuously monitor OMV's internal and external environment and conduct interviews with senior management, subject matter experts, and Executive Board members. This process complements the bottom-up approach and captures the risks inherent in the strategy. We collect information on root causes, consequences, corresponding risk mitigation actions and their effectiveness, and changes in internal and external factors influencing likelihood. These are assessed in working sessions with senior management and subject matter experts.\n\nAll risks exceeding a certain threshold at Group level are included in the Group Risk Report and considered to be substantive irrespective of their probability. However, the threshold can vary depending on the management focus for that specific risk management measure. In addition, risks are regarded as substantive if they are seen as such by relevant stakeholders, including local communities, government authorities, employees, or suppliers, even when the financial impact is not considerable.\n\nBottom-up and top-down perspectives are combined to provide a comprehensive risk profile of the organization, which is taken into consideration when the OMV strategy is developed or updated. The results of an intensive reporting exercise are discussed at the OMV Executive Board level through the Group Risk Report and further presented to the OMV Audit Committee.\n\n## Risk Taxonomy\n\nPaying attention to every single risk makes risk management a holistic process. We use common risk terminology and language across OMV to facilitate effective risk communication. ESG risks are a key element in the OMV risk taxonomy.\n\nThe full spectrum of risks relating to OMV's business, including economic, environmental, and social issues, is analyzed using either a semi-qualitative or quantitative approach and documented in a centralized risk repository. The resulting corporate risk profile provides a holistic view of issues that could affect the Company's medium- and long-term performance. The profile is therefore integrated into OMV's decision-making processes.\n\nAccording to the OMV risk taxonomy, the following risk categories are considered based on key risk drivers:\n\nFinancial risks, including market price risks, foreign exchange risks, and risks arising from (European) Emission Allowances. Market price risks are monitored and analyzed centrally with respect to their potential cash flow impact using a specific risk analysis model that considers portfolio effects. Such market price risks also cover the impact of volatile prices for European Emission Allowances, where typical mitigation activities like spot, forward, or futures transactions are applied to ensure a balanced position of emission allowances by selling the surplus or covering the gap.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- Operational risks, including all risks related to physical assets, production risks, project risks, personnel risks, IT risks, as well as HSSE, climate change, and regulatory/compliance risks, are analyzed, monitored, and managed by following the Group's defined risk management process.\n- Strategic risks arising, for example, from changes in technology, climate change, risks to reputation, or political uncertainties, including sanctions.\n\nFor reporting purposes, this taxonomy is mapped to various other risk classifications such as NaDiVeG<sup>6</sup> and TCFD. Additional information on the OMV Group's EWRM governance and processes as well as major financial and\n\nnon-financial risks are included in the Risk Management chapter in the [Annual Report 2023.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk)\n\n### Specific Sustainability Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe potential risks (divided into threats and opportunities), mitigation measures, and net risks and opportunities of OMV activities, structured according to our material topics and related NaDiVeG concerns, are summarized in the table below. Materiality in this context is defined as issues having a potentially significant impact on the environment or society (for more information, see Materiality). Risks reported were selected based on their magnitude using impact and probability, and at least one relevant example for each material topic was selected.\n\n#### **Focus Area: Climate Change**\n\n| Material Topic<br>(NaDiVeG)                                  | Risk Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Effect Description<br>(Inside-Out or Outside-In)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mitigation Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy Transition<br>(Environmental<br>concerns)             | Threat (Transition Risks):<br>Risk arising from the<br>organization's inability to<br>implement and manage new<br>technology and products to<br>reduce carbon intensity<br>impact, as well as the risk<br>caused by the delayed<br>implementation of a<br>low-carbon business due to<br>limited availability of critical<br>raw materials and/or<br>dependency on suppliers<br>within a competitive market.                                                      | Inside-Out:<br>OMV's total GHG carbon<br>footprint (Scopes 1, 2, 3) in<br>2023 amounted to 134 mn t<br>CO2 equivalent.

Therefore, assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of expected future economic conditions, which may differ from the Company's set targets, were used, including expectations about future worldwide decarbonization efforts and the transition of economies to net-zero emissions.\n\nOMV utilizes two different scenarios, namely the base case and the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' case, which differ in their underlying expectations of the pace of future worldwide decarbonization and result in distinct assumptions for demand, prices, and margins of fossil commodities.\n\nThe **base case** is built on a scenario developed by the internal Market Intelligence department and assumes that all decarbonization pledges announced by governments around the world will be implemented in full and on time. In this scenario, the temperature increase by 2100 will be limited to 1.7°C with a probability of 50%. The underlying demand and price developments of fossil commodities are in line with the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The first icon is a printer, the second icon is a left arrow, and the third icon is a right arrow.\n\nwas modeled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The base case is used for mid-term planning as well as for estimates relating to the measurement of various items in the Group financial statements, including impairment testing of non-financial assets and the measurement of provisions.\n\nThe **'net-zero emissions by 2050'** case, which is based on a faster decarbonization path than the base case, is used for calculating sensitivities to recognize the uncertainty of the pace of the energy transition and to better understand the financial risk of the energy transition on the existing assets of OMV. The assumptions used in this case are in line with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario modeled by the IEA. It shows a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and is compatible with limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C.\n\nSensitivities, calculated based on the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' climate scenario using a simplified method consistent with a DCF model for impairment testing, indicate a risk of impairments of oil and gas assets, assessing the resilience against the energy transition risks.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the oil and gas assets with proved reserves (incl. E&P at-equity investments) would have to be decreased by EUR 4.4 bn and goodwill would decrease by EUR 0.3 bn. In addition, all oil and gas assets with unproved reserves would be abandoned with a pretax P&L impact of EUR 0.3 bn. Total post-tax impact on P&L would be EUR 3.6 bn.\n\nAs far as the C&M segment is concerned, management would not foresee negative effects on the overall demand of polyolefin solutions in the accelerated decarbonization scenario. Pricing of polyolefins is mainly driven by base chemical markets like naphtha, ethane, and propane. An accelerated change in the world's energy landscape might lead to different price movements in those relevant base\n\nchemicals, temporarily affecting the profitability of some assets in the polyolefin value chain. Driven by the expected strong demand for polyolefin solutions, management does not foresee any substantial negative effects on the overall integrated value chain.\n\nOMV plans to transform its European refineries so that they will stay competitive as the decarbonization of the fuels and chemical sector progresses. Crude oil distillation throughput will be decreased. The product mix will be adapted to reduce heating oil and diesel output while increasing the chemical yield. In parallel, a production portfolio of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks will be developed. Taking into account these transformation plans, management does not foresee a significant risk that the existing refinery assets in Europe would not be recoverable in the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' scenario.\n\nIt is expected that declines in demand for fossil products caused by the energy transition will progress more slowly outside the European Union. The investment in ADNOC Refining is assumed to be resilient also in a Paris Agreement-aligned the energy transition scenario thanks to its access to markets in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nFor retail, cash flows of less than ten years were sufficient to demonstrate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the currently existing assets. Consequently, there was no need to perform a calculation under the 'net-zero emissions by 2050' scenario.\n\nFor further information on base case and 'net-zero emissions by 2050' assumptions, please refer to the [Effects of](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/2-effects-of-climate-change-and-the-energy-transition.html) [climate change and the energy transition](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/notes/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements/basis-of-preparation-and-accounting-policies/2-effects-of-climate-change-and-the-energy-transition.html) section in the Annual Report, while risks from climate change and their management are detailed in the Risks and Opportunities section of the Sustainability Report and the [Risk Manage](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk.html)[ment section of the Directors' Report.](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/directors-report/risk.html)\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Focus Areas\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **Climate Change**\n- **Natural Resources Management**\n- **Health, Safety, and Security**\n- **People**\n- **Ethical Business Practices**\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/47/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

By 2050, OMV aims to transform into a net-zero business.<sup>7</sup>\n\nOMV has set out a roadmap with concrete interim short-, medium-, and long-term targets. OMV's targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scopes 1 and 2, OMV is aiming for an absolute reduction of 30% by 2030 and of 60% by 2040. For Scope 3, OMV is striving for a reduction of at least 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040 from our product portfolio and other material Scope 3 emissions. These absolute GHG emission reductions and the increase of zero-carbon product energy sales are key in reducing the carbon intensity of our energy supply, pursuing a decline of 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040. These targets are approximated to IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). However, our ambition is to achieve net-zero emissions already by 2050, thus being aligned with the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).\n\nTo achieve these targets, OMV takes climate action in its operations, product and service portfolio, circular economy activities, innovations and R&D activities, working environment, and social investments. There is no silver bullet for tackling climate change. Reaching our targets for 2030 and beyond will require a considerable effort by all of our business units, but it will be done by building on existing strengths and know-how.\n\nThese are the key pillars that will enable us to meet our goals:\n\n- A significant decrease in fossil fuels and natural gas sales: By 2030, we intend to reduce oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and cut crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t.\n- An increase in zero-carbon product energy sales: There will be a significant increase in sustainable and biobased fuels, green gas sales, and a build-up of renewable electricity capacity for captive use, as well as geothermal heat.\n- An increase in the recycling of polyolefins and sustainable feedstocks: We will deliver approximately 2 mn t/year of circular products, that is, polyolefins manufactured from recyclate or biogenic feedstock rather than fossil sources.\n- Improved energy and operational efficiency, and zero routine flaring and venting, thereby reducing methane emissions.\n- All energy purchases in the C&M segment will be 100% renewable. In 2023, electricity purchased by C&M accounted for 10 PJ – approximately 73% of OMV's total electricity purchased.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, neutralization measures such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will be necessary. OMV anticipates that it will develop around 5 mn t per year of CCS capacity across all business units until 2030. OMV aims to support and accelerate the energy transition with this new strategy.\n\nThe commitment \"net-zero business by 2050\" covers the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our operations (Scopes 1 and 2), and our product portfolio and other Scope 3 emissions along the value chain. For our interim GHG targets for 2030 and 2040, Scopes 1 and 2 and the following Scope 3 categories are included: Category 11: Use of Sold Products for energy supply, Category 1: Purchased Goods (feedstocks) from OMV's C&M business segment, and Category 12: End-of-Life of Sold Products for non-energy use. 7\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/4 description: The image is a bar graph showing a reduction in emissions over time.

The first icon, on the left, is set against a yellow background and features the number '7' prominently displayed at the top left. To the right of the number, the words 'AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY' are written in smaller font. Below the text, there is a white graphic of a sun with a power button symbol in the center.

Below the text, there is a white graphic of an eye with a globe in the center.\n\nThe Carbon Emissions Reduction material topic focuses on reducing the GHG emissions of our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) through targeted efforts such as improving energy efficiency, increased use of renewable electricity, modernizing our equipment and processes, and reducing venting and flaring of gas. These efforts are integral to meeting our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by 2050, which is also incorporated into our HSSE Policy. As part of our Strategy 2030, we have set specific interim targets for the short (2025), medium (2030), and long term (2040) on the path to meeting our 2050 goals.\n\nThe OMV Group uses 2019 as its base year for all three scopes of emissions and for our 2030, 2040, and 2050 targets because 2019 was the last full year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the majority of the OMV Group's assets were operating for the whole of 2019.\n\n| Targets 2025 | Reduce carbon intensity of operations8 (Scope 1) ≥30% vs. 2010<br>Achieve at least 1 mn t of CO2 reductions in 2020–2025 from operated assets |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target 2030  | Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by ≥30% vs. 2019                                                                                      |\n| Target 2040  | Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by ≥60% vs. 2019                                                                                      |\n\nCO2 equivalent emissions produced to generate a certain business output using the following business-specific metrics – in the E&P assets within OMV Energy: t CO2 equivalent/toe produced; refineries: t CO2 equivalent/t throughput (crude and semi-finished products without blended volumes); power: t CO2 equivalent/MWh produced – consolidated into an OMV Group Carbon Intensity Index, based on weighted average of the business segments' carbon intensity 8\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The OMV Group's comprehensive approach to managing GHG emissions encompasses GHG and energy accounting and reporting, inventory management, audits, assessment plans, and training for employees. The Group Sustainability team is also audited by OMV's internal auditing team on the completeness, correctness, reporting processes and methodologies, and quality assurance processes of our GHG accounting to confirm that the OMV Group reports Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in a complete and correct manner, that the accounting methodology complies with international standards, and that the reporting process is adequate. The last internal audit was conducted in 2020.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team continues to conduct on-site audits of GHG accounting to verify and improve transparency. For instance, in 2023 the team audited asset Valahia in OMV Petrom, which included a detailed assessment of the process of collecting data, the process of managing the data (measurement, estimations, assumptions, calculations, forecasts, consolidation, etc.), and the process of internal and external data communications. The audit confirmed the good practices already in place and highlighted some potential areas for improvement. For all findings and non-conformities, respective action plans are being defined and tracked for close-out in OMV's HSSE reporting tool.\n\n#### Governance\n\nUltimate responsibility for reducing carbon emissions lies with OMV's Executive Board. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for the overall management and coordination and is therefore also responsible for overseeing climate-related issues. OMV Executive Board members meet regularly (at least quarterly) to discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, related developments in the fuels and gas market, the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations, the status of innovation project implementation, and progress on achieving climate targets. The Executive Board's remuneration is linked to the achievement of our GHG emissions reduction targets (for more information, see Sustainability Governance).\n\nOMV's Supervisory Board also oversees the carbon emissions reduction topic. The Sustainability & Transformation Committee was formed in 2021 to support the Company's Supervisory Board in reviewing and monitoring OMV's sustainability strategy, ESG-related standards, performance, and processes, and specifically, the Group's performance in HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, Environment) and climate change. For example, one of their responsibilities is to review and evaluate the progress we are making toward OMV's objectives in relation to our carbon footprint, climate change, and the energy transition.\n\nAt Group level, responsibility for GHG accounting and management, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability team in Investor Relations & Sustainability, an area overseen by the CFO. OMV's Group Sustainability department is responsible for generating OMV's GHG inventory based on international standards and best practice. This ensures a consistent approach across the Group.\n\nThe main tasks of the team are:\n\nto define, implement, and manage OMV's GHG Management Framework, including the OMV Group's Climate Targets\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a triangular roof and a rectangular body.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n- to monitor, calculate, and report OMV's GHG emissions (Scopes 1–3), and\n- to define OMV's GHG accounting and reporting protocols and tools.\n\nThe team coordinates activities throughout the business, providing guidance to stakeholder groups such as subsidiaries, business units, and assets on GHG and energyrelated topics. To ensure consistency across the Group, there are also dedicated teams in OMV Petrom and Borealis. Tailored voluntary training on GHG accounting, monitoring and management, sustainability, and climate change is developed by the experts in the Group Sustainability team and offered to interested employees Groupwide.\n\nIn OMV's Capital Allocation Framework, a project category called \"Sustainability Projects\" allows certain projects to meet different economic return requirements. These projects are assessed and scored according to a strategic climate scoring methodology for Group-wide investment projects. This enables the impact of investments on OMV's decarbonization strategy to be considered. Alongside other strategic scoring aspects, this allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support the achievement of our GHG reduction targets (for more information, see Sustainability Governance).\n\nThe Group-wide GHG Management Framework is an OMV Group regulation that defines how to measure, report, and manage GHG emissions and contains the definitions, boundaries, and rules for the OMV Group's strategic GHG reduction targets and \"net zero by 2050\" ambition. The regulation also includes requirements for Scope 1 E&P methane emissions accounting, which will align with the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Framework as a minimum and require sourcelevel measurement of methane emissions (OGMP 2.0 level 4) operated by the Energy division by 2026. According to OGMP 2.0, Level 4 refers to the source level quantification of methane emissions using specific emissions factors established through direct measurements, sampling, and/ or detailed engineering calculations.\n\n## Flaring, Venting, and Fugitive Methane Emissions\n\nDuring oil production, associated gas is produced together with the oil. While much of this gas is utilized, some of it is routinely flared due to technical or economic constraints, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane. In 2017, to reinforce our clear commitment to responsible resource management and sustainable business, we endorsed the World Bank's \"Zero routine flaring by 2030\" initiative to end routine flaring of\n\nassociated gas during oil production by 2030. Phasing out routine flaring is an essential step in combining resource efficiency with long-term economic success, as well as a way of supporting the decarbonization of our operations. We see financial opportunities in the monetization of hydrocarbon resources by utilizing the previously flared gas and/or selling it. Phasing out routine flaring improves the environmental and safety conditions at our respective assets, thereby enabling us to not only maintain our license to operate but also avoid any penalties.\n\nReducing methane emissions from the routine/non-routine venting of gas during oil and gas production and processing, as well as from gas leaks, also contributes to slowing down climate change and provides a valuable mitigation option for climate risk management. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. It is the most abundant anthropogenic GHG after CO2 and second in its overall contribution to climate change. Its greenhouse effect is significantly stronger in the short term, making it more potent than CO2. In our climate strategy, we therefore also introduced a target for reducing methane emissions for the first time.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Phasing Out Routine Flaring and Venting**\n\nAround 1% of OMV's total direct GHG emissions and around 5% of OMV's Energy GHG direct emissions result from routine flaring. With stricter policies requiring zero routine flaring expected, OMV has taken initial steps toward compliance by voluntarily endorsing the World Bank's \"Zero routine flaring by 2030\" initiative. We report to the World Bank on our progress on this initiative annually. All OMV operations are required to minimize methane emissions from point sources, as well as fugitive emissions and technically avoidable emissions (such as well testing and well workover, among others). New production sites are developed with the appropriate gas utilization solutions in place and without routine flaring. Existing sites, where routine flaring of associated and free gas still occurs, are required to develop a phase-out plan to eliminate legacy routine flaring as soon as possible, but no later than 2030.\n\nIn our refineries, state-of-the-art plant design is implemented to avoid routine flaring, for example through the use of flare gas recovery and balancing the fuel gas systems. This type of advanced process control includes sufficient capacity for the flare gas recovery system, the use of high-integrity relief valves, and other economically viable organizational and control measures. All refineries use a flare gas recovery system to collect excess gas, which is desulphurized as required, pressurized, and added to the refinery fuel gas system as fuel for the process furnaces. As a result of such measures, we aim to use flaring as a safety system during unplanned operations, which include\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nstart-up, shutdown, emergency, process upsets, and others. At the Petrobrazi refinery in particular, the capacity for flare gas recovery has been increased over the past few years. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are minimized by applying the best available techniques (BATs) in such areas as hydrocarbon storage and tank seals according to implementation plans.\n\n#### **Fugitive Emissions Monitoring and Leak Detection and Repair**\n\nFugitive methane emissions and other non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are monitored or estimated and controlled systematically with leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs. Knowing the main potential sources of methane emissions also allows us to implement precautionary measures for preventing such emissions at new production assets. The minimum requirement for identifying leaks is conducting routine audio, visual, and olfactory inspections as part of daily operator rounds at all relevant OMV operating facilities. Leak detection also entails soap-bubble testing and optical gas imaging with defined scopes and intervals (annually or more frequently, as required in accordance with a corresponding risk assessment). At some facilities, infrared cameras are also used for leak detection. We also collaborate with third parties to further enhance state-of-the-art methane monitoring with technologies such as drones, satellite data, and acoustic leak imaging.\n\nLeaks are repaired immediately or within defined time frames and, depending on prioritization, according to the site's maintenance processes. These are based on the risk assessment outcomes and other factors including feasibility of repair during operation. To prevent and mitigate fugitive emissions, we have taken important steps, including implementing a pipeline integrity program and modernizing facilities such as compressor stations.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Decarbonization Initiatives**\n\nAt OMV Petrom, several initiatives have been initiated to reduce methane emissions, routine venting, and flaring, including various modernization and upgrade projects for oil and gas processing, production, and transportation infrastructure. In 2023, the Production System Padina in Asset Moldova installed a combined heat and power unit (CHP) that recovers the gas that would otherwise be vented and/or flared. This will result in an emissions reduction of approximately 18,000 t CO2e during the first full year after implementation.\n\n- In August 2023, a performance test for the Bărbuncești Compressor Station in Asset Moldova was successfully carried out before it was put into operation. This project is partly a continuation of the project initiated in 2014 and aims to improve the performance of the compression system. As an integrating section for that project, the Merișani-Vâlcele and Brăgăreasa-Colelia compression stations were completed and the Brădești compression station is currently under construction. The new system architecture will reduce operational costs significantly, ensure flexible and safe natural gas collection and compression, and improve safety by introducing new equipment while dismantling old equipment that present some integrity problems and significant operational risks. The new system meets the Transgaz requirements for increasing system pressures up to 40 barg. Lower GHG emissions are expected by minimizing possible leaks and through more efficient energy consumption.\n- 2023 was a milestone year for OMV New Zealand in terms of the completion of decarbonization projects. Two projects were implemented at the Raroa production system in Asset Maari. First, a reverse osmosis unit was installed in order to replace the steam-driven water maker. Reducing the steam demand resulted in lower consumption of the fuel oil, leading to an emissions reduction of approximately 6,000 t CO2e. The second project's scope was the replacement of fuel gas with nitrogen in the flare purge process. A nitrogen generator was already available on site, offering an opportunity for the project to minimize investment costs. The emissions reduction impact from this project is estimated at approximately 3,000 t CO2e. Other projects with a decarbonization effect in New Zealand that have been trialed or implemented include changes to the turbine's operating concept, pressure optimization at the production separator, optimization of the compressor surge controller, and installation of solar panels on the roof of the warehouse. The combined emissions reduction impact from these projects is approximately 4,200 t CO2e.\n- As OMV and Borealis operate joint facilities in Schwechat and Burghausen, we strive to identify and increase joint synergies across both sites. For instance, at the Burghausen refinery from mid-2023, the quantity of flared gas was reduced, as the discontinuous nitrogen-rich gases produced by OMV were combusted in the Borealis regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) plant, rather than being sent to the elevated flare.\n- Borealis completed the cracker furnace upgrade in Stenungsund, Sweden, with the final furnace upgraded in 2023. This will generate a total annual reduction of up to 24,000 t CO2e.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/53/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nFlaring was reduced in Porvoo, Finland, which resulted in savings of 500 t CO2e annually.\n\n#### **Leak Detection and Repair**\n\nOMV consistently implements leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs to reduce our fugitive emissions. Important steps have been taken to prevent and mitigate fugitive emissions, such as the pipeline integrity program in OMV Energy and the LDAR program in both OMV Energy and Fuels & Feedstock (F&F). An LDAR program includes two fundamental steps: first, the identification of the leaking components and second, the repair of these leaks to minimize losses. This program serves as the basis for developing reduction projects in accordance with best practices in the industry and using the best available technologies. LDAR programs are routinely run both upstream (OMV Energy) and downstream (OMV F&F) to detect, prevent, and eliminate fugitive emissions. In OMV Energy, following the guidelines of the GHG Management Framework, methane emission programs have been established in line with the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Framework, which accepts LDAR as the most efficient method for detecting fugitive methane emissions from the operations and mitigating them. In OMV Austria, an internal LDAR team has been formed in order to perform regular screening of the production and processing sites by utilizing high-standard technologies (e.g., OGI, FLIR cameras, etc.). In addition, more than 300 facilities are included in the internal LDAR program led by Operations in OMV Petrom, which covers methane screening using FLIR cameras and mitigation of identified leakages. Furthermore, LDAR programs have become an integral part of operations, establishing strong partnerships with external service providers for compliance with our GHG Management Framework, as well as with other frameworks such as upcoming EU Regulations for methane emissions in the energy sector.\n\n#### **Methane Reporting**\n\nIn line with the OMV Group's GHG Management Framework, which references the OGMP 2.0, OMV Energy-operated businesses shall reach source-level measurement of methane emissions (equivalent with Level 4) by the end of 2025.\n\nFurthermore, the upcoming EU methane legislation will introduce additional stringent requirements for methane leak detection and repair programs, as well as for methane monitoring and reporting at source level and site level. In OMV Energy, OMV has already started taking important steps toward compliance with both the GHG Management Framework and the EU methane reporting requirements within the given deadlines for the ventures that are affected, i.e., OMV Austria and OMV Petrom.\n\nGlobal and local methane management programs (such as Ops CH4llenge at OMV Petrom) have been established within OMV Energy with the purpose of preparing the operations' organization for the new methane detection, measurement and reporting requirements. For that purpose, multiple pilot tests with various technologies, solutions, and service providers were executed by the end of 2023. An extensive pilot project has been completed at representative sites in three assets at OMV Petrom. The detection and quantification services were performed by third-party specialized contractors. This enabled us to achieve the following reporting levels:\n\n- Source-level methane emissions for operated assets by direct measurements and sampling to establish the specific emission factors\n- Source-level methane emissions for operated assets complemented by measurements of site-level methane emissions, thereby allowing assessment and verification of the source-level estimates aggregated by site\n\nBased on the outcome of the pilot project, a rollout strategy has been developed and converted into a scope of work for outsourcing the services for methane measurement reporting and verification for affected assets at OMV Austria and Romania.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, OMV will continue to pursue projects to further phase out routine flaring and venting, reduce Scope 1 emissions, and expand and intensify our LDAR campaigns. For example, an LDAR campaign has been planned in Tunisia, where pilot Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) camera screening will be conducted for the Gas Treatment Plant (GTP) to quantify the leaks and establish an appropriate action plan. In addition, other sustainability and decarbonization projects that specifically target flaring and venting reduction and are currently in the execution phase in multiple assets at OMV Petrom are expected to be completed by 2025 at the latest. At the Burghausen refinery, the current gasometer is scheduled to be replaced with a membrane gasometer, which has a greater gas storage volume. This is expected to reduce the intervals and quantity of gas flared, and result in an annual reduction of 1,800 t CO2e.\n\nIn general, we will focus on reducing fugitive methane emissions through process optimization, field modernization, and integrity improvement measures in OMV Energy. We continue to define and implement methane leakage, detection, and repair programs in all OMV Energy-operated assets, as well as establishing standard methane reporting with the required granularity (e.g., source level, site level).\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white house icon inside.

In 2019, the value is 117.4. In 2020, the value is 131.1. In 2021, the value is 176.2. In 2022, the value is 163.2. In 2023, the value is 142.9.\n\nAs an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company, the OMV Group operates large facilities and is also a major energy consumer. The amount of energy we use creates a significant impact on the environment. Effective management of energy consumption reduces the environmental cost of our operations, increases financial savings owing to our energy efficiency measures, prevents non-compliance with regulatory requirements on energy use, and reduces GHG emissions.\n\nEnergy efficiency measures therefore have a considerable effect on issues relating to energy consumption and are of particular interest to certain stakeholders:\n\n- Government authorities: compliance with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) regulations relating to the submission of emission allowances within the EU ETS, compliance with the national transposition of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, which requires greater energy efficiency in all stages of the energy value chain, and performing obligatory energy efficiency audits every four years\n- Shareholders and other stakeholders with a direct financial interest in the OMV Group: financial savings resulting from reduced energy consumption, lower production costs, and lower GHG emissions\n- NGOs/NPOs: reduced impact of our operations on the environment\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n**57%** of sites are ISO 50001 certified\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires that all OMV businesses and activities use energy responsibly, conserve primary energy resources, and\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer, the second icon is a left arrow, and the third icon is a right arrow.\n\nimplement energy management plans in accordance with ISO 50001.\n\n#### **Identification Measures**\n\nThe potential for reducing energy use is identified in annual campaigns encouraging improved environmental performance, including energy consumption. For example, we have set targets for the refineries to reach certain energy intensity index ratings through annual monitoring campaigns. Based on their energy intensity, we identify and assess areas for improvement in terms of energy efficiency. Subsequently, we decide which measures to implement to reduce energy consumption as part of our environmental governance process.\n\nBorealis is responsible for 24% of the energy consumption of the OMV Group. Furthermore, Borealis sees the energyefficiency-first principle as a cornerstone in achieving its climate strategy. The defined energy ambition is to implement 10% energy savings of the consumption of 2015 by 2030. As OMV and Borealis operate joint facilities in Schwechat and Burghausen, an initiative to identify and increase joint synergies across both sites was established.\n\nProjects identified in 2022 were evaluated during 2023, with the potential for implementation from 2024 onward. For instance, the Schwechat refinery currently supplies boiler feed water to the Borealis facility. By adapting the supply lines, this boiler feed water can be replaced with cheaper, colder, and fully desalinated water, resulting in energy and CO2 savings.\n\n#### **Technical Improvements**\n\nEnergy efficiency measures in OMV operations are closely linked with technical improvements directed at reducing energy use while achieving the same operational output. Process optimization and increasing energy efficiency to reduce costs and CO2 emissions are also a priority at our refineries. At the Schwechat refinery, measures have included the optimization of the blade rows in one of the steam turbines, which has resulted in an increase in the efficiency of the high-pressure section of the turbine, and a subsequent increase in the electrical output equal to the steam rate. Ultrasonic atomizer nozzles for power plant boilers were also installed to promote the atomization of liquid fuel to improve the quality of combustion. This resulted in a reduction in exhaust gas losses, fuel demand, combustion air demand, and CO2 emissions.\n\nThe implementation of planned energy efficiency measures was interrupted by the unplanned shutdown of the RD4 crude oil distillation plant at the Schwechat refinery in 2022, resulting in severe delays. Some of the measures were implemented in 2023, and those remaining are expected to be finalized in 2024.\n\n#### **Sourcing Renewable Energy for Operations**\n\nWe are increasingly turning to renewable sources of electricity to power our operations. One way of doing this is by purchasing renewable energy, which subsequently reduces our Scope 2 emissions. For instance, in our refineries in Schwechat and Burghausen, electricity contracts stipulate that 50% of purchased electricity must be from renewable sources. As such, in 2023, 50% of the purchased electricity at the Schwechat refinery and the Adria Wien Pipeline (AWP), 51.8% at the Burghausen refinery, including tank farms and pumping stations, came from renewable sources. 100% of the electricity purchased by OMV's Austrian filling stations and the head office are obtained from renewable sources. For OMV's refineries and the AWP, the electricity contracts are generally spot-indexed and contracted on a one- to threeyear basis. Commodity pricing risk is managed using financial risk instruments.\n\nTo reduce our Scope 2 emissions and to achieve the target Borealis has set of sourcing 100% of the electricity it uses from renewable sources by 2030, the OMV Group continued to establish Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to source renewable electricity on a longer-term basis, and sourced the electricity and utilities needed for its production processes. Several PPAs with renewable energy providers are already in place. These include:\n\n- PPA between OMV and WEB Windenergie AG. With an output of 5.6 MW and annual electricity production of 13.7 GWh, the anticipated clean wind energy supplied to the OMV Group will be used to generate green hydrogen using an electrolyzer at the Schwechat refinery in 2023.\n- Borealis and Finnish energy company Fortum have signed a long-term PPA to source renewable energy from two onshore wind parks. Starting mid-2024, 800 GWh of renewable power will be supplied to the Borealis production operations in Porvoo, Finland, over the course of eight years.\n- Borealis and Axpo Nordic, a subsidiary of Switzerland's largest renewable energy provider, have a PPA for wind energy, which includes the annual supply of more than 130,000 MWh of wind power to the Borealis production location in Stenungsund, Sweden, over the next ten years. The electricity will be generated by a new onshore wind farm (Hultema) located in central Sweden, with delivery expected to start in January 2024.\n- In Belgium, Borealis has a PPA with Eneco, a Dutch energy supplier. The energy will be generated by an existing offshore wind park (Mermaid) located in the North Sea.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nBorealis has a co-investment agreement with VERBUND to build a PV plant (4.8 MWp) at its production location in Schwechat, Austria, and a ten-year PPA to obtain renewable hydroelectricity from two existing hydro plants in Austria, which are part of VERBUND's portfolio.\n\nTo help reduce our Scope 1 emissions, the OMV Group also produces renewable energy and uses it to power our operations. Some of these initiatives include:\n\n- In Austria, OMV and VERBUND built a ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) plant at Schönkirchen with a total capacity of 15.32 MWp. The generated electricity is used for ongoing operations in OMV Energy Austria. Since mid-2022, the photovoltaic plant installed during both Phases I and II has been operational simultaneously. In 2023, approx. 13.6 GWh of renewable energy was produced and used for ongoing operations at our Austrian E&P assets within our OMV Energy business segment.\n- The commercial operation of OMV's PV installation in Lobau began in early 2022, where a PV tracker system with an output of 5.6 MWp was installed. In comparison to a fixed installation, the tracker system, which follows the path of the sun, enables an increase in the generation of sustainable electricity of approximately 10%. Production efficiency was increased by another 5% by installing solar panels with bifacial (double-sided) modules. In 2023, the PV plant at the Lobau tank farm produced around 7.0 GWh of renewable energy covering approximately 45% of the annual electricity demand of the tank farm and resulting in savings of around 2,100 t CO2 per year.\n- In Norway, our joint venture partner Equinor reached full output of renewable power produced from the largest floating offshore wind farm called Hywind Tampen. The Hywind Tampen wind farm consists of eleven floating wind turbines with a total capacity of 88 MW, offsetting 200,000 t of CO2 emissions and 1,000 t of NOx emissions per year. The capacity covers the annual power demand of five platforms at the Snorre and Gullfaks oil and gas fields in the North Sea. In 2023, 48.3 MW of renewable energy was delivered to the Snorre and Gullfaks fields and 50,000 t CO2 emissions were saved.\n- The Cosmești solar park comprises 6,500 photovoltaic panels installed over an area of approximately 30,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The green energy produced (approximately 2,500 MWh/year) will be used to supply electricity for ongoing operations in the E&P segment. This will result in a reduction of about 550 t CO2.\n- The Brădești solar park comprises 3,350 photovoltaic panels installed over an area of approximately 18,500 m<sup>2</sup>. The green energy produced (approximately 1,200 MWh/year) will be used to supply electricity for ongoing operations in the E&P segment. This will result in a reduction of about 250 t CO2.\n- In Tunisia, utility air compressors with photovoltaic panels were installed at the Waha wells, while the Nawara well sites and pipeline valve stations were also equipped with PV panels for autonomous electricity generation.\n- By the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, PV panels were installed at approximately 1,700 OMV and OMV Petrom filling stations The electricity produced from these installations annually is estimated at 8,900 MWh and presents savings of approximately 2,400 t CO2e.\n- The installation of solar panels on the roof of the warehouse in Māui, New Zealand, was completed in 2023. 196 panels were installed with approximately 78 kW capacity; of that, approximately 20 kW is used for internal purposes and the excess is exported.\n\nBorealis is working to reduce its energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and increased the share of renewable energy consumed from 28% in 2022 to approximately 38% in 2023, as well as signing PPAs to lock in renewable energy supply for years to come.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Energy Efficiency**\n\nEnergy efficiency measures implemented at our three refineries in 2023 have made it possible to achieve an annual reduction of more than 27.5 kt CO2e and energy savings of 654 TJ. These include:\n\n- The HDS2 project was implemented at the Burghausen refinery in June 2023. It has an annual savings potential of about 37 TJ and CO2 savings potential of about 2.1 kt. Thanks to the two new and improved reactor effluent heat exchangers, the fired heat in the HDS2 furnace can be reduced.\n- Due to commissioning and the refinery shutdown, the District Heating Hub at the Schwechat refinery was not in full operation in 2023. When it was operational, around 100 TJ and 6 kt of CO2 was saved.\n- At OMV Petrom, an upgrade of the aromatic complex was initiated at the Petrobrazi refinery, and once finalized in 2025, it will achieve an annual saving of approximately 49 TJ and a CO2 savings potential of about 3.2 kt. These savings will be achieved thanks to the extractive distillation technology, which reduces the amount of steam consumed.\n\nIn C&M, examples of energy efficiency measures taken include the following:\n\nBorealis successfully completed a major upgrade to its steam cracker operations in Stenungsund, Sweden. The overhaul is expected to realize yearly CO2 emissions reductions of up to 24,000 t.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nA new regenerative thermal oxidizer was successfully installed at Porvoo and is expected to significantly lower the site's CO2 emissions, reduce flaring, and save around 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy annually.\n\nIn OMV's Energy segment, the key energy efficiency projects included the following:\n\n- In Norway, OMV and Wintershall signed a five-year rig contract for the use of the Transocean Norge platform. OMV will drill a minimum of seven wells with this rig, including four exploration wells and one development well. Energy efficiency is part of a contract incentive to reduce fuel consumption and further reduce CO2 and NOx emissions. The rig was used in a drilling campaign in August and September 2023 that resulted in an emissions reduction of 27% and 76% reduction of NOx. In the Velocette drilling campaign, energy optimization software and a closed bus system for dynamic positioning were employed to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 27%.\n- In the Māui field in New Zealand, the Māui A gas turbine generators were optimized by shifting the load between two units, thus allowing them to operate more efficiently. At the Māui Production Station, the surge controllers on the refrigerator compressors were also optimized, reducing the gas recycle as a result. Between the two projects, a saving of approximately 4,250 t CO2e will be achieved annually.\n- A legally required energy audit was conducted for Waha CPF, Nawara CPF, and GTP to assess the energy performance of the plants and implement appropriate improvement actions.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nWe will continue to identify measures to improve energy efficiency and operational renewable energy initiatives. Examples of actions to be taken in the coming years are as follows:\n\n- At the Schwechat refinery, a new preheating system will be installed for steam boiler 5, which is expected to result in an estimated saving of 2,000 t CO2e.\n- In Burghausen, the waste steam condensate stream from the Metathesis plant will be used to heat the cooler steam condensate from the crack-gas compressor increasing the energy efficiency of the process and resulting in an annual reduction of approximately 2,300 t CO2e. By 2025, OMV Petrom aims to install PVs at half of its network of OMV Petrom filling stations. PV panels at additional OMV filling stations in Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia are also scheduled to be installed in 2024.\n- In Austria, additional PV plants will become operational, including in Arbesthal and Würmlach, which will have a power output of approximately 1.1 MWp and 3 MWp respectively.\n\nWe will continue to increase our sourcing of renewable energy to power our operations. For the OMV Group, will aim to source an additional 580–780 GWh per annum of renewable electricity through additional PPAs and solar power investments. In C&M, the segment purchasing the greatest amount of energy, our aim is to ensure that all energy purchased is renewable by 2030. In the future, where local regulations permit, we also plan to produce renewable energy and feed it into the electricity grid for use by third parties. The potential for doing this in the countries where we have business operations is currently being evaluated.\n\n## Energy Transition\n\n#### **Material Topic: Energy Transition**\n\nSupporting the goals of the Paris Agreement by reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, specifically by increasing sales of zero-carbon energy products such as renewable mobility fuels and renewable power\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\nGRI 305: Emissions 2016 Environmental concerns\n\n**Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/21 description: The image contains two Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) icons. The first icon, on the left, is SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. It features the number 7 and the text \"AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY\" above a white sun-like symbol with a power button in the center, all set against a yellow background. The second icon, on the right, is SDG 13: Climate Action. It displays the number 13 and the text \"CLIMATE ACTION\" above a white eye-shaped symbol containing a depiction of the Earth, all set against a green background.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an oil, gas, and chemicals company, we are aware that a large percentage of our emissions come from the use of our products. At present, about 78% of the OMV Group's products are directly used for combustion, significantly contributing to global climate change. As such, we have a unique responsibility in this regard, and understand that a \"business as usual\" approach is no longer an option.\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/13 description: This image is a pie chart titled \"GHG Scope 3 Emissions from Products\" and shows the breakdown of emissions in mn t CO2 equivalent. The total emissions are 100 mn t CO2. The chart includes the following categories and their corresponding values: Oil to energy (e.g., transportation fuels) at 57.5, Gas to energy at 30.6, Chemicals at 5.0, Oil to non-energy (e.g., petrochemicals) at 5.1, and Gas to non-energy (e.g., methanol) at 1.3.\n\nThe Energy Transition material topic focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, specifically through increasing sales of zero-carbon energy products such as renewable mobility fuels and renewable power. This is the centerpiece of OMV's commitment to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, and becoming a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner in alignment with the IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. To concretize our 2050 goals, we have set mid- and long-term targets to reduce our absolute Scope 3 emissions by at least 20% by 2030 and by at least 50% by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. In addition, we intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy supply by at least 20% by 2030 and by at least 50% by 2040, both against the baseline year 2019. These intermediate targets on our pathway to net zero by 2050 are approximated to the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which foresees limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2°C and is thus aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### **Carbon Intensity of Energy Supply**<sup>11</sup>\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/5 description: The image is a line graph titled \"Carbon Intensity of Energy Supply\" with the y-axis labeled \"In g CO2/MJ\". The x-axis represents years from 2019 to 2023, and target years 2030 and 2040. The data points for the years 2019 to 2023 are as follows: 2019: 69.8, 2020: 68.2, 2021: 67.4, 2022: 67.5, 2023: 69.1. The target values are 55.9 for 2030 and 34.9 for 2040.\n\nOur absolute emissions targets cover all parts of the OMV Group, i.e., the upstream, downstream, and chemicals segments and their respective value chains. These divisions are expected to decarbonize at different rates, with a higher rate of decarbonization forecast in our energy segments (Energy and Fuels & Feedstock). This is attributable to the immediate reductions that will be achieved by our plans to minimize fossil fuel production and sales: We aim to decrease oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and reduce crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t, both by 2030. Growth in these segments will instead come from zerocarbon products, such as geothermal energy, photovoltaic, wind, hydrogen, and sustainable fuels. In our Energy segment, we will build up around 10 TWh of renewable energy production (including geothermal, PV, and wind). In our Fuels & Feedstock (F&F) segment, we are primarily focusing on finding solutions for hard-to-electrify market segments, such as heavy road transportation and air travel, as well as providing feedstock for greener chemical production. Overall, we plan to grow production of renewable mobility fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks to approximately 1.5 mn t and produce and market at least 700 kta of sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. This scale-up of zero-carbon energy product sales while decreasing fossil fuel sales is central to OMV's climate strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, our chemicals segment is projected to grow by 35% in monomer production volumes and 30% in polyolefins production volumes by 2030. In this non-energy segment, we will also reduce our Scope 3 emissions by pursuing circular economy technologies, but not at the same rate as our energy segments.\n\nIn this material topic, we focus on reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply, as encapsulated in the key metric \"carbon intensity of energy supply,\" for which we have also set 2030 and 2040 targets. However, our circular economy solutions also play a central role in our climate and carbon footprint reduction strategy. Read more about our efforts on this topic in Circular Economy.\n\n<sup>10</sup> Includes Scope 3, Category 10: Processing of sold products, and Scope 3, Category 11: Use of sold products\n\n<sup>11</sup> The carbon intensity of the energy supply is measured by assessing the intensity of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions plus Scope 3 emissions (in g CO2) from the use of sold energy products, against the total energy value of all externally sold energy products (in MJ) (excluding purely traded volumes). GHG data that is part of OMV's 2030 and 2040 targets is subject to baseline recalculation; therefore, historical data has been recalculated. See Environmental Data for more details.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Our sustainability framework and \"net zero by 2050\" target were the basis for developing the business strategy 2030 approved by the Executive and Supervisory Boards in December 2021. The Group's decarbonization strategy is overseen by Group Sustainability and Strategic Planning & Projects.\n\nOur climate ambitions are at the heart of our strategy, and responsibility for meeting these ambitions is embedded at the highest levels. Our Executive Board is responsible for setting our climate targets and ensuring that our Group's business strategy is aligned with meeting these targets. Correspondingly, meeting our climate change targets is a part of executive remuneration, with GHG reduction targets included in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and in the annual bonus paid to the Executive Board.

In 2021, a Sustainability & Transformation Committee was established. Their purpose is to support the Company's Supervisory Board in\n\nreviewing and monitoring OMV's sustainability strategy, ESG-related standards, performance, and processes, and specifically our performance in HSSE and impact on climate change. Furthermore, the committee serves to support and oversee the transformation process toward a more sustainable business model, including the cultural integration of strategically significant acquisitions. For example, one of their responsibilities is to review and evaluate the progress we are making toward OMV's objectives in relation to our carbon footprint, climate change, and the energy transition.\n\nAt Group level, responsibility for GHG accounting and management, sustainability reporting, and ESG governance lies with the Group Sustainability team in Investor Relations & Sustainability, an area overseen by the CFO. OMV's Group Sustainability department is responsible for generating OMV's GHG inventory based on international standards and best practice. This team coordinates activities throughout the business, providing guidance to stakeholder groups such as subsidiaries, business units, and assets on GHG and energy-related topics. Low- and zerocarbon products enabling the energy transition are developed in the business units. Support for carbon impact assessments for new products is provided at Group level by the Group Sustainability department. To ensure\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nconsistency across the Group, there are also dedicated teams in OMV Petrom and Borealis.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team developed a Group-wide GHG Management Framework in 2022. This OMV Group regulation defines how to measure, report, and manage greenhouse gas emissions and contains the definitions, boundaries, and rules for the OMV Group's strategic GHG reduction targets and \"net zero by 2050\" ambition. It also defines the requirements for purchasing voluntary carbon offsets and their contribution to achieving the Group's GHG target.\n\nThe OMV Group's Capital Allocation Framework includes a strategic scoring methodology for investment projects based on four pillars: business strategic targets, financial metrics, risk profile, and climate targets impact. This new methodology was tested in 2022 in a pilot phase. The scoring helps to objectively define and review OMV's most important strategic projects and allows for holistic portfolio optimization across the OMV Group to support our strategy delivery, including our GHG reduction path. Climate scoring is an integral part of this overall scoring and covers the investment's impact on the OMV Group's Scope 1, 2, and 3 climate targets for 2030, as well as EU taxonomy relevance.\n\nAs part of the updated Capital Allocation Framework, OMV also introduced a new definition for \"sustainability CAPEX,\" which encompasses investments that meet one of two criteria: either they are aligned with the EU taxonomy or they are investments that support the implementation of OMV's 2030 Sustainability Framework. The goal of the new Capital Allocation Framework is to promote and facilitate investments in projects aligned with our climate targets, including our long-term net-zero target, rather than traditional fossil fuel-related investments. For more information, see Sustainability Governance.\n\n## Collaboration with Start-ups and Research Institutions\n\nEmissions reduction and sustainable energy solutions play a major role in our transformational path to meet society's energy needs. The OMV Group is leveraging its existing expertise and collaborating with start-ups and research institutions to find innovative technological solutions that will drive the energy transition and pave the way to becoming a net-zero company by 2050. Innovation is a key element in OMV's implementation of its Strategy 2030 and critical to the transformation of the value chain from a linear to a circular model. OMV is always looking for innovative solutions to optimize operations, evaluate business opportunities, and develop new business models to make OMV a sustainable company.\n\nThe complexities of the competing demand between climate action and the continued demand for energy highlights the importance of investment in innovation and technological advancement. Investments in unlimited, lowcarbon geothermal energy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and renewable power solutions play a key role in OMV's Strategy 2030. In 2023, the OMV Group entered into several partnerships, which include the following:\n\n- OMV acquired a 6.5% stake in the privately owned Canadian company Eavor Technologies Inc. Eavor is the world's leading developer of closed-loop geothermal energy solutions. In addition, OMV and Eavor entered into a commercial agreement to pursue large-scale deployments of the Eavor-Loop™ technology in Europe and beyond. Read more in Low- and Zero-Carbon Products.\n- OMV partnered with Plug and Play, which serves as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, connecting start-ups with corporate partners, investors, and resources. As a core element of the collaboration, OMV is actively engaged in Plug and Play's innovation program, which offers a structured and efficient pathway to discover, evaluate, and invest in a selected group of promising start-ups.\n- For the past four years, OMV has been part of the \"VERBUND X Accelerator.\" In 2023, OMV was a community partner, which gave the Company access to a vast network of idea generators and thought pioneers. This collaboration offered the opportunity to engage with start-ups and benefit from the innovative potential of the community. As part of the VERBUND X Accelerator program, OMV entered a strategic collaboration with the American start-up Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) in 2022. As a technology leader in separation solutions for low-carbon intensity processes, CMS has developed a potentially groundbreaking technology for carbon capture. Following an intensive research and testing phase, OMV will implement the technology and test it on an industrial scale.\n- OMV announced research funding of approximately USD 6 mn to research teams at Stanford University for the next five years. The funding builds on ten years of existing cooperation with the institute, marking a significant step forward for OMV in spearheading the creation of AI-driven tools aimed at ideating sustainable solutions. Among the notable achievements of this support is the development of a smart AI-based decision-making tool to optimize developments in the low-carbon business areas. It is capable of not only strategically positioning CO2 injectors, but also selecting the most effective monitoring techniques. This innovation is key in ensuring the highest level of safety in long-term CO2 storage.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- OMV started a collaboration with Hycamite, a Finnish start-up and a leader in emission-free pyrolysis technology. Through this collaboration, OMV will have access to a technology that will significantly aid the transition from our traditional business approach to a lower-carbon business model. The Hycamite technology breaks methane down into its component elements, hydrogen and carbon, without releasing any greenhouse gas emissions.\n- OMV developed and tested innovative technologies for Carbon Capture (CC), which will be tested in a pilot project in 2024. Together with Brusche Process Technology, a Dutch specialist in the design and construction of innovative sustainable process plants, a mobile carbon capture pilot plant is being built with the aim of testing these promising technologies for future application on a large scale at various OMV sites.\n\n## Low- and Zero-Carbon Products\n\nThe scale-up of zero-carbon and renewable energy product sales while reducing fossil fuel sales is central to reducing the carbon footprint of our energy supply. Zero-carbon and renewable energy products include biofuels, electricity, waste heat, and new energy products such as geothermal heat.\n\nIn our Energy division, the Low Carbon Business (LCB) team has been working on expanding our photovoltaic asset base. Based on our subsurface knowledge, capabilities, and asset base, we have also been exploring carbon capture and storage solutions. We collaborate with industry and research partners on these activities in line with applicable regulatory and legal requirements. We are also investigating solutions for subsurface energy storage, e.g., with hydrogen, and looking at options to explore and commercially develop geothermal energy potential in the countries where we operate. These projects are mainly in the R&D or initial investment phase.\n\nIn F&F, we are contributing to the creation of a sustainable energy system by identifying and maturing solutions, with a strong focus on markets that are hard to electrify using batteries and customer segments such as heavy road transport or air travel. What these markets have in common is that they need an energy-dense yet climatefriendly fuel with the lowest possible downtime. Our portfolio focuses on waste-based and advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and e-fuels, as these offer the potential to utilize synergies with existing refinery assets and competences for a feasible scale-up and roll-out of green technologies.\n\nThe successful implementation of all these projects will reduce our absolute emissions, create green, innovative products and services for society, and provide a key differentiator for OMV.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has defined sustainability criteria that influence which projects and technologies are selected for investment. For all investments and M&A activities, it should be ensured that all climate-related risks are identified, assessed, and evaluated. This will include the assessment of the actual and forecast carbon footprint of the respective investment and M&A. Projects that contribute positively to the achievement of OMV's climate targets are preferred for investment (for more details, see Sustainability Governance). All project ideas selected for maturing need to demonstrate a feasible trajectory from pilot and demo stage to full industrial scale in the medium term.\n\n#### **Responsible Biofuels Sourcing**\n\nAll biofuels purchased by OMV in 2023 and used for blending meet the requirements of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Since 2013, the ISCC EU certificate issued for OMV Downstream GmbH has been renewed on an annual basis. OMV Petrom, OMV Hungary, OMV Czech Republic, OMV Germany, and OMV Slovakia are also certified according to the ISCC EU standard.\n\n#### **Biofuel Volumes**<sup>13</sup>\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/14 description: The image is a bar chart comparing the production of FAME, Ethanol, and HVO in megaliters for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. For FAME, the production in 2021 was 409 megaliters, in 2022 it was 351 megaliters, and in 2023 it was 351 megaliters. For Ethanol, the production in 2021 was 137 megaliters, in 2022 it was 137 megaliters, and in 2023 it was 163 megaliters. For HVO, the production in 2021 was 14 megaliters, in 2022 it was 14 megaliters, and in 2023 it was 30 megaliters.\n\nOMV purchases biofuels mainly from European producers and excludes palm oil as a feedstock. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards require that no deforestation took place from January 2008 onward for any feedstock that is used for biodiesel generation. Since July 2021, OMV has also complied with the Austrian legal requirement not to use palm-oil-based biofuels for target fulfillment. In 2023, of all biofuels placed on the market by OMV, only around 0.3% were based on palm oil. The main feedstocks used are used cooking oil (30%), rapeseed oil (29%), and corn (13%).\n\nOMV plans to use vegetable oils and used cooking oil as well as other potential waste and advanced feedstock to produce biofuels using our Co-Processing technology. Co-Processing involves introducing biogenic feedstock during the fuel refining process instead of the conventional method of blending biogenic components into fuel after production.\n\n2023 figure estimated as both Austria and Germany data are based on year-to-date actuals plus a forecast for the remaining months each year, given that the annual deadline for closing all biofuel balances of a given year is not before the publication of the Sustainability Report. 13\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThis concept allows OMV's existing refineries to produce transportation fuels from various types of biogenic feedstock.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, OMV successfully conducted the first field trials of Co-Processing at the Schwechat refinery using rapeseed oil, and obtained certification in accordance with the REDcert standard, an EU-recognized system for the certification of sustainable biomass. In 2020, another field trial was successfully completed at the Petrobrazi refinery. OMV continues to implement the Co-Processing technology and in 2024, the Company aims to start the co-processing of sustainable feedstock in Schwechat. It is important to note that no palm oil will be co-processed. The project will start with a mix of vegetable oils (rapeseed oil and sunflower oil). It may include some other waste and residue or advanced streams like used cooking oil or cashew nutshell liquid in future (2024–2025). In December 2020, OMV committed to investing EUR 200 mn in the construction of the Co-Processing unit at the Schwechat refinery. Utilizing this process will lead to an annual reduction of OMV's carbon footprint of up to 360 kt CO2, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of around 200,000 cars driving an average of 12,000 km per year.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Geothermal Energy**\n\nOMV and Wien Energie are joining forces to deliver the heating transition. In a joint venture called \"deeep,\" the two companies are working closely to make deep geothermal energy a reality in the greater Vienna area. The aim is to develop deep geothermal plants with an output of up to 200 MW, thereby generating climate-neutral district heating for the equivalent of up to 200,000 Viennese households. The partners are also planning to implement up to seven deep geothermal plants in Vienna as part of drilling programs. The first deep geothermal plant is to be realized together by the partners in the joint venture. The plant will generate up to 20 MW of climate-neutral district heating – in combination with heat pumps from Wien Energie. The aim is to supply up to 20,000 Viennese households with district heating from this plant. Approval procedures are currently underway and drilling is due to start toward the end of 2024. The plant is scheduled to go into operation in 2027. Making the project part of the joint venture allows the partners to glean valuable insights and data for follow-up projects, enabling Wien Energie and OMV to realize the further expansion of geothermal energy in Vienna more quickly and efficiently.\n\nOMV acquired a 6.5% stake in Canadian privately owned Eavor Technologies Inc. for the amount of EUR 34 mn. Eavor is the leading closed-loop geothermal energy solution\n\ndeveloper worldwide. In addition, OMV and Eavor have entered into a commercial agreement to pursue large-scale deployments of Eavor-Loop™ technology in Europe and beyond. The commercial agreement establishes OMV as a key partner with preferred licensing terms, access to services, and development support. OMV's initial focus will be on the deployment of Eavor-Loop™ in Austria and Germany. Eavor's technology is based on a closed-loop system, installed in deep subsurface rock, whereby a working fluid is circulated between surface and deep subsurface rock in a closed loop and therefore heated up. The technology reduces the geological and hence operational risk significantly compared to normal hydrothermal systems with similar energy output. As Eavor-Loop™ is truly scalable and applicable in various types of geological structures, it will enable OMV to offer heat solutions for district heating networks outside of the normal hydrothermal areas and therefore complement its existing portfolio of hydrothermal projects.\n\nOMV is constantly evaluating and maturing further opportunities and projects with regards to open- and closed-loop geothermal.\n\n#### **Renewable Energy**\n\nOMV Petrom and Complexul Energetic (CE) Oltenia will begin the construction of four solar parks, which will provide a combined capacity of approximately 450 MW. The total investment required for the establishment of these four photovoltaic parks exceeds EUR 400 mn, with 70% of the funding coming from the Modernization Fund. The PV parks will be built in Ișalnița, Tismana, Roșia and Rovinari, on the sites of the former mining operations managed by CE Oltenia. Based on current estimates, the PV parks should supply electricity to the national energy system from 2024 onward. In addition, OMV Petrom has signed an agreement to acquire a number of projects for the construction of solar parks in Teleorman county. The projects will go into the execution phase by the second quarter of 2024 and, with a total power output of 710 MW, will supply enough power for 280,000 Romanian households annually.\n\n#### **Glycerin2Propanol**\n\nAfter seven years of successful development within OMV, the implementation of the Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant at the Schwechat refinery site marks a significant step toward advancing the technology maturity (barrel/hour scale; TRL 6–7). In October 2023, important milestones were reached with the delivery of the last modules and placement on the foundation. The final assembly of the Glycerin2Propanol plant is now underway, with only a few stages left before mechanical completion. The OMV-patented technology will produce propanol from low-value material crude glycerin by the end of Q1 2024. The plant will use a catalyst, or reaction accelerator, developed in-house by OMV to transform the biogenic waste-based crude glycerin into a so-\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is simple, with a triangular roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also blue and appears to be a thin line.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer, the second is a left arrow, and the third is a right arrow.\n\ncalled advanced bioalcohol (propanol). In doing so, the plant will generate what are known as advanced biofuels, which are not in competition with foodstuffs and which, when added to gasoline, reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nWhile glycerin is a waste/by-product of the production of biodiesel and the manufacture of detergents and soaps, it is also considered an advanced biobased feedstock under the European Union's RED III Renewable Energy Directive. This means that the feedstock is not part of the food chain and does not compete for land use for food. The propanol produced in this way will then be used as an advanced bioadditive for gasoline. It can also be used as a sustainable feedstock for the chemicals market to replace fossilfuel-based propanol. OMV is set to invest around EUR 30 mn in the scale-up of this project, of which around EUR 8 mn will be funded through the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft; FFG) and the COVID-19 premium. The capacity of the pilot plant will be 1.25 mn l of propanol per year. This will lead to a CO2 reduction of around 1,800 t annually. A total of 1.2 l of crude glycerin is needed to produce 1 l of propanol. Under moderate temperature and pressure, 1 barrel (159 liters) of propanol will be produced per hour in an energy-efficient process. The long-term plan is to commercialize the technology to produce around 125 mn l of propanol per year and reduce CO2 emissions by around 180 kt. The Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant will be located at the Schwechat refinery alongside the ReOil® plant so that both units can take advantage of a combined operator station, exploiting the synergy of a shared operator concept. In addition to this unique in-house development, we also partner with technology providers to develop viable business projects for transforming biomass from agriculture, municipalities, the paper industry, or wood processing into bioliquids to be used for greener fuels and chemicals.\n\nProject commissioning is scheduled for March 2024 after finalizing integration with IT systems and preparing operation manuals.\n\n#### **Hydrogen**\n\nTogether with our partner Kommunalkredit Austria AG, in February 2021, we announced a joint investment in the construction of Austria's largest electrolysis plant at our Schwechat refinery. Construction work started on this project in August 2022. Total investment will be around EUR 25 mn, with OMV and Kommunalkredit each bearing half the cost. The plant is expected to go live in the first half of 2024. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis system will produce up to 1,500 t of green hydrogen per year. The green hydrogen will be used to hydrogenate biobased and fossil fuels, substituting gray hydrogen in the refinery. This would reduce OMV's carbon footprint by up to 15 kta of fossil CO2. On global wind day on June 15, 2023, a new milestone was accomplished where the first wind turbine assigned to OMV in Dürnkrut, Weinviertel was inaugurated. This wind turbine was built and is operated by our partner, the W.E.B. energy company. The wind turbine has a capacity of 5.6 MW and generates 13.7 GWh of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the annual consumption of 4,000 households. It will cover about 20% of the renewable energy needed for the 10 MW electrolysis plant in Schwechat.\n\n#### **Sustainable Aviation Fuels**\n\nWith the innovative aviation fuel known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), we're driving the transition to a climate-friendly future. Because by also processing waste food oil from around the region, CO2 emissions can be cut by more than 80% compared with conventional kerosene products. SAF is thus a viable alternative and already in use today.\n\nOMV has initiated a broad investment portfolio to produce sustainable fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). Mandated blending targets for both road fuels (HVO) and the aviation sector (SAF) are planned, with financial penalties for noncompliance. OMV is aiming to produce both SAF and HVO in a flexible product yield range, depending on market needs. Investments in new units and unit revamps are under development for the refineries in Austria, Romania, and Germany, as well as in new assets beyond the current refineries.\n\nAnother focus topic is the hard to electrify area of e-fuels, another core building block of OMV's SAF portfolio, which shows great potential for enabling climate-friendly air travel. While in theory the concept is simple, i.e., hydrogen produced with renewable electricity is combined with CO2, the production technology is still in the demonstration phase and requires further research and development for the required industrial scaling.\n\nOMV is leading a project consortium together with industrial partners like BASF and thyssenkrupp Uhde, and academia (e.g., the German Aerospace Centre DLR and ASG Analytik-Service Gesellschaft) to develop a process to produce SAF based on methanol (M2SAF project). In addition to catalyst development, process development, plant integration, and the design of a demo plant, the project also includes techno-economic and -ecological analysis, as well as accompanying support for the certification and analysis of the new aviation fuels. The project is also targeting the production of a 100% drop-in capable SAF and enabling a process route with high selectivity and minimal additional CO2 emissions, and with a high degree of integrability into existing brownfield or greenfield installations. The starting point of the process is sustainably produced methanol, either from CO2 and hydrogen or from biogenic feedstock. The development project started in August 2022 for an initial period of 2.5 years\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nand is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV).\n\nOMV was already delivering SAFs to Air France-KLM, Ryanair, and Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG Fuels) at Vienna airport in 2023. Additional Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for the intended offtake of SAFs were signed with Air France-KLM and Ryanair in 2023. Volumes covered by MoUs between 2023 and 2030 are: up to 160,000 t for Ryanair, up to 155,000 t for Wizz Air, up to 200,000 t for Air France-KLM, and more than 800,000 t for the Lufthansa Group.\n\n#### **Retail 2023**\n\nMobility is changing fast – countries in the EU have released climate and energy strategies, aiming for a carbon-free\n\n#### **Retail 2023**\n\nenergy sector by 2050. The vision addresses all energy sectors; mobility is being presented as a flagship sector to showcase sustainable development. To adapt to these trends, OMV is developing an EV fast-charging network.\n\nOMV is investing over EUR 400 mn in delivering superior EV charging services for drivers and businesses. Our objective is to offer at least 2,000 e-charging points at highway and transit route filling stations, plus around 17,000 office wall-box charging points by 2030. The implementation includes the installation of charging points in Austria, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary to offer highpower chargers, with the majority featuring a charging capacity between 150 kW and 300 kW. In 2023, an additional 272 charging points were installed.\n\nImage /page/64/Figure/10 description: This image shows a map of Europe with the number of filling stations, hydrogen filling stations, and e-charging points in each country. The map includes countries such as Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Serbia, and Bulgaria. The number of filling stations is shown in a white circle with a blue outline, the number of hydrogen filling stations is shown in a green circle, and the number of e-charging points is shown in an orange circle. The total number of filling stations is 1,666, the total number of hydrogen filling stations is 5, and the total number of e-charging points is 276. The number of filling stations in each country is as follows: Czech Republic (138), Slovakia (104), Austria (437), Hungary (207), Romania (555), Moldova (69), Serbia (63), and Bulgaria (93). The number of hydrogen filling stations in Austria is 5. The number of e-charging points in each country is as follows: Czech Republic (28), Slovakia (4), Austria (106), Hungary (22), Romania (120), and Austria (4).\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\n- In the coming years, we will focus on implementing the investment projects mentioned (e.g., Glycerin2Propanol). In Q3 2024 and subsequently to commissioning and start-up, vigorous test runs will be conducted according to a dedicated parameter matrix to further optimize the operating window of the Glycerin2Propanol process, and data will be gathered in parallel for subsequent industrial scale commercialization. Moreover, ISCC EU certification is planned for the Glycerin2Propanol pilot plant.\n- In addition, we will mature project ideas in the areas of advanced biofuels and e-fuels. By 2030, we aim to produce and market at least 700 kta of sustainable aviation fuels. OMV will also expand its capabilities to take advantage of the growth in electric vehicle charging. By investing more than EUR 400 mn by 2030, OMV will offer more than 2,000 electric charging points at highway and transit route filling stations, plus around 17,000 office wall-box charging points. In addition, following the MoU signed by the OMV Group and Austrian Post in 2021 for the use of green hydrogen in heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), the first use of green hydrogen is expected in 2023 at the latest. By 2030, 2,000 HGVs will be powered by green hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/1 description: The image contains three icons. The first icon is a print icon inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n- For the Glycerin2Propanol project, the factory acceptance test was completed in Q2 2023 and the pilot plant modules have been transported to the Schwechat refinery for reassembly, loop checks, and final commissioning by the end of 2024's first quarter. In parallel and as a precondition for the bulk chemical market, the propanol from OMV's biobased process has been registered at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) – OMV being the first company to register propanol produced from a renewable basis. Looking to the future, collaborative R&D efforts have begun to transform the propanol into sustainable aviation fuel.\n- Investments of approximately EUR 5 bn have been planned between now and 2030 to build the Low Carbon Business (LCB) in our Energy division, with a focus on geothermal energy, CCS, and renewable power. The investments are expected to ramp up after 2024. The LCB team has been working on expanding our renewables asset base with a focus on captive use within the OMV Group. Furthermore, we are looking at opportunities and projects to explore and commercially develop the geothermal energy potential via open- and closed-loop systems. For CCS, we are working on further license applications and opportunities.\n\n## Neutralization Measures\n\nWe aim to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero by 2050 at the latest. While the biggest drivers on this journey will be decreasing our fossil fuel sales and increasing our zerocarbon product sales, we also recognize that neutralization measures will be necessary. Neutralization measures include, but are not limited to, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). By 2030, we aim to establish CCS capacities of around 5 mn t per year as our main neutralization measure toward achieving our targets.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Offsetting Emissions**\n\nOMV offers voluntary carbon offsetting to customers and works closely with ClimatePartner, an internationally trusted service partner based in Munich. ClimatePartner selects certified carbon offset projects and ensures that OMV customers who use this option are able to contribute a dedicated amount to these projects. The criteria for these carbon offset credits to be used for voluntary offsetting are clearly defined in OMV's GHG Management Framework. In 2023, the biggest contributors in terms of CO2 offsets in OMV's portfolio were wind and solar energy projects in India and China, and forest protection in Brazil. In 2023, the climate protection projects used for CO2 offsetting consisted of: hydropower projects (14.38%) in Bulgaria, Turkey, India, and China; solar projects (9.13%) in China and India; wind energy projects (46.26%) in Bulgaria, Turkey, China, and India; nature-based projects\n\n(18.35%) in Rumania and Brazil; gas/heat recovery and biogas projects (11.9%) in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Pakistan. These carbon offsets are verified according to one or more of the following internationally recognized standards: Gold Standard (GS), Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Certified Emission Reductions (CER), and Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standard (CCBS).\n\nNone of these voluntary carbon offsets have been accounted to contribute toward achieving OMV's GHG reduction target.\n\n#### **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Utilization (CCU)**\n\nIn line with the aim of becoming a net-zero company, OMV will invest in carbon capture and storage (CCS), leveraging existing assets and capabilities, and contribute to a more sustainable society.\n\nIn order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, OMV Energy will invest around EUR 5 bn in the development of lowcarbon businesses, i.e., geothermal energy, renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS). For CCS, we intend to offset absolute emissions both from captive use and third parties. The target for 2030 is to grow to 5 mn metric t a year. We will explore CCS solutions based on our subsurface knowledge, capabilities, and asset base. In addition to the license that we hold together with Aker BP, we are working on further license applications and opportunities in this area. We collaborate on these activities in line with applicable regulatory and legal requirements in conjunction with industry and research partners.\n\nOMV aims to capture CO2 and ideally use it as a resource. Carbon capture and utilization technologies, such as capturing biogenic CO2 emissions, hydrating the CO2, and then reusing it as a chemical or aviation fuel, are crucial to reducing overall atmospheric emissions and fostering circularity. However, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement does not just require reducing our own emissions but also helping reduce atmospheric emissions from other sources. Thus, our CCS and CCU projects include, but are not limited to, capturing our own emissions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**327 kt CO2e** of customer-related GHG emissions voluntarily offset by verified carbon credits\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- Currently, OMV's customers can voluntarily offset the carbon footprint resulting from using all products they purchase from us, such as diesel, gasoline, bitumen, heating oil, and natural gas. OMV GAS offers this service in all markets. We recognize the high and ever-increasing customer demand for this option. OMV Fuels Sales customers can voluntarily offset their carbon footprint based on the use of gasoline or diesel, as well as extra-light heating oil and bitumen, in all countries where we operate. Customers of OMV Retail Mobility & Convenience (our filling stations) are able to offset 20% of the carbon footprint when opting for MaxxMotion Performance Fuels in Austria, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary, without any surcharge. Our OMV Card customers can use their OMV Card with the Routex function to offset the carbon footprint of the diesel and gasoline they purchase.\n- Aker BP and OMV (Norge) AS have entered into a collaboration agreement for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and been awarded a license for CO2 storage in accordance with the CO2 Storage Regulations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The license awarded to Aker BP and OMV is located in the Norwegian North Sea and is named Poseidon. Aker BP (50%) and OMV (Norge) AS (50%) have interest in the license, which will be operated by Aker BP. The license comes with a work program that includes a 3D seismic acquisition and a drill or drop decision by 2025. The Poseidon license could potentially provide storage of more than 5 mn t of CO2 per year. The intention is to inject CO2 captured from multiple identified industrial emitters in northwest Europe, including from Borealis' various industrial sites in Europe.\n\nBorealis entered into a collaboration with the University of Helsinki, Finland, as well as several other academic and industry partners, on a joint research project focusing on direct carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from the air. This project is part of the Business Finland-funded SPIRIT Program (Sustainable Plastics Industry Transformation). Co-founded by Borealis, the program seeks to bring about a circular and net zero transformation of the plastics value chain.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our strategy, we foresee developing CCS storage capacity of around 5 mn t per year CO2 net at OMV by 2030. In addition, OMV Petrom will test an innovative technology for CCU at the Petrobrazi refinery. OMV Petrom is a partner in an ambitious European project to address the problem of CO2 emissions through carbon capture and conversion technologies. Over a five-month period in 2024, they will capture the CO2 from flue gasses released by the cogeneration unit, further converting them electrochemically into a marketable product.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a blue circle.

In the foreground, there is a circular logo with a blue background and a white graphic of a plant growing from the soil, with arrows forming a recycling symbol around it.\n\n## Natural Resources Management\n\nOur impact on the environment – and responsibility to act – extends beyond our greenhouse gas emissions. As an oil, gas, and chemicals company, OMV's environmental footprint is significant due to its water use, environmental degradation caused by spills, biodiversity impacts, and waste. However, we also have the technological know-how to present solutions to reduce this impact, in particular by fostering the circular economy. In contrast to the linear \"take-make-waste\" model, which will lead to more plastic waste and environmental pollution while putting pressure on the planet's limited resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design and aims to decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources.\n\nOMV is fully committed to taking action when it comes to responsible natural resources management and is proactively expediting the transition from a linear to a circular economy. OMV aims to minimize environmental impacts by preventing water and soil pollution, reducing emissions, using natural resources efficiently, and avoiding the disruption of biodiversity.\n\nThe Natural Resources Management strategic focus area combines our commitments and actions relating to environmental preservation under one umbrella. The first step is to manage our operational footprint, as described in the Environment section below. The Circular Economy material topic then describes the strategies and technologies we are applying to recover and reuse by-products or waste to make new materials and products, resulting in a cleaner environment.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

From left to right, they are: SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) depicted with a heartbeat line and a heart; SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) represented by a glass of water with a drop falling into it; SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) symbolized by an infinity loop; SDG 14 (Life Below Water) illustrated with a fish swimming in wavy water; and SDG 15 (Life on Land) showing a tree and birds in a natural landscape.\n\nOMV aims to protect people and nature through measures such as preventing water and soil pollution. OMV is liable for the impact that our activities have on the environment. Breaching environmental regulations on a local, national, and international level would result in both financial losses and harm to our reputation. Our license to operate depends on compliance with regulations relating to environmental protection, which is also of particular importance to governmental authorities, shareholders, and stakeholders such as the public and environmental NGOs and NPOs. OMV's Code of Conduct and HSSE Policy formalize our public commitments to safeguarding the environment.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/16 description: The image shows a circular blue icon with a white outline.

In 2020, the EM Standard was revised and minimum requirements on odor emissions were established. In 2021, the EM Standard was revised again, following which minimum requirements on H2S in vented gas and the design of the environmental processes to complement the implementation of the EM Standard were added. The review in 2022 resulted in the addition of two new annexes on a Water Management Plan Framework and Water Management Plan Template.\n\nBefore undertaking new operational activities or entering new countries, environmental risk assessments are performed, including evaluations of local legislation, the potential impact of our activities on sensitive and protected areas, and the effects on endangered species. Each subsequent phase of project implementation is accompanied by a detailed assessment of environmental risks.\n\nThe framework and methodology for our coordinated Groupwide Environmental Risk Assessment are based on best practice standards, which meet the ISO 14001 requirements and ensure the consistent qualitative assessment of operational risks and impacts related to the environment.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard furthermore defines the process of carrying out Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), mainly for projects. Preventive and mitigation measures and the monitoring program to ensure implementation of the proposed measures are documented in an Environmental and Social Management Plan. The final ESIA report is submitted to the local regulator or lender (whichever is applicable) for review, public disclosure, and approval.\n\n#### **52%** of sites certified to ISO 14001\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires that all relevant OMV businesses and activities (including investment, acquisitions, and divestment) implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) consistent with ISO 14001 and adhering to the minimum requirements listed. All relevant OMV businesses are required to review and update the EMS at least once per year, while a full EMS audit must be carried out either by an external independent auditor or OMV corporate environmental experts every three years for sites not certified to ISO 14001. Internal EMS audits are performed regularly and as necessary at local level to assess whether the guidelines in the EMS are being followed and to identify improvement measures.\n\nIn 2023, the utilization rate of the European refineries increased by 12% to 85% (2022: 73%), as the first half of the previous year was impacted by the turnaround and incident at the Schwechat refinery. The turnaround at the Petrobrazi refinery and the petrochemicals turnaround in Schwechat had a negative impact on the utilization rate in 2023. 14\n\nSeveral UN SDG subtargets were initially designated to be reached by 2020. However, sources such as the UN's Global Biodiversity Outlook state that goals related to nature have not been met. OMV still considers the attainment of these goals relevant past the year 2020, and thus still links these SDG subtargets to its strategic targets. 15\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThere is a high degree of interdependence between the Environment material topic and the material topics Health, Safety, and Well-Being, and Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience. Thus, these distinct material topics are governed centrally by Group HSSE. The OMV Group HSSE department is organized into specialized teams with experienced experts in areas such as:\n\n- Development and implementation of OMV's HSSE strategy, regulations, and processes\n- HSSE risk assessment\n- Incident investigation\n- HSSE data analysis and reporting\n- Environmental management\n- Process safety management\n- Security and resilience management\n\nGroup HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. There are HSSE departments at OMV Petrom and Borealis, which oversee their specific issues and coordinate their local HSSE officers and experts. The OMV Petrom and Borealis HSSE departments report functionally to the VP HSSE at Group level.\n\nEnvironmental awareness is promoted across the Group through various activities. For instance, regular exchanges on Environmental Management are held, where environmental experts and interested colleagues Group-wide can learn about the best practices being implemented at other sites and gain inspiration. At OMV Petrom, a contest to highlight key initiatives in the company was again held in 2023, with winners receiving awards from the OMV Petrom Executive Board.\n\n#### Strategy Update\n\nAs the OMV Group fundamentally updated its transformational business strategy in 2022, a major review of the HSSE Strategy 2025 led to the updated HSSE Strategy 2030. As pressure on the planetary boundaries continues to increase and substantial changes in the regulatory environment are taking place, environmental management will need a stronger and updated strategic focus in the coming years. More information on the strategy update can be found in Health, Safety, and Security.\n\n#### Water\n\nOMV uses significant amounts of water for its operations in its upstream and downstream activities. Freshwater is used for processes such as drilling, steam generation, and cooling, among others. Smaller amounts of water are also used for non-industrial purposes. Any water produced is treated for reinjection into pressurized hydrocarbon reservoirs to optimize the extraction rate. Desalinated water is used in some offshore operations. Refineries and various other operating facilities also use brackish and/or recycled water for various operational purposes. Some of OMV's operating facilities are located in water stress areas.<sup>16</sup>\n\n#### **Freshwater Withdrawn**<sup>17</sup>\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/19 description: The image is a bar graph showing freshwater withdrawn in megaliters from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, 39,251 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 185 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2020, 38,628 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 283 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2021, 333,247 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 348 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2022, 279,983 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 456 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress. In 2023, 154,573 megaliters of freshwater were withdrawn, and 1,525 megaliters were withdrawn from all areas with water stress.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur Water Ambition Statement is OMV's public commitment to water management, and states the following:\n\n- We respect water as a precious limited resource and focus on its sustainable use.\n- We are committed to meeting all applicable legislative requirements or our own OMV regulations, whichever are more stringent.\n- Water management is a key component of our social license to operate. We cooperate with local communities and prove to be responsible partners.\n- We are committed to transparency when it comes to our impact on water resources.\n- Every OMV employee is responsible for minimizing the impact of our activities on water resources.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard requires all OMV businesses and activities to minimize the impact of effluent on the environment and on local communities and outlines specific requirements for wastewater discharge onshore and offshore. The direct discharge of wastewater on land, in wetlands, or in other bodies of water without prior treatment is not permitted. No discharge may alter or diminish the value of the receiving environment. Based on the national legislation and permits, all discharge must be systematically monitored, and any environmental impact must be managed appropriately. Local regulatory and river basin authorities are involved to ensure that OMV complies with local envi-\n\nAreas of water stress are areas where the demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period, or when poor quality restricts its use. In such areas, water stress causes deterioration of freshwater resources in terms of quantity (aquifer overexploitation, dry rivers, etc.) and quality (eutrophication, organic matter pollution, saline intrusion, etc.). Source: [European Environmental Agency.](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) 16\n\n<sup>17</sup> The decrease in freshwater withdrawn in 2023 vs. 2022 is due to the divestment of Borealis Nitro in 2023. The majority of freshwater withdrawn at Borealis is oncethrough cooling water, meaning it is discharged to the environment in its original quality, only with a very slightly elevated temperature. See [European Environmental](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) [Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/glossary) for details.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard was updated in 2022, with key additions being new annexes for the development and implementation of Water Management Plans.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV's Group-wide Water Strategy was drafted in 2014 and is based on five strategic pillars: transparency, risks and opportunities, water efficiency and treatment, training and awareness, and stakeholder engagement.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nHigh-level water stress assessments are conducted annually. In order to identify operations in areas affected by water scarcity and water stress, OMV uses international tools and indexes such as the Verisk Maplecroft Water Stress Index complemented by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Baseline Water Stress Index, and its own assessments as required. Some regions where OMV operates have already experienced water stress in dry years and a further decline in water availability is expected, mainly due to climate change.\n\nA bottom-up approach in the assessment of water-related risks is followed in accordance with OMV's Group-wide Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) guideline to ensure consistent qualitative assessments of operational risks and impacts related to the environment, including water. Significant risks are integrated into OMV's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) system. When entering a new country or considering new operational activities, OMV primarily uses the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tools and Verisk Maplecroft indices to identify future potential water-related constraints, such as baseline water stress, groundwater stress, and seasonal variability.\n\nWater management-related risks are closely linked with the topic of spill prevention. Offshore operations may lead to oil spills that have a significant impact on marine water resources and ecosystems. The response strategy aims to minimize the probability of such risks and maximize preparedness so that we can provide timely remediation measures in the unlikely event of an oil spill. OMV allocates significant resources to prevention and mitigation measures. Read more about spill prevention in the section [Spills](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2022/focus-areas/natural-resources-management/environment/spills.html). Any new or existing offshore drilling activity is accompanied by a third-party analysis evaluating the magnitude of a potential major event and its possible consequences. As part of the biannual Group-wide EWRM process, water-related risks and mitigation measures are assessed in a larger strategic context, while a systematic approach is taken in day-to-day operations to monitor and manage high-impact/low-probability risks, such as blowouts during offshore drilling.\n\n#### **Water Management Plans**\n\nWater Management Plans are an effective tool for addressing all water-related topics, issues, and tasks, with the aim of improving water management performance. They provide information about current water uses and chart a course for water efficiency improvements, conservation activities, and water reduction goals.\n\nEvery location in the OMV Group must develop, implement, and maintain a Water Management Plan, which should include at least the following elements:\n\n- Scope and objectives including site description\n- Applicable legislation, other requirements, and permits\n- Identification of water sources, discharges including water quality parameters, and monitoring plans\n- Water map, inventory, and balance including discharges\n- Water transport, storage, and treatment systems\n- Significant water-related risks and mitigation measures\n- Water conservation and water efficiency measures including an action plan\n\nOperating facilities located in places that are affected or are likely to be affected by water scarcity issues, and operations utilizing significant water resources (e.g., Tunisia) are prioritized when developing and implementing Water Management Plans. These plans aim to allow sustainable long-term production with minimal effects on the environment.\n\n#### **Best Available Technologies**\n\nWe implement measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal to a minimum. These include: reduction of operational complexity, water recirculation (e.g., at CCPP Brazi), upgrade of equipment (boilers), maintenance of equipment to reduce water loss, replacement of water cooling systems with air coolers (for example, the C3+ fraction recovery plant from Petromar), the use of desalinated seawater rather than freshwater, the installation of recirculating cooling systems, the use of air or glycol as a cooling agent instead of water (e.g., at Oltenia's 2 Bustuchin compressor station asset), and optimization of pipeline routes for water supply. In addition to implementing measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal, we implement the Best Available Technology (BAT) to sustainably treat water.\n\n#### **Stakeholder Engagement**\n\nOur impact on water resources is important to various stakeholders. We engage with government authorities, such as river basin management authorities, on compli-\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/1 description: The image shows three icons in a horizontal row. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside a circle. All icons are blue.\n\nance with water use rules and environmental parameters relating to any wastewater generated. We also engage with local water utility companies to discuss the supply of freshwater for OMV operations and the treatment of wastewater. We additionally work with NGOs on environmental preservation and water resource conservation, as well as with local communities on the sharing of local water resources and the quality of discharged wastewater. For instance, in Austria, there are local fisherpersons who fish the Danube in Schwechat, close to both the refinery and the Lobau Tank Farm, and in the harbor there, with whom we have maintained an active and open dialogue for several years. In areas where OMV operations require large amounts of water, or areas that suffer from water stress, it is particularly important to include local stakeholders in water management activities to secure a \"social license to operate.\" OMV's water management activities pursue socially equitable water use, and OMV regularly carries out supplier audits to ensure compliance with our human rights requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the interests of local communities are known and taken into account during the project life cycle, OMV conducts social baseline studies and community needs assessments as part of Social Impact Assessments (SIAs). If these assessments identify the need, OMV launches community projects aimed at increasing access to clean water for local communities. Our Community Grievance Mechanisms also enable communities to raise concerns about water-related issues. For more information, see Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\nWater Management Plans completed for **68%** of priority sites\n\n**1%** of freshwater withdrawal is in water scarce areas\n\n**0.012 mg/l** dispersed oil concentration in discharged water\n\nWater Management Plans have been completed for 68% of priority sites, with the development of plans in progress at the remaining sites. All plans are developed according to the new annexes of the OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard.\n\n- At OMV Tunisia, we implemented improvement projects to reduce freshwater use and increase the safe reuse of wastewater. To reduce freshwater use at the buffer firewater pit, we modified the outlet of our reverse osmosis unit and now use lower-quality retentate water for refilling instead of the previously used higher-quality well water. In order to safely reuse wastewater, we implemented downstream enhancements to the existing sewage water unit by installing additional sand filters and UV disinfection to act on pathogenic bacteria. This has enabled wider water reuse for the green zone irrigation and extension.\n- In 2023, Borealis put a new wastewater treatment plant in Stenungsund into operation. The new wastewater treatment unit is designed according to the BAT for this purpose and fulfills all legal requirements from the Swedish authorities. A new and modern wastewater treatment unit will improve the environmental performance of the cracker plant and reduce the environmental impact on the surroundings. The new wastewater treatment unit will reduce the emission of contaminants to the Baltic Sea and will also minimize VOC emissions to the air, since all treatment steps are covered and enclosed. The new unit includes buffering in two tanks and physical and chemical treatment of the water in dissolved nitrogen flotation units. The off-gas from the different steps will be treated by adsorption in carbon filters.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our Sustainability Strategy 2025, we aim to reduce freshwater use. As a next step, we plan to establish quantitative targets to improve water management. Over the coming years, the aim is for all operated OMV Group sites to have finalized and implemented their Water Management Plans.\n\n### Spills\n\nOil spills<sup>18</sup> are a critical environmental issue for our industry. Spill management is defined as the prevention of spills in operations and those caused by incidents such as sabotage or natural hazards, and the management and remediation of spills resulting from an incident. Our key commitment is to prevent spills from happening in the first place. If they do occur, we aim to reduce their impact through appropriate and fast oil spill response and clean-up.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups are affected by our spill management activities. Government authorities are involved through potential breaches of environmental regulations, while employees and contractors are impacted by potential health and safety issues arising from accidents and damage to the environment and society. NGOs/NPOs are interested in potential damage to the environment and society, society may suffer as a result of damage to the\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

For our subsidiary Borealis, preventing pellet spills is also a key issue. Borealis is committed to achieving zero pellet loss in and around its operations, during transportation, and across the entire value chain. The company was therefore an early signatory to Operation Clean Sweep® (OCS), an international program initiated by the Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council and rolled out in Europe by Plastics Europe. Borealis is also a signatory of the Zero Pellet Loss pact in Austria, which is the Austrian equivalent of OCS. Achieving zero pellet loss is an ongoing journey and requires leadership, effort, investment, and targeted and effective work practices. The following section will discuss our management of oil spills. Read more about our efforts on pellet spills in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/about-us/debt-investor-relations/results-and-reports)\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nWe aim to prevent and reduce oil spills and leakage in our operations at sea as well as on land. Appropriate spill prevention and control plans that account for specific business conditions have been put in place and are summarized in the Spill Preparedness and Response Planning annex of our Environmental Standard. These include proactive management plans comprising risk assessments, preventive measures, and inspections, as well as reactive management plans comprising control, response, and clean-up procedures. The majority of our oil spills involve OMV Petrom's Exploration & Production division, where we concentrate our efforts on safeguarding and maintaining our infrastructure and improving the reliability of our facilities.\n\n#### **Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments**\n\nWe have a Well Integrity Management System (WIMS) in place covering all active wells operated by OMV. WIMS enables a uniform and structured approach for describing, documenting, and reporting the status of the well integrity throughout the production phase of a well in a predefined operating envelope. WIMS therefore ensures that we operate our wells safely for people and the environment. OMV's Energy division has also developed a Corrosion Management Framework (CMF) to provide a proactive and consistent approach to corrosion monitoring and management across the entire division. Covering the full life cycle of the equipment exposed to the risk of corrosion in both oil and gas facilities, from the well to the sales point, this framework encompasses the entire value chain of our business. A team of dedicated in-house experts with multidisciplinary and multicultural backgrounds is working to embed CMF principles into everyday operations.\n\n#### **Emergency Response and Contingency Plans**\n\nWe conduct spill responses according to a plan that identifies appropriate resources (persons in charge and intervention materials) and expertise. This plan assists on-site personnel with dealing with spills by clearly setting out the responsibilities for the actions necessary to stop and contain the spill and to mitigate its effects. This includes techniques for preventing the spill from moving beyond the immediate site and collecting the spilled substance and contaminated material. Clear communication and coordination protocols are set out in the local plans, particularly where national or international response resources may be required. We carry out regular oil spill response drills and training.\n\n#### **Clean-up and Remediation**\n\nOil spills are assessed and cleaned up immediately after their occurrence in accordance with the Spill Preparedness and Response Planning Annex of our Environmental Standard. In particularly difficult cases, we rely on third-party support for capping and containment, surface clean-up, and emergency management. Leaks are repaired immediately or within defined time frames in accordance with the site's maintenance processes and based on the risk assessment outcome and other factors, such as feasibility of repair during operation. To strengthen our response to and reduce the environmental impact of oil spills, we continue to perform emergency drills, including pollution scenarios. We approach remediation measures in line with the relevant legal requirements, which include clean-up, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or replacement of damaged environmental receptors.\n\nWe ensure that the affected land is fit for the intended use by implementing remediation measures, including cleaning up spills (e.g., by excavation and clean earth filling) as well as relying on natural attenuation (recovery) based on the respective decision of the environmental authorities. Provisions are included in our accounts for the liabilities related to spills and cover cleaning and remediation costs.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n#### **Total volume of spills**\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/16 description: The image is a bar chart showing data from 2019 to 2023. The y axis is labeled 'In m3'. The value for 2019 is 56.6, for 2020 is 41.4, for 2021 is 81.0, for 2022 is 223.5, and for 2023 is 185.7.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nIn 2023, another significant spill occurred in the Exploration & Production division of OMV Petrom in Romania. Between June 4 and 5, 2023, an oil-water spill occurred downhill from a buried pumping pipeline connecting Park 11 to Tank Farm (TF) Independenta, Asset Moldova E&P. An agricultural area of 500 m<sup>2</sup> was affected. The Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) event lasted for around 20 hours, until Monday, June 5 (10 p.m.) when the pumping was stopped. Production measurement at the Tank Farm and calculations indicated an estimated loss of 200 m<sup>3</sup> gross oil-water volume (85 t oil and 100 m<sup>3</sup> produced water). Lessons learned from 2022 could not prevent this spill because of the specific design and age of the pipeline. The incident was thoroughly investigated in accordance with internal regulations and the root causes were identified. All recommendations raised address the technical upgrade of pipelines with an old design as well as updating the work instructions to prevent major consequences. All measures are in the implementation phase and lessons learned are being shared and discussed within the organization.\n\nThe majority of our spills occur at OMV Petrom. In 2023, the Pipeline Integrity Management Program in the Exploration & Production division continued, and the resulting actions were embedded in the Integrated Risk Register. A total of 31 pipeline projects were executed to show our commitment to this program. The Pipeline Inspection Program also witnessed the completion of a number of successful New Technology projects, resulting in the capacity to perform inspections that were not possible in the past. These new technologies are now part of our regular inspection options and will serve to enhance pipeline integrity in the future. In addition, OMV Petrom continues to reduce the number of kilometers of pipelines through several field optimization projects, which will reduce the risk of exposure by removing numerous aging pipelines while maintaining optimal production.\n\nThe Corrosion Management Plans developed over the past few years are now fully implemented and the remaining locations are being finalized. This has helped improve the integrity and longevity of our pipelines through cleaning, inspection, and introduction of inhibition chemicals, along with new corrosion monitoring techniques. In our offshore asset, a large maintenance optimization project was kicked off in 2023 that will ensure all the right maintenance is being performed at the optimal intervals. This review will conclude in 2024.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nEvery year, we assess any occurrences of spills and use any \"lessons learned\" as a basis for improving our process safety in the coming years. For the significant spill in Romania in 2023, lessons learned included reviewing the risk ranking of pipelines crossing environmentally sensitive areas, reviewing pipeline testing procedures, and reassessing the methodology for inspecting aging pipelines. In 2024, the OMV Group aims to prevent process safety events at all our sites across the globe, ultimately resulting in the reduction of spills.

Examples of non-hazardous waste include excavated soil, as well as mixed municipal waste, paper, and metal.\n\nIn addition, as a producer of plastics, we are deeply aware of the issue of plastic waste. Too often, unmanaged plastic waste is dumped in unsanitary landfills or burned, therefore increasing the risk of leakage into waterways, lakes, or oceans and thus causing negative impacts on the environment, marine life, and, potentially, human health. This section of the Sustainability Report focuses on waste management in our operations. For more on end-of-life waste, please see the focus area Circular Economy.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nAccording to OMV's Environmental Management Standard, all OMV Group businesses and activities are required to identify and use the least hazardous material option and to minimize both the use of raw materials and the subsequent generation of waste. The following hierarchy is applied to controlling waste: prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, other recovery (e.g., energy recovery), and, lastly, disposal in a controlled manner. The disposal of liquids in landfills and the burning of solid and liquid materials in open burning pits or any other location are not permitted.\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard further requires that environmental and social components be identified for the entire life cycle of facilities, including decommissioning and abandonment, so that any future adaptation measures can be identified and planned for. The needs of local communities, including indigenous peoples, are incorporated and addressed throughout all phases of the project life cycle, including during decommissioning or abandonment.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Application of Best Practices**\n\nInternational industry best practice is applied for the management and treatment of waste, including drilling waste. Where existing local, regional, or national waste management facilities are inadequate, OMV supports third parties in developing their capability.\n\n#### **Recycling**\n\nWaste is recovered and recycled where possible, including during site closure and decommissioning. If recycling is\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nnot possible, all waste is processed and/or disposed of only in licensed facilities or via reputable licensed contractors. Waste contractors are regularly audited.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Waste Recovery or Recycling Rate**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/7 description: The image is a line graph showing data from 2020 to 2023. The y-axis is labeled 'In %' and ranges from 30 to 80. The data points are as follows: In 2020, the value is 68. In 2021, the value is 68. In 2022, the value is 63. In 2023, the value is 74.\n\n- 81% of OMV's total waste comes from OMV Petrom. OMV Petrom continued to work on site restoration at the remaining five depots in Constanța, Zalău ANRS, Iaṣi, Oradea, and Găeṣti. At the Zalău ANRS, Oradea, and Găeṣti depots, the restoration works were finalized in 2023. Over the past few years, 42 former fuel terminals have already been restored, with sites having been remediated to initial preoperational state. In addition to the 249,575 m<sup>3</sup> of soil/subsoil contaminated with petroleum products generated and treated over previous years, around 53,372 m<sup>3</sup> of additional contaminated soil was treated in 2023. The treatment is performed using site-specific methods in line with best practice (e.g., bioremediation technologies off site and on site with injection). We achieved a recovery rate of 99% for the contaminated soil treated, which we then used for on-site backfills or directed to other authorized locations. We performed periodic monitoring during and after site rehabilitation, as requested for each site by environmental authorities. The site status (e.g., land covered by grass, soil compaction) is monitored quarterly for one year after our works are finalized. The decontamination work on the former petroleum products terminal in Constanța was carried out in close collaboration and alongside the archaeological research conducted by the Museum of National History and Archaeology Constanța (MINAC). This was done according to national legislation, and due to the site's high archaeological potential. During the archaeological survey, many artefacts of historical significance were also discovered.\n- To celebrate World Environment Day (WED), which takes place annually on June 5, OMV Tunisia launched the #BeatPlasticPollution campaign in Gabès and the south of Tunisia where it operates. Some 25 people from corporate volunteering, including members of the OMV Tunisia leadership team, were present at the beach in Gabès to participate in the \"Run and Plog\" activities jointly organized by OMV and other public sector institutions and local non-government organizations. Participants engaged in a plastic waste collection rally. The Gabès coastline is home to a vulnerable ecosystem in the Mediterranean with increased interest in preserving marine biodiversity (e.g., endangered turtle species). From Gabès, we moved to our sites in the desert of Tataouine. Another cleaning campaign was held in the heart of the desert, where Waha CPF, Nawara CPF field teams, and contractors gathered to pick up littered plastic. Two permanent containers were also placed on the road to allow travelers to dispose of plastic bottles in an adequate way.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nAs part of our Sustainability Strategy 2025, we plan to increase the reuse and recycling of waste from operations. Over the coming year, we plan to review the Waste Management Plans across the OMV Group.\n\n#### Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity supports human and societal needs, including food and nutrition security, energy, development of medicines and pharmaceuticals, freshwater, and clean air, which together underpin good health. It also supports economic opportunities and leisure activities that contribute to our overall well-being. Biodiversity conservation provides substantial benefits, such as clean, consistent water flows, protection from floods and storms, and a stable climate. The loss of biodiversity is perilous, and its consequences are immediate.\n\nIn December 2022, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted with the objective of taking urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, thereby putting nature on a path to recovery by 2030. Accordingly, the EU's biodiversity strategy for 2030, which is a comprehensive, ambitious, and long-term plan to protect nature and reverse the degradation of ecosystems, aims to put Europe's biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030 and contains specific actions and commitments.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group is committed to preserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems in alignment with the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the EU's biodiversity strategy. The OMV Group's Environ-\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/76/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nmental Management Standard and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure state that all OMV activities must be conducted in such a way as to cause minimal disturbance to protected areas and to local flora and fauna.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nObserved or predicted direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) are described and analyzed in environmental impact assessments. Through these impact assessments, the presence of nationally or globally endangered species and nationally or internationally recognized protected areas are identified.\n\n#### **Biodiversity Management Plans**\n\nOMV is in contact with Ipieca's Biodiversity Task Force, which issued a guide on how to develop biodiversity action plans in 2022. OMV aims to develop Biodiversity Management Plans based on this guide for all operations and projects where significant risks are identified.\n\n#### **Mitigation and Rehabilitation**\n\nIn the event of significant observed or predicted impacts, we apply the mitigation hierarchy, and action planning gives priority to avoidance and minimization over the restoration and offsetting of the impact. Mitigation measures include, for example, the rerouting of pipelines or scheduling projects during seasons when the impact on breeding populations can be avoided.\n\nAn example of good practice in biodiversity management can be taken from the Berling development project (formerly Iris Hades) in offshore Norway. The aim was to avoid any damage to sensitive cold-water coral. Building on available know-how and technology, biodiversity screening and baseline studies were executed as part of the environmental impact assessment. The mitigation hierarchy was applied by selecting the well location, template location, and pipeline routing as far away as possible from any coral colonies. The best available technologies were utilized to minimize any impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, OMV Petrom continued the cleaning, remediation, and ecological reconstruction works for five former fuel terminals (for more information, see [Waste\\)](https://reports.omv.com/en/sustainability-report/2022/focus-areas/natural-resources-management/environment/waste.html). During this project, we performed periodic monitoring during and after site rehabilitation, as requested for each site by the environmental authorities. Examples of this monitoring include taking samples of soil/subsoil and checking the groundwater in each phase of the project (e.g., excavation, bioremediation). This is carried out on a quarterly basis for one year after our work is finalized.\n\n#### **Working with Third Parties**\n\nOMV works locally with third parties on restoration and rehabilitation projects. For example, in 2023, we supported the following biodiversity-related projects in New Zealand as part of our wider Stakeholder Engagement and Corporate Social Responsibility portfolio. New Zealand has the highest number of threatened indigenous species in the world.<sup>19</sup>\n\n- Partnership with Ngāti Koata and the Department of Conservation for the Moawhitu lake and wetland regeneration project\n- Partnership with the Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust, creating a predator-free reserve in South Taranaki, thereby protecting the endemic hihi bird (stitchbird) in this reserve located just outside of New Plymouth\n- Partnership with the local hapū at Pohokura to restore and protect the wetlands on site\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n- We initiated a Group-wide project to establish a nature and biodiversity framework for the OMV Group, as part of which we are applying the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD) Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare (LEAP) approach to identify priority sites, evaluate impacts and dependencies, assess risks and opportunities, and prepare to respond to nature-related risks and opportunities and to report on material nature-related issues.\n- We again took steps to prevent impacts on sensitive species and ecosystems. For instance, during our exploration activities at the Wittau site in Austria, a range of technologies were used to mitigate impacts on insects and birds as much as possible. As the target location was positioned below a sensitive area, we moved the drill site to a less sensitive place and applied directional drilling technology. Insect-friendly lighting was used during the whole drilling operation. For well testing, enclosed incinerators were used instead of open flares to minimize disturbance to the local ecosystem.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, we plan to apply the TNFD LEAP approach to all our operated sites (excluding filling stations) and develop the processes for consistent biodiversity management in our operated sites. Subsequently, we plan to extend the scope to value chain impacts. In 2024, OMV will also continue supporting local biodiversity initiatives such as the Ngāti Koata and the Department of Conservation for the Moawhitu lake and wetland regeneration project, and the partnership with the Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust in New Zealand.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n## Non-GHG Air Emissions\n\nExposure to air pollution can affect everyone's health. It is the greatest environmental threat to public health globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued stricter recommendations on safe air pollution levels in a bid to curb the millions of premature deaths and loss of millions more healthy years of life caused by air pollution.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group's Environmental Management Standard stipulates that all OMV Group businesses and activities must understand the impacts of their air emissions on local and regional ambient air quality. Air emissions are required to be monitored, controlled, and minimized in order to mitigate the potential effects on human health and harm to the environment. There are strong legal requirements surrounding air emissions in the EU, which is where all our refineries are located. For instance, the EU does not permit the use of fuels containing sulfur to prevent transport-related SOx emissions. Sulfur has a significant impact on health, for example sulfur dioxide affects the respiratory system, particularly lung function, and can irritate the eyes. It causes coughing and mucus secretion and aggravates conditions such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Monitoring**\n\nIn all our refineries, we monitor emissions of pollutants such as sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter/dust, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) as required by European and national legislation and the respective permits. If emissions are found to be in excess of nationally prescribed limits and/or limits defined in a permit, additional monitoring stations are installed, and measures are implemented. For example, in OMV Tunisia, pollutant emissions from combustion processes such as NOx or CO have caused great public concern due to their impact on health and the environment. The past decade has witnessed rapid changes both in the regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions and in the technologies used to meet these regulations. Monitoring of these emissions is typically performed with a Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), which is a packaged system of gas analyzers necessary for the determination of gases and particles to stay within Tunisian emissions regulations. Because of this, we installed a pollutant analyzer on the turbines at GTP.\n\n#### **Prevention and Treatment**\n\nOMV has long implemented technologies to reduce emissions, such as installing end-of-pipes, abatement technologies, and floating roofs to reduce emissions of VOCs. Over the past years, we have focused on upgrading such technologies to ensure that they are still effective and reducing emissions. For instance, a SNOx flue gas cleaning plant at the Schwechat refinery was commissioned. With the SNOx Refurbishment of Wet Sulfuric Acid (WSA) program, in which a solution patented by OMV (two-layer PFA film structure with monitoring system) was implemented, both the reliability and the availability of the flue gas cleaning system could be increased. The flue gas cleaning plant at the Schwechat refinery is used for the removal of dust, and for denitrification and desulfurization of flue gases from the two power plants before they are emitted via the stack. As a first process step, dust is separated via electrostatic precipitators. During selective catalytic reduction, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are converted into free nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) by injecting ammonia (NH3). In the third step, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is oxidized with the aid of a catalyst and reacts with residual moisture to form gaseous sulfuric acid. Finally, the sulfuric acid is condensed in the WSA by means of air cooling and heat recovery. The sulfuric acid obtained in this way is then either sold or used for pH adjustment within the refinery. By applying these process steps, 98% of dust can be separated, more than 96% of sulfur can be recovered, and around 95% of NOx emissions can be prevented. With the catalyst update, a NOx reduction rate of around 95% is now achievable again. At other emissions sources at the Schwechat refinery, we continued our work on reducing emissions to air. The installation of a fourth electrical field at the existing electrostatic precipitator of the FCC plant aided the significant reduction of dust emissions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n- In Norway, we included the reduction of emissions to air in our drilling operations by incentivizing emissions reduction measures in our drilling contracts. As a result, in the Velocette drilling campaign, selective catalytic reduction was installed at the engine exhausts to reduce NOx emissions by approximately 74%.\n- In 2023, Borealis put a wastewater treatment plant in Stenungsund into operation. The new wastewater treatment unit will reduce the emission of contaminants to the sea and will also minimize VOC emissions to the air, since all treatment steps are covered and enclosed. The new unit includes buffering in two tanks and physical and chemical treatment of the water in Dissolved Nitrogen Flotation (DNF) units. The off-gas from the different steps will be treated by adsorption in carbon filters.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n- OMV Petrom continues to restore sites as it has done previously for former fuel terminals or abandoned facilities. The best practices applied include the use of a water spray curtain, dust protection nets, forced ventilation, off-site bioremediation of the most heavily contaminated soil, and periodic communication with the community and the authorities. In periods of strong wind, OMV Petrom always minimizes dust-producing activities, wets surfaces more thoroughly, and covers the surfaces of on-site biopiles. This subsequently reduces the impact on the air quality. Regarding odor and dust control during soil excavation and transport, OMV Petrom has optimized transportation routes to minimize disturbance to the community, and always secures loads and cleans the wheels at the site exit to avoid the contamination of public roads, and sprinkles the access roads on site.\n- In OMV Petrom R&M, the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program in accordance with BAT Reference Documents (BREF) continued to be carried out at the Petrobrazi refinery. The objective of this program is to reduce fugitive emissions from the plant's technical equipment (e.g., vents, flanges). We continued the program, targeting accessible fugitive emissions sources from coking, the catalytic reforming complex, catalytic cracking and GASCON units, as well as the tank park including the screening of inaccessible sources. 48% of the leakages identified could be fixed. The program will run periodically, according to a schedule, in all Petrobrazi installations.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2021, we launched a pilot project to develop an Odor Management Plan for one representative facility at an E&P asset of OMV Petrom. Due to legal uncertainties, the pilot project could not be finalized in 2023. As soon as requirements are clear, we will finalize the development and implementation of the Odor Management Plan.\n\n## Circular Economy\n\n#### **Material Topic: Circular Economy**\n\nDecoupling economic growth from resource depletion by recovering and reusing products or waste to make new materials and products, such as recycled or biobased polyolefins\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\n- GRI 306: Waste 2020\n\nGRI 306: Waste 2020 Environmental concerns\n\n### **Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/14 description: The image shows four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, they are: SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).\n\nThe OMV Group believes that transitioning to a circular economy will significantly reduce its impact on the environment and its GHG emissions. A circular economy decouples economic growth from resource depletion by keeping materials, resources, and products in circulation and by preventing the leakage of these resources into the environment as much as possible, particularly into the oceans and landfill sites. Transitioning from a linear \"takemake-waste\" economy to a circular \"reduce-reuse-recycle\" economy will also help curb global warming. Through the efficient use of precious resources, it is possible to recover and reuse by-products or waste by transforming them into new materials and products. This approach has the potential to greatly decrease associated emissions along product value chains.\n\nIn addition to recycling plastic waste and reusing it to make new materials and products, the OMV Group also sees plastics based on renewable feedstock as playing a key role in the circular economy. The use of renewable feedstock lowers the demand for fossil feedstock and considerably decreases carbon footprints. The OMV Group focuses on utilizing waste biomass, such as residual forestry matter that is not in competition with the food and feed chain, and thus does not require the use of additional natural resources such as land or water. If then recycled,\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house has a simple, triangular roof and a rectangular body with a vertical line representing a door. The circle is also blue and has a thin outline.\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer, the second is a left arrow, and the third is a right arrow.\n\nsuch second-generation bioplastics can play a vital role in a sustainable, circular economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on two fronts, cutting emissions in the input and in the end-of-life phase.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/4 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Sustainable polyolefins production capacity In kt\". The x-axis shows the years 2022, 2023, 2025, and 2030. The y-axis shows the production capacity. In 2022, the production capacity is 148.5. In 2023, the production capacity is 195.9. In 2025, the production capacity is 614.0. In 2030, the production capacity is ~2,000. The graph also includes a legend that shows the different types of recycling: Mechanical Recycling, Chemical Recycling, and Biobased.\n\nThe creation of a truly circular economy also has wider societal implications. It will provide economic benefits to society by reducing the major financial burden of ineffective waste management systems and pollution management, and will create new business opportunities and employment at various stages along the value chain. A circular economy will also result in better living and working conditions, and an overall cleaner environment.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of a majority share in the polyolefins producer Borealis in 2020 and the consolidation of Borealis into the C&M segment within OMV, circular economy is now a cornerstone of the OMV Group's Strategy 2030. By 2030, the aim is to establish a production capacity of 2 mn t of sustainable polymers and chemicals per year, i.e., polyolefin products or other chemicals derived from plastic waste (either through a mechanical or chemical recycling process) or from biobased feedstock. In parallel, the use of fossil fuels will decrease, as the aim is to reduce oil and gas production levels to around 350 kboe/d and reduce crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t by 2030. These fossil fuels would ordinarily also be used to make polymers; instead, more polymers will be based on recycled waste or renewable resources such as biobased feedstock. In 2023, the OMV Group established a production capacity of 195.9 kt of sustainable (including recycled and biobased) polyolefins and other chemicals.\n\n| Target 2025        | Establish production capacity of 600 kta sustainable<br>(including recycled and biobased) polyolefins and other<br>chemicals                 |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target 2030        | Establish production capacity of approximately 2,000 kta<br>sustainable (including recycled and biobased) polyolefins<br>and other chemicals |\n| Status 2023        | Production capacity of 195.9 kta established                                                                                                 |\n| Most relevant SDGs |                                                                                                                                              |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**8.4** Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavor to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programs on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead\n\n**9.4** By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities\n\n**12.5** By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\n\n**14.1** By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThrough its subsidiary Borealis, the OMV Group is promoting the circular economy across the industry by launching initiatives and participating in activities and platforms that drive recycling options and solutions. Borealis is a core partner in the New Plastics Economy (NPEC), a member of the EU's Circular Plastics Alliance, and, as a member of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, supports the development of the UN treaty to end plastic pollution.\n\nThe OMV Group's goal is to take on a leading position in the circularity of plastics and to offer its customers innovative solutions that advance the circular economy. In order to transition to a truly circular and carbon-neutral economy, a variety of solutions will be required to keep products circulating at their highest value, quality, and utility over many lifetimes. This can only be achieved by using a full suite of different, complementary technologies that come into play in a cascading way. This integrated approach is embodied in the Circular Cascade Model.\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/5 description: The image shows a circular diagram of a polyolefin production and recycling process. The diagram starts with three inputs: \"Base chemicals from direct carbon capture\", \"Renewable feedstock\", and \"Fossil feedstock\", all of which lead to a \"Base chemical producer\". The output of this producer goes to a \"Polyolefin producer\". From there, the process moves to \"Use Reuse\", which is represented by a landscape with trees and water. The next step is \"Use Reuse\", followed by \"End product\", and then \"Waste collecting and sorting\". The diagram then splits into two recycling paths: \"Mechanical Recycling\" and \"Chemical Recycling\", both of which lead back to the \"Polyolefin producer\". The diagram also includes \"Design for Eco-Efficiency\" and \"Design for Recycling\" as key considerations in the process.\n\n#### **Design for Eco-Efficiency**\n\nThis means adopting a fundamental design mindset that starts with minimizing the use of resources during production and maximizing the product's lifetime value. Borealis' foam business is a prime example of eco-efficient polyolefin solutions. This business line is used in industries such as packaging, sports, transportation, and construction, and helps facilitate the transition to a circular economy as it is especially suited to ultra-lightweight foam applications while being fully recyclable.\n\nIn 2023, Borealis increased its participation in Bockatech EcoCore®, a patented manufacturing technology for foamed articles that uses Borealis' HMS (high melt strength) polypropylene. The aim is to enable a greater number of global customers, value chain partners, and supply chain players to benefit from a broader range of lighter foam-based applications, primarily in the packaging sector.\n\n#### **Reuse**\n\nReuse is a core element of circularity, as circular change starts first with reduction and reuse, before recovery and recycling close the loop. This step aims to maximize and extend the lifetime of products that are already in circulation. This will be fostered by leveraging knowledge of plastic use and processing, and by establishing systems and business models designed to encourage reuse.\n\nPartnerships are vital for broadening knowledge about reuse activities and ensuring sustainable growth. In 2023, Borealis further strengthened its commitment to the reuse principle by engaging in several collaborative projects with value chain partners. For example, Borealis joined the 4everPack consortium, a two-year research program run by the Finnish institute VTT and funded by Business Finland. The project aims to replace the linear economy with a fully circular model, focusing on the reusable packaging value chain. Borealis will provide its know-how and expertise in\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ninnovative material and packaging design for the selected reuse systems.\n\n#### **Design for Recycling**\n\nA key challenge in increasing the recycling of plastics is that many products are not intentionally designed for recycling in the first place. For example, flexible packaging often uses layers of different materials, which makes separating and recycling the plastic content extremely difficult. The challenge is to create packaging that uses only a single material, while maintaining or even improving performance. Thus, Design for Recyclability (DfR) emphasizes that a product must be designed with the intention that it can be easily collected, sorted, and recycled. DfR is an important aspect of eco-efficient design and takes a life cycle approach by carefully and intelligently balancing the production, use, and after-use phases of a product.\n\nInspired by the EU Commission's vision for increased levels of recycling, brand owners worldwide are committing to developing 100% recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging solutions by 2025. To further DfR, Borealis developed and actively promotes its 10 Codes of Conduct for polyolefin packaging designers. These help designers develop packaging materials that can be successfully recycled and used again, either for the same application or in other products. The Codes are being incorporated into assessment methodologies for recyclability, for example in future modulated Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines for packaging.\n\nBorealis also applies its innovation activities to offer alternatives to materials and material combinations that are not recyclable today and collaborates with value chain partners to expand its range of fully recyclable, mono-material solutions. At the Plastics Recycling Show Europe 2023, Borealis launched a new mono-material pouch containing over 95% polypropylene (PP), which is fully designed for mechanical recycling. This could help meet the ambitious recycling and waste reduction targets set out in the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, as well as ecomodulation criteria for EPR programs.\n\nBorealis is an active member of the HolyGrail 2.0 (HG 2.0) digital wan already to more than 170 members, including over 40 brand owners and retailers. This initiative, which is driven by the AIM (European Brands Association) and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, is a pilot project working to prove the technical viability of digital watermarks (i.e., almost imperceptible postage stampsized codes on the packaging) for the accurate sorting of packaging waste as well as to prove the economic viability of the business case on a large scale. In 2023, digital watermarking initiative Holy Grail 2.0 entered the final phase of research and development trials to validate the technology\n\nat the highest technical level and prepare it for market entry. Borealis will perform recycling tests on the PP film and polyethylene flexibles generated by the sorting trials conducted by Hündgen Entsorgung, who is using the packaging volumes put on the market by Holy Grail 2.0 brand company members in Germany and Denmark.\n\n#### **Closing the Loop**\n\nThe potential for product reuse also has its limits. This is when the steps of recovery and recycling come into play in the circular cascade model in order to close the loop on plastic waste. The OMV Group is fully committed to broadening the range of circular products. It therefore ranks the development of mechanical and chemical recycling equally, as they are seen as complementary to each other. The Group's ambitions in the area of mechanical recycling lie with its subsidiary Borealis, which continues to work with partners to develop new technologies for mechanical recycling, with the objective of delivering products with near-virgin quality where possible, and with the lowest carbon footprint (read more in Mechanical Recycling).\n\nChemical recycling can extract value from residual waste streams from mechanical recycling and mixed plastic waste streams, which would otherwise be sent to landfill or be incinerated. This process involves changing the chemical composition of the plastic. The resulting synthetic pyrolysis oil can then be used again to make any type of plastic or product. Since it is practically comparable to virgin plastics, it can also serve a more diverse field of applications (read more in Chemical Recycling).\n\nThere is rising demand for both high-quality recyclates and product-based solutions for renewable feedstocks. The OMV Group is committed to supporting producers and brand owners in meeting environmental and regulatory challenges and is therefore continuously developing its circular and renewable product offering. The wide range of mechanically recycled products falls under the Borcycle™ M umbrella, and chemically recycled product solutions are in the Borcycle™ C portfolio. Borealis also offers and markets circular polyolefin products based on renewable feedstock: Bornewables™(read more in Renewable Feedstock).\n\nBorvida™ represents the portfolio of circular base chemicals. Borvida B, from non-food waste biomass, and Borvida C, from chemically recycled plastic waste, are the first products in the portfolio. In the future, it will be expanded to include Borvida A, from atmospheric carbon capture.\n\nThe OMV Group is also committed to reducing plastic leakage. In 2017, Borealis initiated Project STOP (Stop Ocean Plastics) in Indonesia. Co-founded with SYSTEMIQ, this program aims to achieve zero leakage of waste into\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house.\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/2 description: The image contains three circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nthe environment and increase plastics recycling. Project STOP focuses on the regions with the highest leakage rates and, with the support of industry and government partners, works hand in hand with cities to create leak-free, low-cost, and more circular waste management systems (read more in Community Investments and on the [Project](https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/en_gb/) [STOP website](https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/en_gb/)).\n\n## Governance\n\nThe circular economy has been on the OMV Group's agenda since 2015, and has become even more important since the acquisition of a majority share in Borealis in 2020. Several aspects of the circular economy, in particular mechanical and chemical recycling, are now jointly being developed further.\n\nWith the new Strategy 2030, which was introduced in March 2022, OMV emphasized once again the importance of a circular economy for a sustainable chemicals business going forward. This is the reason why the OMV Group plans to implement a fundamental strategic shift from a linear toward a circular business approach. The C&M business segment will act as the growth engine of the Company. It is to be substantially strengthened, expanded, and diversified, with the aim of developing into a leader in high-quality polyolefin solutions, as well as renewable and circular chemicals and materials. In order to implement this strategy, a new target operating model was defined. This new organization came into effect in 2023 and forms the backbone of the strategy execution.\n\nThe C&M segment continues to cover the entire chemicals value chain, including responsibility for capturing value from the circular economy. As one of the focus areas in the C&M segment, Circular Economy forms a separate business unit. This unit covers business development activities, as well as activities related to circular feedstock.\n\nThe department covering the further development of OMV's ReOil® technology is now allocated to the new corporate unit Innovation & Technology, and with that has moved into the direct responsibility of OMV's CEO. Among other things, the new licensing business will also be managed by a separate department within this unit in order to license sustainable technologies developed by OMV to the wider industry. The establishment of a dedicated corporate function focusing on innovation and technology under the leadership of the CEO is based on the idea that the transformation will be fueled by a high degree of innovation and new technologies, while maximizing the value of the life cycle management of current technologies and the new organization will strengthen these capabilities across the Group.\n\nMost of the OMV Group's circular economy initiatives, especially those regarding mechanical recycling and circular products, are run by Borealis. To accelerate its transition to a circular model, Borealis has a dedicated department called Circular Economy Solutions and New Business Development. This department leads the execution of Borealis' circular economy strategy based on several thematic project focus areas, such as recycling or design for recyclability, in addition to assisting all other Borealis business areas in their industry-specific transitions. A dedicated business team is fully focused on short- to mid-term business growth opportunities in mechanical recycling, including Borealis' mtm plastics and Ecoplast businesses. The Circular Economy Innovation Studio at Borealis' Innovation Headquarters in Linz, Austria, remains Borealis' spearhead for technology and innovation, while the Digital Studio in Brussels, Belgium, is creating digital solutions for circularity. This setup enables Borealis to constantly learn and push innovation boundaries, while the business grows by offering customer-centric circular solutions that satisfy today's needs.\n\nIn 2018, Borealis launched a dedicated communication platform, EverMinds™. This platform serves to streamline all of Borealis' circular economy-related activities in order to boost their impact and promote familiarity with the topic. The platform facilitates deeper collaboration between Borealis and its partners in the interest of developing innovative and sustainable polyolefin solutions based on the circular model of design for circularity, reuse, and recycling. Further details on Borealis' specific initiatives, management, governance, and development of circular products can be found in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/digital-annual-report-2022)\n\nThe OMV Group has a variety of initiatives in place to raise awareness about recycling among its employees, specifically with regard to recycling of plastics. For instance, informative internal blogs are regularly published, and expert talks are organized with the aim of better informing employees on how to identify plastic recycling codes and the etiquette on how to correctly separate different types of plastic waste so that they will eventually be recycled.\n\nFrom June to September 2023, the newly launched Sustainability Academy provided a series of online training courses on circular economy and sustainable products. The learning path was designed to offer interested colleagues from all divisions information on and insights into the circular economy and give a more detailed overview of ongoing projects related to this material topic within the OMV Group. The training package included online learning material as well as several internal and external instructorled sessions that focused not only on introducing the concept of the circular economy, but also on providing a deeper dive into topics such as mechanical and chemical recycling. In addition, external factors like sustainability\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ncertifications and EU policies and regulations were introduced and discussed. Around 630 participants from across the OMV Group registered for the instructor-led sessions, emphasizing employees' interest in this topic.\n\n## Mechanical Recycling\n\nThe diverse properties of plastic enable a plethora of products and applications that make daily life safer, more mobile, and more eco-efficient. These properties allow us to ensure more sustainable living, while the global population grows and demand for plastic increases. However, within the linear economic model, plastic products are made, used, and then discarded. Continuing with this model will lead to more plastic waste and environmental pollution, while putting pressure on the planet's limited resources.\n\nBorealis is one of the world's leading providers of advanced and sustainable polyolefin solutions and a European front-runner in polyolefins recycling. OMV and Borealis are actively developing enhanced technologies to efficiently recycle two key plastic types, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), thereby providing an alternative to the linear \"take-make-waste\" economy. Mechanical recycling is one such technology. With mechanical recycling, the plastic is cleaned, mechanically flaked, melted down, and processed into plastic granulate. In an ideal scenario, this material can be used to make the same products again, i.e., a detergent bottle becomes a new detergent bottle. No change is made to the chemical structure of the plastic, which is why the feedstock must be sorted properly and even split into different colors.\n\nBorcycle™ M is Borealis' transformational technology for mechanical recycling, which gives polyolefin-based postconsumer waste a new lease of life. Using advanced mechanically recycled products out of the Borcycle™ M portfolio ensures a lower carbon footprint compared to using fully fossil-fuel-based products. Through Borealis and its subsidiaries (mtm plastics, Ecoplast, and a demo plant operated by a joint enterprise in Lahnstein), OMV operates three mechanical recycling plants. The demo plant in Lahnstein is a joint undertaking by Borealis, TOMRA, and Zimmerman, and was commissioned at the beginning of 2021.\n\nBorealis currently runs four mechanical recycling plants in Austria and Germany with a total capacity of around 100 kt p.a.\n\nmtm plastics GmbH, a leading German recycler of post-consumer polyolefins, was acquired in 2016. The company runs two plants and produces up to 70 kt p.a. of regranulate.\n\n- Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH in Austria was acquired in 2018. The company processes post-consumer plastic waste from households and industrial consumers into highquality recyclate destined primarily for the plastic film market. The plant has a capacity of 30 kt p.a.\n- A demo plant for advanced recycling was established in Germany in 2021 as part of a partnership with TOMRA, a Norwegian collection and sorting machine manufacturer, and Zimmermann, a German waste management company. It is one of the world's most advanced mechanical recycling plants and implements the Borcycle™ M technology.\n\nIn 2022, Borealis started looking into the development of a commercial-scale advanced mechanical recycling plant in Austria, based on the Borcycle™ M technology. The decision was supported with positive feedback from the market on the recycled polyolefins delivered by the demo plant in Lahnstein, Germany, using the same technology.\n\nThe acquisition of Rialti S.p.A. in November 2023 increases the current sustainable polyolefins production capacity by a further 50 kt. As soon as the acquisition of Integra Plastics AD, which was announced in November 2023, is completed, another 20 kt of recycling capacity will be added to Borealis' advanced mechanical recycling portfolio.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nThe Borealis recycling businesses mtm plastics and Ecoplast are certified according to the Europe-wide EuCert-Plast certification program for companies that recycle postconsumer plastic waste.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn January 2023, Borealis announced that its subsidiary Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling GmbH, a mechanical polyolefin recycler based in Wildon, Austria, had received the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS). ISCC PLUS is a global certification that covers the entire supply chain, from raw material to final product, guaranteeing compliance with the highest standards for ecological and social sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions savings, and traceability. Ecoplast is the first mechanical polyolefin recycler in Austria to achieve the certification.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- In 2023, Borealis presented a new mono-material pouch containing over 95% PP and designed for recycling, developed in collaboration with value chain partners. When processed within dedicated mechanical recycling streams for PP, this mono-material pouch yields greater volumes of high-quality recyclate fit for use in non-food, flexible PP packaging applications. It is thus the ideal format with which to fulfil the principal aims of the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR): improve recyclability, grow the market for recycled content, and reduce packaging waste. As a mono-material PP packaging format, it can help meet ambitious recycling and waste reduction targets set forth in the PPWR, as well as eco-modulation criteria for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs.\n- In June 2023, Borealis acquired Rialti S.p.A., a leading European producer of recycled polypropylene compounds. The transaction was successfully completed in November 2023. Based in Italy, Rialti is one of the European market leaders specialized in the production of sustainable polypropylene (PP) compounds with a focus on mechanically recycled PP feedstock from post-industrial and post-consumer waste. The investment will strengthen Borealis' circular portfolio, adding 50 kt of recycled compounding capacity and meeting growing customer demand for sustainable solutions.\n- In November 2023, Borealis announced the signing of an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in Integra Plastics AD, an advanced mechanical recycling player based in Bulgaria. Integra Plastics AD operates a modern advanced mechanical recycling plant built in 2019 with state-of-the-art equipment. Integra Plastics has the ability to transform post-consumer waste into high-quality polyolefin recyclates suitable for demanding applications. This investment will add more than 20 kt of recycling capacity to Borealis' advanced mechanical recycling portfolio.\n- In July 2023, Borealis' PO compounding site in Monza, Italy, received ISCC PLUS certification, as did its mechanical recycling plant mtm plastics in November. Earlier Borealis had achieved the milestone of having all of its European PO operations and PO compounding sites (with the exception of the newly acquired Rialti in Italy) certified, in addition to the Renasci recycling sites in Ostend, Belgium, and Ecoplast in Austria.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024 and over the coming years, OMV will focus on making further investments in Borealis' mechanical recycling production capacities to enable the commercial ramp-up of its circular portfolio to continuously progress toward its targets.\n\n## Chemical Recycling\n\nChemical recycling comes into play when mechanical recycling reaches its limits, for example in products where multiple types of plastics are used together. While most rigid plastic waste can be processed quite effectively through mechanical recycling, flexible materials (e.g., plastic film) are still predominantly incinerated or sent to landfill. Chemical recycling is the only way of overcoming this challenge. It involves altering the chemical composition of the plastic to produce pyrolysis oil from plastic waste. This synthetic oil can then be used to make any type of plastic or product. Because the quality of these products is effectively comparable to virgin plastics, they can also be used in tightly regulated areas such as the food and medical industries. Plastic waste thereby becomes a valuable raw material.\n\nOMV has been exploring the potential for utilizing post-consumer plastics, i.e., polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, through chemical recycling since 2011. The Austrian Research Promotion Agency has also contributed to this effort with subsidies covering part of the project investment. The first test facility was launched in 2013. In 2018, the nextlevel test facility – the ReOil® 100 pilot plant – began fully refinery-integrated operation with a processing capacity of up to 100 kg/h and a production capacity of up to 100 l/h of pyrolysis oil.\n\nIn 2021, the final investment decision (FID) was made to build a prototype of a ReOil® demonstration plant at an intermediary refinery scale with a design capacity of 16 kta. This plant, called ReOil® 2000, will be fully operational in 2024. To finance this project, OMV entered its first-ever green loan agreement. This is aligned with the green loan principles and is based on a green and project-specific external due diligence appraisal, called a second party opinion, and a projectspecific green financing framework. The plant will be fully integrated within the petrochemical production units at the Schwechat refinery in Austria, enabling OMV to guarantee the best use of resources, maximum efficiency, and the highest industrial safety standards, while creating around 50 new jobs. It represents a crucial step in developing ReOil® into an industrial-scale chemical recycling technology with a processing capacity of up to 200 kta.\n\nThe pyrolysis oil produced in the ReOil® plant is further processed into monomers in the refinery's steam cracker to produce high-quality base chemicals for the plastics industry. At Borealis, these monomers are then converted into high-grade polymers. Borcycle™ C represents the portfolio of chemically recycled polyolefins that Borealis is offering to the market. These products are suitable for very demanding applications such as food contact materials. Borcycle™ C is not only the label for the portfolio of chemically recycled products offered to its customers, but also the designated name for Borealis' own technology solutions for chemical recycling. Along with\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body. The circle is also a simple line drawing and surrounds the house.\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nBorcycle™ M, in which \"M\" stands for mechanical recycling, it forms the Borcycle™ portfolio of all-round polyolefin solutions for plastics circularity based on the Borcycle™ technology suite launched in 2019.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Selection of Feedstock**\n\nThe ReOil® facility can process different forms of plastic waste, ranging from household waste to waste from commercial and industrial sources. The main feedstocks are polyethylene (e.g., films), polypropylene (e.g., food packaging and car parts), and polystyrene (e.g., packaging and insulation materials). Currently, the recycled feedstock is sourced almost exclusively from Austrian waste sorting facilities. With regard to the ambition of developing an industrial-scale ReOil® plant and the resulting need for more feedstock, the geographical scope for feedstock sourcing will be expanded and countries neighboring Austria will be explored.\n\n#### **Technology**\n\nPlastic is an excellent heat isolator with poor heat transfer properties, compared with glass or metal. These properties, which make plastic desirable in everyday life, also make it difficult to break down. OMV's proprietary ReOil® technology is based on pyrolysis, a well-known refinery process during which thermoplastics are first melted and then cracked at a temperature of about 400–450°C. This means that long-chain hydrocarbons are cracked into shorter-chain light hydrocarbons. One of the inherent challenges in pyrolysis stems from the fact that, compared with glass or metal, plastics are notoriously difficult to melt, and once melted, are highly viscous, which impairs the heat transfer necessary for pyrolysis. The ReOil® technology is unique compared to that of competitors because of the use of an innovative heat transfer technology, which allows the viscosity of the molten plastic to be reduced and thus heat transfer to be improved. As a result, the ReOil® process is scalable to industrial scale (up to 200 kta). Thanks to the integration into OMV's refinery in Schwechat, Austria, ReOil® also achieves higher yields than other non-integrated chemical recycling technologies.\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nThe ReOil® pilot plant and the ReOil® 2000 demo plant are both certified according to the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). ISCC PLUS is a sustainability certification that is well-recognized by all stakeholders in recycled and biobased materials, providing traceability along the supply chain and verifying that companies meet environmental and social standards. Compliance with the certification means that for each ton of circular feedstock fed into the ReOil® plant and replacing fossil fuels, a certain proportion of the output can be classified as circular by using the mass balance approach.\n\n#### **Emissions Reduction**\n\nIn 2021, OMV commissioned a life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the CO2 reduction potential of its ReOil<sup>®</sup> chemical recycling technology versus incineration. The LCA was conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology (ICT) according to ISO standards 14040 and 14044, and independently peer-reviewed by three world-leading institutes. The LCA analyzes the different treatments of one ton of pre-sorted mixed plastic waste on waste-to-gate level, starting with the collection of waste and ending with the production of polymers and energy. The LCA compares two systems ensuring the same outputs: (i) a linear economy, where waste goes to incineration producing thermal energy and electricity, and where polymers are produced from fossil sources, vs. (ii) a circular economy, where these waste streams are chemically recycled, and the same amount of thermal energy and electricity is produced based on the expected future energy mix in Austria. The LCA shows significant benefits of the circular economy system: 34% of CO2e emissions could be saved by 2030 if waste streams that are currently going to incineration are chemically recycled using the ReOil® technology.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\nIn October 2023, OMV announced the final investment decision to build an innovative sorting plant developed by Interzero, Europe's leading provider of circular economy solutions, to produce feedstock for chemical recycling. For that purpose, OMV and Interzero established a joint venture, in which OMV holds 89.9% of the shares and 10.1% of the shares belong to Interzero. OMV will invest over EUR 170 mn in building this state-of-the-art facility in Walldürn, southern Germany, which will also lead to the creation of around 120 new jobs on site. With a processing capacity of up to 260,000 t of post-consumer mixed waste plastic per year, this fully automatic sorting facility will be the first of its kind to produce feedstock for OMV's chemical recycling on a large industrial scale. The innovative sorting process used in the new facility will make it possible to recover a polyolefin-rich fraction from a waste stream that currently ends up in thermal recycling due to its unsuitability for mechanical recycling. This process has already been tested on an industrial scale and the product has been successfully processed as feedstock in OMV's ReOil® pilot plant. Construction began in Q4 2023 and production is expected to start in 2026. The strategic partnership between OMV and Interzero combines the complementary strengths and capabilities of both parties, with the joint aim of taking another step toward a world without waste.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/1 description: The image contains three icons. The first icon is a print icon inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle. The icons are all blue.\n\n- In October 2023, OMV and Wood, a global leader in consulting and engineering solutions in energy and materials markets, signed a mutually exclusive collaboration agreement for the commercial licensing of OMV's proprietary ReOil® technology, following a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed between the two parties in November 2022. The companies will bring the ReOil® technology to the global market together utilizing Wood's proprietary heater technology and will establish a joint technology and engineering delivery team to support clients throughout the whole process of adopting and successfully implementing the technology at their sites. In addition, Wood will work with ReOil® licensees to provide full asset life cycle support globally.\n- In early 2023, Borealis announced the capability to use its proprietary Borcycle™ C chemical recycling process to recycle cross-linked polyethylene (PE) types such as XLPE and PE-X into recycled polyethylene. Thanks to its suitability for high-performance applications, the recycled PE obtained from the pyrolysis process can replace virgin PE in the manufacture of XLPE and PE-X for use in the wire and cable and infrastructure industries respectively. Using ISCC PLUS certified grades in the Borcycle™ C portfolio enables customers to capitalize on circular solutions while at the same time maintaining high application quality and meeting industry standards.\n- Borealis entered into a partnership with Renasci in 2021 to work on the innovative Smart Chain Processing concept, including a plastic to pyrolysis oils process. In 2022, Borealis acquired a minority share in Renasci, which it increased to a majority shareholding of 50.01% in early 2023. The participation in Renasci was further increased in Q4 2023 to approximately 98%. The investment gives Borealis greater access to chemically recycled feedstock, thereby strengthening the Borcycle™ C portfolio.\n- In February 2023, Neste, Borealis, Uponor, and Wastewise successfully produced pipes made of crosslinked polyethylene (PE-X), which was based on feedstock gained from chemically recycled post-industrial waste plastic from PE-X pipe production using the ISCC PLUS-certified mass balance approach. PE-X pipes are an important contributor to energy-efficient heating and safe plumbing due to their robustness, temperature resistance, and longevity, yet the interconnected polymer chains make them nearly impossible to recycle using conventional recycling technologies. The project shows that chemical recycling can close the circularity loop for hard-to-recycle waste plastic, turning it into high-quality polymer feedstock and enabling the consecutive manufacturing of products with quality and properties identical to those in their previous life.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nSince the first ReOil® trials in OMV's own laboratory, there has been a lot of ongoing development. The ReOil® 2000 plant will become operational in 2024 at OMV's refinery site in Schwechat, Austria, with a capacity of 16 kta. The next step is the development of an industrial-scale ReOil® plant with a planned capacity of 200 kta. Furthermore, the first ReOil® licenses are due to be launched to the market over the course of 2024, marking an important milestone in promoting circularity and chemical recycling in the industry.\n\n### Renewable Feedstock\n\nTogether with partners, OMV is actively pursuing the development of industry-scale projects to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and bioplastics from renewable feedstock, including waste streams. Waste biomass, such as residual agricultural, forestry, and wood processing matter, or mixed municipal waste are not in competition with the food and feed chain. While the conversion of such waste biomass into high-value products is often technically challenging, the resulting benefits are a significant reduction in CO2 compared with fossil fuels and local resource utilization that creates value. The biobased feedstock, which is used at OMV's subsidiary Borealis in order to produce sustainable polyolefins, is currently entirely derived from waste biomass such as residual agricultural processing matter or collected waste streams and is not in competition with the food and feed chain. These polyolefins are marketed to the end customer under the portfolio name Bornewables™. In this section, the focus is on plastics based on renewable feedstock. For more information on energy products based on renewable feedstock, please refer to Energy Transition.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nAs a global standard for recycled and biobased materials, ISCC PLUS enables traceability along the supply chain by verifying that companies comply with certain environmental and social standards and by establishing a chain of custody. Applying the mass balance approach enables OMV to provide a verifiable basis for tracking the amount of its renewable and chemically recycled raw materials in the value chain. Providing more products that are certified by ISCC PLUS is crucial for the transition to a more circular economy. OMV's cracker in Burghausen was one of the first 20 worldwide to be ISCC PLUS certified for the production of renewable benzene, butadiene, and isobutylene. Additionally, the production of ethylene and propylene at OMV's Burghausen and Schwechat refineries is also ISCC PLUS certified.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/1 description: The image shows three circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left arrow. The third icon contains a right arrow.\n\nThe Bornewables™ portfolio, Borcycle™ C, and Borvida™ are certified according to ISCC PLUS, by applying the mass balance approach. This means that the materials are not physically segregated in the production processes throughout the entire supply chain, but they are separated in bookkeeping to provide a verifiable basis for tracking the amount and sustainability characteristics of circular and/or biobased content in the value chain. This certification system ensures the traceability of the renewable, sustainably produced feedstock from its point of origin through the entire chain of custody. The Bornewables™ polypropylene, for example, is a second-generation renewable feedstock, derived entirely from waste and residue vegetable oil streams. The milestone of having all of Borealis' European polyolefin and polyolefin compounding sites, the Renasci recycling sites in Oostende, Belgium, and Ecoplast in Austria ISCC PLUS certified was reached in mid-2023, when the PO compounding site in Monza, Italy, received the respective certification.\n\n#### **Life Cycle Assessment**\n\nIn the life cycle assessment published in 2021, Borealis demonstrated that Bornewables™ is especially suited to reducing carbon emissions. The assessment showed that the greenhouse gas emissions of Bornewables™ polypropylene and polyethylene go beyond carbon neutrality and can be reduced by at least 120% from cradle to gate (meaning all the steps from the sourcing of raw materials to products leaving Borealis' production site) compared to fossil-fuel-based polypropylene and polyethylene. According to the LCA's findings, using Bornewables™ substantially reduces a product's carbon footprint by at least 1.9 kg CO2e for every kilogram of polymer. This is possible while offering the same high performance levels as virgin polyolefins and the ability to be recycled in the same way.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nOMV is currently working on comprehensive life cycle assessments (LCAs) for its fossil-based and renewable petrochemical products being produced at the refineries in Burghausen, Germany, and Schwechat, Austria. These LCAs are being conducted in accordance with the applicable ISO standards 14040 and 14044 and will undergo a critical peer review process. Once completed, the results are expected to be published in 2024.\n\nOver the course of 2023, OMV's subsidiary Borealis continued to commercialize the Bornewables™ portfolio. Some significant developments include:\n\n- In April 2023, it was announced that PFNonwovens Group (PFN) had teamed up with Borealis to enhance their production of nonwoven materials for the personal hygiene market and set a new industry standard by using Bornewables™ polypropylene (PP) resins for spunbond and meltblown solutions. Using the certified renewable Bornewables™ polymers in the manufacturing of absorbent hygiene products, from baby diapers to feminine hygiene products, supports the PFNonwovens Group in meeting the growing market demand for more sustainable nonwoven solutions.\n- In May 2023, Borealis introduced the Bornewables™ line Queo™, a range of high-performance polyolefin plastomers and elastomers based on renewable feedstock. Borealis' production location Geleen, the Netherlands, is the production site for Queo™. The facility received the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS) in March 2023, thus enabling Borealis to introduce this new product line. Queo™ represents an expansion of the Bornewables™ portfolio of circular polyolefin products, which offer the same material performance as fossil-based polyolefins yet decoupled from fossil-based feedstock and with reduced carbon emissions. Applications include automotive, flexible and rigid packaging, housewares, and wire and cables.\n- In July 2023, Borealis' polyolefin (PO) compounding site in Monza, Italy, received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS). With the certification of the Monza site, Borealis is now able to offer circular PO products manufactured with renewable feedstocks (Bornewables™) and grades based on chemically recycled feedstock (Borcycle™ C) as part of their Monza PO compounds portfolio.\n- Borealis began exploring carbon capture technologies and the use of carbon dioxide as a resource as an alternative to fossil-based resources. Following the proofs of concept, their target is to scale up these initiatives in 2024.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nBy 2030, OMV plans to establish a production capacity of approximately 2,000 kta of sustainable polymers and other chemicals, including biobased polyolefins. To achieve this, OMV will build up capacity for the procurement of sustainable feedstock and develop and implement a sustainable product portfolio for biobased polyolefins.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

We continuously aim to improve our employees' health and ability to work through integrated health management. We build on sustainable safety measures to protect people by providing a safe and healthy workplace and ensuring the safety and reliability of our plants. We also protect people and assets from the possibility of intentional malicious threats.\n\nOMV's long-term business success is dependent on our ability to continually improve the quality of our business activities while protecting people, the environment, assets, and our reputation. The Health, Safety, and Security strategic focus area emphasizes reducing health and safety risks for OMV employees and customers, as well as protecting assets, information, and operations against any threat. Particularly in times of geopolitical unrest, our Company's resilience is dependent on our emergency and crisis management capabilities.\n\n## Health, Safety, and Well-Being\n\n#### **Material Topic: Health, Safety, and Well-Being**\n\nReducing health and safety risks for OMV employees, customers, and third parties, such as communities, and promoting physical and mental health in an integrative way\n\n#### **Key GRIs NaDiVeG**\n\n- GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018\n- GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety 2016\n\n#### **Most relevant SDGs**\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/13 description: The image contains two icons related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nEnsuring the health, safety, and security of our employees, contractors, and assets is essential for OMV. Employee health and well-being are the foundation for successful company performance, as they are core elements of ensuring the ability to work. OMV aims to adhere to the highest standards to provide its employees and contractors with a safe workplace.\n\nOMV's HSSE vision is \"Committed to Zero Harm – Protect People, Environment, and Assets.\" This vision is embedded in the [HSSE Policy,](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522138560653/dload_HSSE%20Policy_EN) which is OMV's public commitment to health, safety, security, and the environment. Our chemicals subsidiary, Borealis, is committed to implementing the guidelines of the Responsible Care Global Charter, which is the chemical industry's voluntary initiative aimed at continuous improvement in health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nThe OMV Group HSSE strategy sets out the mid-term strategic goals and targets to support the Group's business strategy. The HSSE Strategy 2025 is based on a framework that was developed in 2012 and has since been regularly updated. As the OMV Group comprehensively updated its transformational business strategy (OMV Strategy 2030) in 2022 and bearing in mind the substantial changes ongoing in the regulatory environment, a major review of the HSSE strategy was conducted during 2023, resulting in an updated HSSE Strategy 2030. While proven HSSE management concepts will be continued and further developed, it was identified that HSSE culture, contractor management, and parts of safety and environmental management need a stronger and updated strategic focus over the coming years.\n\nThe strategy revision process included a large number of stakeholders. Changes in the business, specifically the new low-carbon and recycling businesses, were discussed during 13 meetings with the responsible managers of the various areas. A SWOT analysis was conducted over several weeks with numerous subject matter experts and the involvement of over 50 senior managers at two dedicated workshops. The massive emerging changes driven by international regulations, such as sustainability reporting and environmental management, were evaluated to find strategic responses to how to handle them in future. And finally, the proposed updates to the strategy were discussed with all Executive Board members of OMV, OMV\n\nPetrom, and Borealis in a unique half-day on-site workshop. Executive management challenged the proposed strategic targets and provided steering and backing for their implementation.\n\nThe updated HSSE Strategy 2030 is strongly linked to the company Values and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **We care** about safety and the physical and mental well-being of our people; for the planet we live on; for the people we interact with; for our locations and assets.\n- **We're curious** about our future partners, contractors, and technologies so we can develop the business relationship together to achieve the highest HSSE standards.\n- **We progress** to enable the successful transformation of our company toward sustainability and to become the industry leader in HSSE.\n\nWhile we are able to build on a solid foundation for the further strategic development of the various HSSE disciplines and their integration in the business, we have identified key areas that will receive a much higher focus in terms of how we manage HSSE in the business in future.\n\n- The aim is to develop a company culture where HSSE shapes decision-making at any time and at every level, based on highly committed leaders, a competent workforce of employees and contractor employees, and an atmosphere of openness where everybody has the confidence to speak up.\n- Given the high degree of contractor work in our business, we will further strengthen our supplier and contractor management capabilities. We aim to improve the selection process to ensure that only contractors with appropriate HSSE capabilities work with us. When needed, we will put effort (e.g., training, supervision) into helping contractors reach the expected HSSE performance levels. We will focus on long-term relationships with our key contractors based on mutual trust and develop their HSSE culture jointly.\n- We will leverage the opportunities afforded by new technologies to improve our systems and tools to manage HSSE, including product stewardship.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons. The first icon contains a printer symbol. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Overview of the Updates to the HSSE Strategy 2030**\n\nHSSE Strategy 2030\n\nStrategic Goals\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/4 description: The image is a graphic that represents a company's commitment to safety and sustainability. The graphic is shaped like an infinity symbol, with different sections representing different aspects of the company's commitment. The center of the graphic contains the text \"INDUSTRY LEADER 2030\". The left side of the graphic contains the text \"Committed to Zero Harm\", \"Protect People, Environment, and Assets\", \"Culture\", \"Supplier & Contractor Management\", and \"Processes. Regulations. Tools.\". The right side of the graphic contains the text \"Occupational Safety\", \"Health\", \"Product Stewardship\", \"Environment\", \"Process Safety\", and \"Security & Resilience\". There is a picture of workers in the center of the right side of the graphic.\n\nRollout and implementation of the updated HSSE strategy began in Q4/23. The data reported in the OMV Sustainability Report 2023 is therefore still based on the 2025 HSSE strategy.\n\nHSSE management is governed by the internal HSSE Directive, which defines key expectations in compliance with internal HSSE regulations at various levels of the organizational structure, as well as across Group and local functions. This internal Directive sets out the principles and rules for the management of HSSE-related risks and activities throughout the life cycle of the Group's business and activities, including capital projects, mergers, and acquisitions. The Directive also defines key HSSE responsibilities for all OMV Group employees, partners, and contractors. It additionally stipulates the continuous improvement of HSSE performance. The HSSE Directive defines core aspects of HSSE management, grouped into twelve elements revolving around the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. For each element, the HSSE Directive defines the approach to follow for effective HSSE management.\n\nOther corporate regulations governing the topic are HSSE Risk Management, Process Safety Management, Occupational Safety Management, Contractor HSSE Management, Management of Hazardous Substances, and Personnel Transportation, as well as Reporting, Investigation, and\n\nClassification of Incidents, which together provide the framework for safety management. Our Major Accident Prevention Policy sets out the overall aims and guidelines for controlling the risk of a major accident as part of the OMV Group's operations. Acknowledging that the risk of major accidents in onshore or offshore operations related to oil and gas extraction, transportation, refining, and distribution activities is significant, and recognizing that such major accidents can have severe consequences for the environment and affected persons, OMV firmly believes that a strong awareness of HSSE embedded in the company culture is the foundation for all its operations and relationships with contractors. Our Contractor HSSE Management Standard defines the minimum requirements for integrating HSSE issues into all phases of the contract life cycle and into the contractor management process. This standard aims to define a structured process for the HSSE management of contractors, from selection through contract close-out. All 15 Group HSSE regulations have been implemented at Borealis, following an intensive alignment process conducted in 2021.\n\nThe HSSE strategy is implemented by means of annual plans and targets. In a combined top-down and bottom-up process, 43 local annual HSSE plans are developed and monitored centrally.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing and is slightly larger than the house.\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n#### **Core Aspects of HSSE Management**\n\nImage /page/91/Figure/4 description: The image shows a circular diagram of a process with four main stages: Planning, Implementation, Measurement and Evaluation, and Review and Improvement. The stages are arranged in a clockwise direction, with arrows indicating the flow of the process. The diagram also includes the terms \"Plan\", \"Do\", \"Check\", and \"Act\", which are associated with the corresponding stages. The diagram also includes the phrase \"Continuous Improvements\" at the top. The diagram also includes numbered text boxes around the outside of the circle. The text boxes are numbered 1 through 12, and they contain the following text: 1 Leadership and Commitment, 2 Organization, 3 People, Competency, and Behavior, 4 Risk Management, 5 Engineering and Project Management, 6 Operations and Performance Management, 7 Contracted Services, 8 Planning and Cost Management, 9 Incidents and Accidents, 10 Emergency and Crisis Control, 11 Stakeholder Dialogue and Information Management, and 12 Audit and Review.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe health and safety of the people who work for us are key priorities at OMV. The HSSE strategy and its implementation are aligned with and fully embedded in the corporate strategy and the corporate governance structure. Leadership responsibility is assigned to the members of the Executive Board. The Executive Board's remuneration is subject to a Health & Safety Malus (read more in Sustainability Governance). In 2022, focus areas related to safety were defined, with an Executive Board member assigned as the owner of each. For instance, one OMV Executive Board Member serves as the focus topic owner for process safety performance in the OMV Group. In regular update meetings, the owners discuss updates on process safety challenges and achievements.\n\nGroup HSSE is responsible for coordinating health and safety topics across the Group. Group HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The OMV Group HSSE department is organized into specialized teams with experienced experts in the following areas:\n\nDevelopment and implementation of OMV's HSSE VP HSSE at Group level. strategy, regulations, and processes\n\n- HSSE risk assessment\n- Incident investigation\n- HSSE data analysis and reporting\n- Health management\n- Occupational safety management\n- Process safety management\n- Security and resilience management\n- Environmental management\n\nThis is supplemented by local HSSE officers at each site, along with local subject matter experts. For example, at each refinery, we have a dedicated employee who heads the process safety management. This individual is in direct contact with and actively collaborates and communicates with all departments that manage process safety as part of their daily business. This individual also receives process safety guidance from a centralized Process Safety Advisor overseeing the whole of the Refining business unit. In addition, there are HSSE departments at OMV Petrom and Borealis that oversee their specific issues and coordinate their local HSSE officers and experts. The OMV Petrom and Borealis HSSE departments report functionally to the\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nIn line with the HSSE Directive, clear roles and responsibilities are defined for all staff, line management, and senior management. Line management is responsible for ensuring that HSSE issues are integrated into all business decisions and activities. They are required to demonstrate commitment and leadership by acting as role models and taking appropriate measures to control and manage all HSSE risks in their spheres of responsibility. OMV's HSSE management includes interaction with employees or their representatives (works councils, trade unions) as a channel of engagement regarding issues that are particularly important and necessary for improvement. For instance, Borealis has HSE Forums at each location, where employee representatives are consulted and informed about the HSE management system. The HSSE department organizes HSSE Days for OMV's various units to inform employees about HSSE topics.\n\n## Health\n\nThe physical and mental health and well-being of our employees are the foundations for a successful company. Health management at OMV follows both a strategic and an operational system. Its success depends on leadership, commitment, and participation at all levels and functions in the organization, from medical specialists and partners to employees.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nWe have established an OMV health care standard to ensure a high level of care for employee health across the Company. OMV's internal Group Health Standard describes the main principles, roles and responsibilities, and lines of communication within the OMV Group. The standard provides a framework for managing preventive health measures and curative health care, as well as collaboration among HSSE specialists. It supplements local legal requirements, allowing us to establish a harmonized level of health care services and access to medical facilities at all OMV sites.\n\nThe Group Health Standard governs the work of operative medical service providers in relation to the following areas:\n\n- Planning of human resources, medical facilities and services, and local health plans\n- Operational health risk assessment and management, emergency preparedness, preventive initiatives such as targeted health promotion campaigns, health programs and training sessions, and curative care\n- Minimum equipment and materials for our clinics both on land and offshore – such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), defibrillators, suction units, rescue devices, and emergency medication\n- Checks and audits of medical suppliers (laboratories, partner clinics, pharmacies), hygiene in food facilities, customer satisfaction\n- Reporting\n- Collaboration with contractors and subcontractors on health and safety\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nOMV applies its own risk management standard, which provides for a thorough assessment of possible risks, including health-related risks. We have therefore developed guidelines – based on international guidelines from IOGP/Ipieca – for health risk assessments covering such risks as harm from chemical agents, psychological strain, physical injuries, and others.\n\n#### **Preventive Care**\n\nOMV maintains or works with a total of 45 medical units across all locations where we have operating facilities. To mitigate occupational health risks, our medical staff carries out specific preventive examinations in accordance with the legal regulations of the countries in which we operate. These examinations include blood tests for employees working with specific hazardous substances and hearing tests for employees exposed to noise. We offer general health screenings to our workforce. In 2023, a voluntary screening and check-up service for cardiovascular issues was offered to all OMV Group colleagues based at the head office in Vienna, and similar check-ups were offered at many other clinics for employees in other workplaces and countries. In addition, we run seasonal campaigns to provide free vaccinations against flu and tick-borne encephalitis in affected areas. In 2023, COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters were offered once again.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nA special health audit program developed by the Corporate Health Management department serves as an evaluation tool to ensure that our common corporate health care standard is implemented and followed throughout the Group. The program stipulates that all clinics and medical partners be audited every three years, and clinics also report on a self-conducted audit every year. In 2023, after most of the COVID-19 related travel restrictions were lifted, Corporate Health Management was once again able to perform health audits in Romania, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Serbia, and Bulgaria; all other clinics carried out selfaudits. Audit results serve as the basis for identifying areas for further improvement and analyzing the effectiveness of our health management approach.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### **Community Engagement**\n\nThe presence of OMV's first aid facilities benefits the local population, as it often provides necessary medical help in remote areas where medical services might not be easily or quickly accessible (e.g., in Yemen). In 2023, OMV's first aid facilities supported 1,737 individuals in the local population in need of urgent care. From this perspective, our assistance to the local population ensures a positive impact outside OMV's operational boundaries, thereby contributing to building a good relationship with our neighbors. Read more about our engagement on SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being, in the Community Investments section.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn 2023, COVID-19 prevention was still on the agenda of medical staff in some countries (e.g., Romania, Germany, and Austria), where it was legally possible for vaccinations to be administered at workplaces.\n\n- **15** clinics audited by OMV Corporate Health<sup>20</sup>\n- **51,729** voluntary health screenings<sup>20</sup>\n- **5,352** vaccinations<sup>20</sup>\n- **102,518** medical consultations<sup>20</sup>\n- **17,582** occupational health examinations<sup>20</sup>\n- **21,887** physiotherapy treatments<sup>20</sup>\n- **1,864** psychological consultations<sup>20</sup>\n\nIn fall 2023, doctors and other health care professionals came together and discussed the main challenges, such as mental health issues and the latest developments in emergency medicine. The focus topics for preventive care for 2023 were discussed and a plan for implementation developed.\n\nEvery year, we organize health promotion activities to enhance the knowledge of our employees on healthrelated issues.\n\n- At the Health Circle in Gänserndorf, Austria, employees gather regularly to address work-related health issues and create customized solutions in collaboration with the local health team.\n- The Corporate Health and Learning departments have developed a new collaborative initiative to raise awareness of health issues over the last few years. In 2023, webinars were held focusing on issues such as ideas for achieving a better work-life balance, while another was organized to discuss the promotion of mental health.\n\nLocally in some countries, face-to-face health promotion sessions were able to take place, with the main topics including a breast cancer awareness campaign that continued in Romania and offers free and voluntary breast ultrasounds, followed by the availability of a specialist doctor examination in case of abnormalities.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn collaboration with a task force from the health committee of IOGP/Ipieca, we will elaborate a guideline and training materials for the relationship between mental health and leadership. Emphasis will be placed on raising awareness of this relationship and how to improve it. The first pilot training session are scheduled to for the second half of 2024 so that training can be organized at all our workplaces starting in 2025.\n\n#### Occupational Safety\n\nOMV aims to adhere to the highest standards to provide its employees and contractors with a safe workplace. This is not only a moral obligation but also necessary for seamless operations, without costly shutdowns or delays due to incidents.\n\nThe OMV Group's Reporting, Investigation, and Classification of Incidents Standard clearly outlines the systematic approach to be followed (beyond local/national laws) and the regulations and roles, responsibilities when notifying, reporting, investigating, and classifying incidents within the OMV Group, together with identifying appropriate preventive and corrective actions. OMV Group's HSSE Directive covers all HSSE terms and definitions, including work-related injuries for all OMV Group employees and contractors.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Procedures**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments and Audits**\n\nMajor risks and the respective mitigation measures are evaluated and monitored within the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process, and documented in a Group-wide database (Active Risk Management System; ARMS). They are reported to top management twice a year or as necessary whenever issues arise. Senior management are directly involved in the review of risks identified as a top priority. Sites are audited regularly based on a Group-wide HSSE audit program. For example, in 2023 we had an HSSE Management System Audit at the Burghausen refinery. The audit showed good implementation and application of the 12 HSSE management elements. Recommendations from the audit contributes to continuous improvement.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### **Incident Reporting and Investigation**\n\nAll employees and contractors are encouraged to bring any unsafe conditions and behaviors to the attention of line management in order for them to identify and resolve potential issues that might otherwise lead to future incidents or accidents. We acknowledge these suggestions for improvement submitted by employees and contractors locally.\n\nAll incidents, hazards, HSSE walks, audits, findings, and defined actions are reported and tracked within a central HSSE reporting tool (OMV Synergi). Online training is regularly organized via the My Success Factors learning platform to ensure the effective use of the tool, e.g., by highlighting the importance of the quality of data input.\n\nDashboards for the most significant HSSE data and relevant KPIs (e.g., LTIs, TRIs, HiPos, process safety events, and action status) have been set up and made available to various management levels Group-wide. Since 2016, all Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events have been transferred to our centralized reporting tool to enable trend analysis and sharing of findings from past events. Our aim here was to increase awareness of OMV Synergi entries to boost their quality and transparency, and to improve data owner accountability.\n\nWe continue to investigate incidents and accidents using the knowledge of our incident investigator pool members and other technical experts. In 2023, we again trained more than 104 colleagues during a one-day incident investigation training session. In addition to the training, a Community of Practice Meeting was organized for incident investigators. This event is used for communicating experiences and findings from incident investigations across the Group.\n\nOur aim regarding incident investigation is to find the root causes of incidents and to carry out suitable and necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of more severe incidents in the future. Here, the focus is not only on incidents that have occurred but also on near misses that, under slightly different circumstances, could have the potential to lead to serious accidents. In parallel, the focus remains on verifying the effectiveness of actions implemented in previous years after severe and high-potential incidents (HiPos), including process safety incidents. In this way, OMV Synergi is updated with information about safety events that have happened over the last few years to help foster learning from past incidents. The incident investigation process has been further developed, and a subprocess to share HSSE information and promote our lessons learned as an organization has also been established. Our Incident Investigation Panel meets quarterly to obtain a\n\nclear overview of the whole process and to implement practical measures for its improvement.\n\n#### **Training, Awareness Raising, and Safety Promotion Activities**\n\nAll staff are required to be familiar with the HSSE Policy, internal HSSE regulations, and relevant legislation. They actively contribute to and further develop HSSE awareness as part of our corporate culture, for example by stopping and reporting unsafe or irresponsible acts and conditions and reporting any incidents and non-compliance. OMV employees at all levels are regularly trained in their roles and responsibilities.\n\nEducation and training are important for informing workers and managers about workplace hazards and controls so they can work more safely and be more productive. After the update and Group-wide alignment of our Life-Saving Rules (LSR), we ran an intensive program of face-to-face rollout workshops led by line management to reach all employees and contractor employees. Furthermore, the LSR are presented and discussed regularly during awareness programs, workshops, management walk-arounds, and safety walks, as well as during various meetings. Practical LSR training will be continued and delivered systematically in the Safety Centers, for which the training concept and material have been fully reviewed and updated. Based on this, existing Safety Centers will be redeveloped, and new ones created in 2024.\n\nWe believe that promoting an open dialogue and establishing a culture in which health and safety are integrated into every employee's role are effective ways to empower people to work safely. Workers are engaged in initiating, implementing, evaluating, and improving health and safety programs. They work closely with their managers to find joint solutions to common problems, which helps managers pinpoint issues while motivating and encouraging workers to improve their own safety. To concentrate on quality over quantity in terms of reporting, HSSE walks, safety walks, and action close-outs continued throughout 2023. In addition, efforts to make safety a top priority in the minds of employees were continued. More attention is focused on improving the HSSE walks and safety walks by encouraging open dialogue while they're in progress. This promotes understanding of the challenges in the operating fields and increases trust between the workforce and management.\n\n#### **Focus on Contractor Safety**\n\nThe safety of our contractors is just as important as the safety of our own employees. For this reason, we have established processes that require contractors to work according to our standards. Our Contractor HSSE Management Process begins when we issue the scope of work\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle with an arrow going around it.\n\nwith information about HSSE requirements and the HSSE key performance indicators (KPIs). The process continues through the tender stage with the HSSE evaluation and capability audit, if needed. Once the contract terms are agreed and the contract is awarded, and before work begins at the site, we reinforce our expectations and requirements during kick-off meetings, HSSE induction, site specific training, and other joint meetings.\n\nThe presence of contractors at our sites is monitored around the clock using an electronic registration system (e.g., in the refineries) or paper sign-in system (e.g., attendance sheet, permit to work, and induction sheet). During the contract period, we monitor our contractors by way of audits, inspections, joint HSSE or safety walks, service quality meetings, forums, and workshops, using the outcomes to share information and encourage improvement of our HSSE performance as a team. To increase the awareness and knowledge of contract owners, contract holders (i.e., the beneficiaries in need of external services), procurement staff, and HSSE experts regarding our Contractor HSSE Management Process, we have continued to deliver specific training explaining how HSSE requirements and tools are embedded in the source-to-contract process. Having trained over 800 people on Contractor HSSE Management between 2019 and 2022, the training program continued with e-learning and webinars, as well as individual coaching and counseling for selected sourcing projects. Contract owners, contract holders, and procurement staff were the main target group of these training sessions.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**37%** of our sites are certified to ISO 45001 (covering **29%** of OMV employees).\n\n**91** formal joint health and safety committees comprising management and worker representatives were organized at OMV Group sites.\n\n**44,001** unsafe conditions and behavior reports were received in our reporting tool.\n\nIn 2023, the number of injured personnel increased among both our own employees and those of contractors. This trend is not only evident within OMV, but also across the whole industry, according to the IOGP position statement \"2022 safety trends and responses\" dated February 2023. The main reasons for the deterioration of the key safety indicators of our industry include:\n\nlingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n- a clear increase in industry activity, with associated aggressive hiring and reduction in collective experience levels\n- geopolitical situation, both in terms of direct stress on both individuals and their organizations, and the workload increase due to energy security imperatives.\n\nTo take countermeasures and to improve safety and bring it back to the highest level, various activities and programs have been carried out:\n\n- In our operations, motivational management and practical training is a key topic to encourage positive behavior. For example, during the 2023 turnaround at the Schwechat refinery and polyolefin production facility, where more than 6,000 contractor employees were on duty every day, special safety behavior was praised and encouraged with a selection of small goodies. More than a thousand foremen were also given practical training in the specially built safety training centers in order to act as a multiplier for safety on site. This helped improve the relationship between the workforce and management and also encouraged safe behavior, leading to an overall positive impact at our sites.\n- A big focus here is on Contractor Safety Improvement. Safety programs with the aim of consolidating and improving safety performance were implemented with a wide variety of contractors. In order to underline their importance, they are supported and managed by senior management as a sponsor.\n- In line with our \"Committed to Zero Harm\" vision, Borealis developed and implemented stringent measures to improve our safety performance. These include the new B-Safe program, which involves employees and supervisors of main contractors participating in either a three-day training course (all leaders including top management) or a one-day training course (all other employees). The program focuses on proactive intervention to prevent safety incidents, risk identification measures, learning from past incidents, and promoting a heightened awareness of the importance of looking out for others while working.\n- In order to create a better common understanding of what motivates the employees in their daily safety work and, on the other hand, what expectations management has with regard to safety work, the \"Day with the crew\" initiative was launched at OMV Petrom.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer symbol. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- In order to draw further attention to the topic of health and safety, on May 2 and 3, 2023, we held a Groupwide session to celebrate the UN World Day for Safety and Health at Work. Around 850 colleagues participated in the two action-packed days at the head office in Vienna. During the event, we informed the participants about the know-how required to optimize workspaces when working from home and how to get your bike fit for the new season. In addition, \"Driving\" was chosen from the OMV Life-Saving Rules as a focus topic. Additional safety days were held at the various locations, where theory and practice were combined. This was an additional great opportunity for both our own and contractor employees to discuss health and safety in a practical way.\n- The incident investigation panel meets quarterly and consists of the divisional HSSE Managers, the Incident Investigation & Analysis Advisor, the VP HSSE, and the Head of Coordination & Implementation HSSE. They ensure:\n\t- the quality of incident investigation reports\n\t- the effectiveness of the defined actions\n\n**Lost-Time Injury Rate**\n\n- event frequency and trend analysis is reviewed\n- focus areas for lessons learned are defined and communicated\n- To improve the incident investigation process and ensure that the new incident investigators get the right support, we started 2023 with an Incident Investigators Community of Practice Experience sharing session across the whole OMV Group. This will be continued regularly in 2024.\n- In 2023, action close out focus audits were performed to ensure the continuous improvement process. The specific objectives were to audit the close out of actions resulting from incident investigations and to audit the sharing within the organization and to contractors of (technical/safety) alerts and lessons learned. Regrettably, however, one of our contractor colleagues at an OMV-operated venture lost their life in 2023 during the course of their work for OMV. The contractor colleague in Romania died from injuries sustained during a fire. OMV feels this loss deeply and are determined to learn from this incident, and do everything possible to prevent anything similar from happening again. We continue to work closely with our contractors to help build a strong safety culture at the front line.\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/10 description: The image is a bar chart comparing the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked for employees and contractors from 2019 to 2023. The x-axis represents the years from 2019 to 2023. The y-axis represents the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked. For employees, the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.51 in 2019, 0.43 in 2020, 0.70 in 2021, 1.13 in 2022, and 1.04 in 2023. For contractors, the number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.27 in 2019, 0.27 in 2020, 0.51 in 2021, 0.62 in 2022, and 0.80 in 2023. The total number of incidents per 1 million hours worked was 0.34 in 2019, 0.32 in 2020, 0.57 in 2021, 0.78 in 2022, and 0.87 in 2023.\n\n\\* 2022 figure restated due to reclassification of a case after the audit in 2023.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nThe HSSE strategy is implemented by means of annual plans and targets. In a combined top-down and bottom-up process, 43 local annual HSSE plans are developed and monitored centrally.\n\nThe occupational safety focus points for the 2024 HSSE plan include:\n\n## **Total Recordable Injury Rate**\n\nPer 1 mn hours worked\n\n- improvements in HSSE culture,\n- motivational management,\n- training and competencies,\n- contractor performance and subcontractor management, and\n- safe behavior and compliance.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The fundamental components of this include our organization, resources, management processes, people and equipment performance, the prevailing safety culture, and documented regulations and practices. It covers the management of hazards associated with the chemical and physical properties of the substances we handle in our oil, gas, and chemical activities. OMV and Borealis process large quantities of flammable and/or toxic materials at high pressures and temperatures that, if not properly handled, could potentially lead to serious process safety incidents. In a worst-case scenario, leaks, fires, or explosions could also cause fatalities. Further consequences include a substantial disruption to the supply to customers, along with additional costs. The OMV Group's Process Safety Management Standard serves as a framework and reference for the implementation and maintenance of effective process safety regulations.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has implemented comprehensive measures to ensure process safety, as detailed below.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nProcess safety risks are systematically assessed through a variety of process hazard assessments such as HAZOP studies, QRAs (Quantitative Risk Assessments), and risk assessments according to the Seveso Directive, which is the main EU regulation dealing with the control of onshore major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.\n\nRecommendations from process hazard analyses (PHAs), audits, reviews, and incident investigations addressing process safety risks are centrally recorded and prioritized systematically in the OMV Group Integrated Risk Register. This is linked to the mid-term planning process to ensure there is budget available to address the recommendations.\n\nPrior to the start-up of a new facility, after major modifications, or following a turnaround, we conduct an independent pre-start-up safety review to ensure that the facility is safe for start-up and operations.\n\n#### **Emergency Management Plans**\n\nProcess safety incidents could at times affect communities in the vicinity of our operations. For this reason, we have robust emergency management plans in place that are coordinated with the surrounding communities.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue circular icons. The first icon contains a printer. The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nDifferent levels of emergency management plans outline roles and responsibilities, structures, communications, and the interfaces required for emergency and incident management teams. Emergency response plans include specific emergency procedures and alerting and notification requirements to ensure that an emergency response is managed in a coordinated manner.\n\n#### **Inspection and Maintenance**\n\nComprehensive inspection and maintenance programs are carried out by dedicated departments for inspection, maintenance, and plant integrity. They conduct regular inspections of process equipment, pipelines, tanks, and more, and manage safety equipment testing plus plant maintenance and turnarounds.\n\n#### **Investigations and Audits**\n\nAll incidents are identified and reported in an appropriate and timely manner. Work-related incidents with potential consequences for people, the environment, assets, or our reputation are investigated in a suitable manner to determine direct causes, root causes, and systemic causes so we can learn from them and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events<sup>21</sup> are measured each year for a consistent overview of the OMV Group's process safety performance. In addition to Tier 1 and 2 process safety incidents, we monitor Tier 3 process safety events for a better assessment of the critical barriers. The monitoring and reporting of Tier 3 events provides an overview of the challenges to safety systems so that weaknesses within the barriers can be identified and corrected at facility level.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nEmployee competence in the field of process safety is ensured by a well-defined training plan, as well as continuous communication of process safety topics and the sharing of lessons learned and other relevant process safety information. Scenario-based emergency drills involving the site emergency management team are conducted periodically in the refineries in addition to regular drills carried out by the fire service.\n\nWe have set up an OMV Group Process Safety Network and created an online collaboration platform that includes a reference library, discussion board, and other features. We host regular virtual sessions to exchange process safety knowledge across the Group, with participants coming from a variety of OMV countries and working in different fields of expertise. This helps foster continuous learning. Top management participation in these online sessions sends a clear message that process safety is important and demonstrates process safety leadership and commitment.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nIn 2023, the number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events increased slightly. The following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n#### **Process Safety Events, Tier 1 and Tier 2**\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/14 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Number of events\". The x-axis shows the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The y-axis shows the number of events. There are two categories of events, Tier 1 and Tier 2. In 2019, there were 4 Tier 1 events and 7 Tier 2 events. In 2020, there were 6 Tier 1 events and 13 Tier 2 events. In 2021, there were 10 Tier 1 events and 17 Tier 2 events. In 2022, there were 9 Tier 1 events and 16 Tier 2 events. In 2023, there were 12 Tier 1 events and 15 Tier 2 events.\n\n- A register containing risk reduction measures identified in various process hazard analyses (PHAs), assessments, and safety studies was established in each operated production unit and was populated with data, including from Borealis sites. This provides a consolidated overview to support prioritization and further development of risk reduction plans.\n- The key process safety performance indicators (PSPI) were updated for the OMV Group, and a dashboard was developed to inform management.\n- The Advanced Risk Assessment (ARA) software, a cloud-based tool for process hazard analyses, recommendation tracking, and workflows, was rolled out at OMV.\n- A process safety management (PSM) assessment was carried out offshore in OMV's Energy business segment.\n- A safety deep dive on pre-start-up safety review (PSSR) and pressure testing hazard control in the Schwechat refinery was conducted.\n- Periodic Group Process Safety Committee meetings with Executive Board member involvement took place, where process safety performance, achievements, and challenges were on the agenda.\n- The Group-wide process safety knowledge- and experience-sharing platform was continued, with quarterly half-day events where up to 200 individuals participate in virtual meetings and presentations, including contributions from senior management. The yearly Process Safety Day, a full-day event of sharing experiences and learning, was also held.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/1 description: The image shows a paragraph of text describing the OMV Energy segment. The text states that the OMV Energy segment completed a digital Maintenance and Integrity Dashboard that provides an overview of compliance with safety-critical equipment maintenance while also displaying up-to-date maintenance statistics.\n\n- The OMV Energy segment has been utilizing the newest technologies on the market to inspect pipelines that are usually difficult to access.\n- Tier 1 and 2 analyses were performed at Borealis. The results were presented to the Borealis Process Safety Committee and key focus areas were identified based on the analysis.\n- Borealis carried out a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) in Beringen, and the results were communicated to the local management team (LLT). An action plan is being developed.\n- At Borealis, \"blue audits\" were conducted as planned at the following sites: Burghausen (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), Stenungsund HC & PO (Sweden), and Itatiba (Brazil). The results will be presented to the local management teams and the Operation Assurance Committee.\n- Borealis started the rollout of a Process Safety Roadmap, which is a five-year plan of critical Process Safety activities needed to close identified gaps in process safety management, in a structured way across all locations, followed by training.\n- Borealis continued to develop the Group's process safety competency by conducting Process Safety in Design and Hazard Study Leader training and following up with Process Safety Basics e-learning, which the OMV Group shared with Borealis.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nTo continue to improve our process safety performance, we will take the following actions in the coming years:\n\n- We will continue to thoroughly analyze and learn from process safety events and promote the sharing of knowledge across all our divisions.\n- We aim to reduce the number of process safety events at all our sites across the globe. Our continued efforts will focus on process hazard analyses (PHAs), the implementation of technical risk reduction measures identified in those PHAs, audits, and other process safety assessments, while maintaining and monitoring the performance of existing safeguards.\n- We will continue to develop and follow process safety roadmaps, i.e., five-year plans with activities in the area of process safety, at facility level, and to define and plan necessary process safety activities for upcoming years. Process safety roadmaps help to ensure that key aspects of the process safety management system are delivered.\n- We will enhance our tools to identify and assess hazards more effectively and address these risks in a systematic way.\n- We will continually improve our training provision and will emphasize process safety content to build process safety competence and culture in the workforce and increase risk awareness.\n- Borealis will continue process safety event (PSE) Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysis and expand it to Tier 3 events, including an impact assessment to identify the greatest opportunities for risk reduction and develop an action plan.\n- The Borealis HSSE group will perform internal health checks on process safety-related elements and a process safety review as part of the Borealis blue audits.\n- Borealis will conduct Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) in Stenungsund, Sweden, to evaluate all possible release scenarios in terms of probability and consequences, and to identify risk profiles at various locations inside and outside the site, with the aim of reducing the overall exposure of employees and contractors.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The target is to \"Maintain leading position in Process Safety Event Rate.\" The status in 2023 is \"0.2322\". The most relevant SDG is SDG 3, which is \"Good Health and Well-Being\", represented by a logo with a heart and a heartbeat line.\n\n**SDG target:**\n\n**3.9** By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination\n\n## Product Safety\n\nOMV assumes responsibility for delivering safe, highquality products. At the same time, we continuously work on exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of the life cycle of our products. We take a holistic approach to product safety, with technologically advanced solutions used to deliver safe, top-quality products, at the same time as taking action to ensure the responsible use of our products.\n\nProduct safety is also particularly important for our C&M segment, which encompasses our chemicals subsidiary Borealis. When not properly handled, chemical substances, or products containing them, can pose risks to health, safety, and the environment. These risks include potentially negative health effects such as sensitization, irritation, or intoxication; physical hazards such as fires, explosions, or exposure to dust; and environmental hazards such as bioaccumulation or persistence.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur internal Management of Hazardous Substances standard stipulates measures to ensure regulatory compliance and guarantee that risk assessments are conducted for all products or for hazardous substances contained in products.\n\n#### **REACH Compliance**\n\nWe have established appropriate processes and workflows to ensure our compliance with EU regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) and on the Classification, Labelling, and Packaging (CLP) of substances and mixtures, as well as with\n\nthe Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States. We are committed to maintaining and updating our mandatory registrations to keep up with relevant regulatory developments. To this end, we closely follow the guidance published by the European Chemicals Agency and participate in the REACH consortia (Concawe, Lower Olefins and Aromatics, Fuel Ethers, Co-processed Refinery Products, Phenol and Derivatives, Melamine, FARM [Fertilizer and Related Materials], Eurogypsum, etc.), as well as in working groups through oil and chemical industry trade associations.\n\nIn addition to keeping REACH registrations up to date, Borealis also follows the developments on authorizations and restrictions under REACH, such as the planned restriction with regards to synthetic polymer microparticles (better known as microplastics). The drafted restriction foresees a ban on placing products containing microplastics on the market but derogates the use of plastic pellets on industrial sites. However, there are planned supply chain communication and reporting obligations toward the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) that will apply for Borealis polyolefin products.\n\n#### **Banned Substances**\n\nBorealis has a Banned Substances List that contains more than 220 substances and substance groups that may not be used in our production processes and products. The Banned Substances List can be found on the [Borealis web](https://www.borealisgroup.com/company/chemicals-safety/hazardous-chemicals/borealis-banned-substances)[site.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/company/chemicals-safety/hazardous-chemicals/borealis-banned-substances)\n\n#### **Responsible Care®**\n\nBorealis is committed to the principles of Responsible Care® and enforces high product stewardship standards to\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nensure that its products do not pose a risk at any stage along the value chain.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nBorealis has adopted a hazardous chemicals strategy. This follows the precautionary principle of continuously assessing the risk potential of all substances used in Borealis' products to identify critical chemicals no longer permitted to be used or that can be replaced by safer alternatives. This includes all substances that were already classified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) according to REACH and other comparable legislation outside the EU, or that fulfill the criteria to be considered as SVHCs in the future. The risk evaluation utilizes a tailormade analysis and assessment tool that ranks the substances according to their overall risk. It considers related HSE risks and regulatory aspects, evolving stakeholder concerns, the technical feasibility of substitution, and the financial consequences of doing so, such as the costs of required innovation, approval, and modifications to technical equipment. Substances with the highest identified risk are further assessed by the Product Stewardship Council. The Council selects the substances to be evaluated using the Borealis Risk Matrix, which is a proprietary ranking tool to evaluate risks in detail. These assessments enable Borealis to identify, mitigate, and manage the risks posed by hazardous chemicals.\n\n#### **Quality Control**\n\nAll incoming chemicals used in Borealis' products are assessed, rated, and documented to ensure legal compliance before they are approved for use. Local teams then perform additional assessments at each plant to ensure the chemicals meet plant-specific requirements and comply with national or community-related legislation. This process ensures that the procurement organization does not purchase any substance before Group Product Stewardship has reviewed and approved it. Once materials are approved for purchase, they are subject to Borealis' quality control measures to ensure they continue to comply with the agreed material properties. Detailed information is documented for all materials regarding their composition and their hazardous constituents. Proper documentation of the raw materials used is a key element of high-quality Borealis product compliance statements, such as safety data sheets (SDSs) and application-related statements, including those on medical use, food contact, drinking water, and the origin of raw materials.\n\n#### **Safety Data Sheets**\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) are available on the [OMV](http://www.omv.com/en/products/online-tools/product-information) and [Borealis](https://www.borealisgroup.com/products/product-catalogue) websites. These documents are regulated under REACH and include comprehensive information on potential health, safety, and environmental issues. In addition, they inform customers and employees about how to handle and use our products safely. Borealis actively follows its suppliers' SDSs and the harmonized classification process to ensure it always has accurate and upto-date SDS and label information for our products.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe OMV Group aims to become a global leader in circular economy solutions with a strong focus on increasing the use of sustainable fuels (e.g., Sustainable Aviation Fuel; SAF) and renewable feedstocks.\n\nBorealis' activities regarding the circular economy and exploring sustainable feedstock result in new product safety and compliance aspects to consider and solve. Both existing and planned legal frameworks, for example following the EU Commission's Green Deal, require industry and brand owners to use post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials for their products. Group Product Stewardship is providing support by generating an overview of applicable legislation and available industry standards to produce a risk assessment and analytical testing strategy so we can confirm compliance and the suitability of Borealis' Circular Economy Solutions portfolio.\n\n#### In 2023, Borealis\n\n- categorized different types of recyclate feedstock for mechanical recycling and defined the required compliance and safety documents and analytical testing for each category;\n- used a newly implemented IT tool to report relevant products to the EU Poison Centres, prior to the deadline for industrial use mixtures with certain human health hazards;\n- prepared registration dossiers for about 50% of the substances imported to Turkey, enabling continued market access for Borealis' product portfolio after the official postponement of the registration deadline from end 2023 to 2026 and beyond;\n- assessed and implemented the new requirements for plastics that come into contact with food in the EU, Switzerland, China, Japan, and the Mercosur region across its food contact product portfolio by providing updated Declaration of Compliance with Food Contact Regulations documents to customers; and\n- confirmed that all substances in Borealis products that come into contact with drinking water are listed in the draft positive list for starting materials, additives, and process chemicals for such materials in the EU.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

All icons are blue.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nOur Group objective is to drive sustainability by minimizing the potential hazards and risks associated with our portfolio. In 2024, the OMV Group will:\n\ngenerate and provide data to enable the EU authorities to make informed decisions on legislation that is under review, such as the REACH Regulation, the Food Contact Regulation, and the Drinking Water Directive and its national implementation;\n\n## Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience\n\n- continue to implement the requirements of new legislation globally, including continued preparation work for registration in Turkey, registration of 100–1,000 t substances in South Korea, and support for customers in Taiwan with the registration of PEC 1 substances; and\n- ensure that REACH registrations for cracker feedstock also cover higher percentages of alternative non-fossil feedstock than currently described by the Concawe consortium.\n\n#### **Material Topic: Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience**\n\nProtecting people, assets, operations, information, and reputation against any threats, incidents, or crises, thereby ensuring business continuity\n\n- GRI 410: Security Practices 2016\n\n#### **Key GRI NaDiVeG**\n\nGRI 410: Security Practices 2016 Employee and social concerns\n\n#### **Most relevant SDG**\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/16 description: The image is a square with a blue background. In the upper left corner is the number 16 in white. To the right of the number is the text \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\" in white. Below the text is a white dove holding an olive branch in its beak. Below the dove is a white gavel.\n\nThe purpose of OMV's security activities is to protect the OMV Group's personnel, assets, information, operations, value, and reputation against threats. The Security, Emergency, and Crisis Resilience material topic encompasses two facets: corporate physical security and information security.\n\nOMV's core commitments to security are laid out in the HSSE Policy. We protect against crime, malicious acts arising from geopolitical threats, and business crime. Furthermore, we develop resilience to respond to and recover from incidents and ensure business continuity.\n\n#### Governance\n\nGroup HSSE is responsible for coordinating physical security and resilience activities across the OMV Group. Group HSSE is led by the VP HSSE, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. In high-risk countries, we have dedicated Country Security Managers and Asset Protection Experts on site to add additional expertise. IT Security is handled by the Group IT & Digital Office led by the Chief Information Officer. The CIO reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The Group CIO is\n\nsupported by the Group CISO and Group IT/OT Governance team.\n\n### Corporate Security\n\nAn unstable geopolitical environment in 2023 combined with complex new and ongoing regional conflicts, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe, resulted in Corporate Security continuing to invest significant resources in ensuring resilience and security in areas that we had previously considered low risk, but without losing focus on our employees and assets in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to the challenges of operating securely in Yemen, Tunisia, and Libya, the enduring threat of terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere has not diminished. Political extremism, organized crime, and the increasing convergence of cyber risks with physical threats necessitated the Corporate Security department's unrelenting focus on a robust yet flexible security strategy to enable OMV to continue operating in dynamic environments with asymmetric threats.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group's internal Security Management Standard lays out a comprehensive range of security regulations, plans, procedures, measures, and systems. The document utilizes the IOGP best practice guidelines, along with other industry best practice (ASIS and UK Security Institute), to enable the OMV Group to more effectively detect, deter, protect against, prevent, record, and investigate threats. Corporate guidelines on Issue Motivated Groups (IMGs) were updated, as was a position paper on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nThe OMV Group has a unique, agile, and proven security management system that is regularly reviewed, amended, or enhanced as the situation requires.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nThe philosophy of collecting security information and assessing it as a preventive security instrument remains a fundamental principle of the Corporate Security strategy. This concept affords us the ability to anticipate or instantly respond to a broad spectrum of geopolitical events, regional conflicts, and isolated incidents. Effective interaction with government and local security agencies further augments this approach with the reliable corroboration of facts on the ground.\n\nOMV's security risk assessment platform continues to provide real-time oversight of OMV's asset risk exposure levels and can be quickly adjusted in response to geopolitical or security events, as well as enabling the dissemination of security-critical information in real time.\n\n#### **Human Rights and Community Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group's human rights policies and actions remain crucial to guaranteeing a secure and harmonious working environment. We provide human rights training to local security employees and third-party contractors. Effective community engagement at a local level remains a powerful security mitigation measure in regions experiencing conflict or instability. In high-risk countries, OMV's local security and community engagement strategies are tightly integrated, promoting effective policies, mutual respect, and transparency with all local stakeholders. In turn, they contributed directly to OMV's stable and secure operating environment in 2023. This cooperation encourages a precautionary approach to early detection and resolution of local grievances.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness of security practices within OMV's business units, the OMV Corporate Security function conducts audits every year for those ventures deemed high risk (for 2023 this was Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen). Two other major audits are conducted annually, with business units being chosen based on operational requirements. In 2023, the selected areas were OMV NZ and the OMV DE Burghausen refinery and associated Tank Farms.\n\nTerms of Reference are agreed with the business unit prior to commencing the audit. A thorough review then takes place including site visits, interviews, document analysis, and observations. An audit report is then drafted, shared, agreed, and published. The report will include SMART actions, with the entire process being tracked via OMV's HSSE tool Synergi.\n\n#### **Resilience**\n\nIn the OMV Group, the term \"resilience\" covers incident, emergency, crisis, and business continuity management and, even though the Resilience function sits within the Group Security & Resilience department, the focus is not exclusively on security incidents. It covers all sorts of events involving people, environment, assets, information, and reputation, where the OMV Group has legal, ethical, or community responsibilities, or business interests.\n\nAccording to the Group-wide Resilience Standard, the OMV Group uses a three-tier approach for the management of incidents, emergencies, and crises by way of dedicated teams at different levels of the organization (Incident Management Teams, Emergency Management Teams, Crisis Management Teams). The key priorities in any such situation are to:\n\n- Protect and save life through a strong focus on the ability to account for people\n- Minimize damage to the environment\n- Protect assets and information from further damage\n- Minimize business interruptions\n- Minimize financial and legal liability\n- Protect or enhance reputation\n\nIn order to maintain a high level of preparedness, the incident, emergency, and crisis management plans and procedures are tested and the respective team members trained and exercised at regular intervals.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe Corporate Security department continued to deliver operational support to OMV ventures globally, as well as surge capacity during security challenges. In high-risk countries, OMV also utilized dedicated Country Security Managers and Asset Protection Experts on site to enhance\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

This set of tools provides guidance on risk assessment, public safety and security, human rights abuses, and the interaction between companies and private and public security. OMV is committed to upholding human rights in all of its activities. In 2023, OMV Corporate Security completed its application to VPSHR and attended its annual conference in London. OMV is currently awaiting the results of its application.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nOMV will continue its engagement with the VPSHR initiative and aims to become a dedicated member.\n\n### Information and Cybersecurity\n\nIn an increasingly interconnected global environment, information is exposed to a rapidly growing variety of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. The OMV Group invests in information and cybersecurity to protect technology, assets, critical information, and our reputation, and to avoid any damage or financial loss resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and data. Keeping the OMV Group free of security vulnerabilities and potential security risks is essential for the whole business.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nOur internal IT23/OT<sup>24</sup> Security Directive lays out the details of the IT/OT Security Framework, through which topic- or security domain-related security standards and policies are continually aligned and managed. The Security Framework consists of approximately 50 regulatory documents in total and is harmonized with the ISO 27000 series (ISO27k) of recommendations for IT controls and domains. It also covers OMV's commitment to securing the operation of its services in dedicated areas, such as within the filling stations retail business and the related PCI DSS<sup>25</sup> requirements.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nWe run an Information Security Management System (ISMS), which is based on ISO27k standards and certified accordingly, with external monitoring and recertification processes carried out annually. A full recertification assessment was successfully completed in July 2022 and the OMV certification period was extended until 2025. One of the basic principles of an ISMS is incorporating a continuous improvement cycle in order to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remediate potential information security leaks or weaknesses.\n\n#### **Preventive, Technical, Detective, and Reactive Measures**\n\nWe lower the risk of security breaches by introducing new tools, individual detection strategies, and response plans in order to maintain a strong perimeter for our physical and our cloud environment.\n\nTechnical housekeeping measures ensure a solid foundation with up-to-date hardware and software, as well as adequate information security processes. We implement security patches and offer guidelines in order to provide consistent hardware and software life cycles.\n\nDetective and reactive measures are designed and executed on an ongoing basis to create transparency around existing risks, security gaps, and vulnerabilities. In order to protect our assets and keep intruders out, we integrate detective and reactive measures to mitigate possible damage and take remediation measures to ensure a fast and total recovery. Examples of such measures include:\n\n- Permanent vulnerability scans on cyber assets\n- Breach and attack simulations to evaluate potential attack surfaces\n- Running continuous internal and external penetration tests on critical applications/systems\n- External audits as quality assurance (ISO27k, PCI-DSS NIS, etc.)\n\n#### **Training**\n\nWe run regular and intensive training sessions to keep our employees' information security awareness at an adequate level. The awareness efforts are either based on general topics of information security interest, ad hoc demands as timely countermeasures on dedicated use cases, or even target-group-focused topics, and are based on different formats, such as:\n\n- Mandatory e-learning sessions including knowledge check\n- Topic-based videos\n- Classroom training sessions\n- Anti-phishing email campaigns\n- \"My News\" platform to share news via the intranet and internal blog posts\n\n<sup>25</sup> Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\n\n<sup>23</sup> Information Technology (IT) Security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets, such as computers, networks, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of sophisticated hackers.\n\n<sup>24</sup> OT Security is defined as Operational Technology (OT) hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes, and events in the enterprise. OT is common in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), such as a SCADA system.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a door in the center. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Incident Reporting and Escalation Processes**\n\nOMV operates continuous 24/7 security monitoring. Potential findings are processed via Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) intelligence and supplemented by Level 1, 2, and 3 analysts. Escalation procedures exist to ensure timely remediation of security incidents on a 24/7 basis. OMV's Cyber Defense team classifies incidents and triggers the incident response process, then activates all required functions via automatic and manual alerts sent by voice message and SMS. All remediation actions follow predefined \"runbooks\" in order to ensure efficient and timely processing. A clear communication plan ensures the proper information is disseminated to all relevant stakeholders.\n\n#### **Business Continuity/Contingency Plans and Incident Response Procedures**\n\nOMV tests its business continuity plans and incident response procedures annually through cyber emergency exercises. The cyber emergency exercises, which are run with external experts, focus on specific, realistic threat scenarios in order to test related mitigation procedures and processes. The tabletop exercise consists of a series of \"injects.\" Each inject represents an event or a piece of information that is discovered as the scenario unfolds and is related to the security incident at hand. The audience of this scenario usually consists of up to 30 participants, including representatives from the IT Security, superior IT Management, and OT Security teams, among others. After each inject, a corresponding review and evaluation of the process is conducted, including an appraisal determining lessons learned.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n**0** noteworthy cyber security incidents\n\nA holistic cyber security crisis exercise was conducted covering realistic threat scenarios alongside IT and OT areas.\n\nApproximately **65** different types of awareness measures were conducted (e.g., classroom exercises, online training sessions, and email phishing campaigns).\n\nThe **ISO 27000** certification (Information Security Management System) was re-audited and confirmed.\n\nApproximately **400** IT projects were guided by the IT security governance function to ensure defined security requirements are covered, thereby protecting OMV assets according to their protection needs.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nThe OMV Group is dedicated to continuous improvement processes and implementing related measures. The strategic aim is to further increase the IT security maturity level and extend cyber defense capabilities and threat resilience beyond the already established high level. Existing certifications should be renewed or validated in order to ensure external quality checks and assurance. Additional focus remains on the context of the emerging IT and OT areas, especially in light of cyberattacks, to secure critical infrastructure assets and facilities from both functional perspectives.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons inside of circles.

We are aware that the energy transition also brings with it social impacts. OMV is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities and addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\nOur operations impact our employees and the communities where we operate. These impacts can be positive, for example employment opportunities, fostering local businesses, and infrastructure, as well as negative, for example competition for land use, dust production, privacy, and community dependence on the Company, among other things. Our social license to operate is based on upholding human and labor rights and developing positive relationships with our employees and communities.\n\nWe are committed to building and retaining a talented, sustainable expert team of employees for international and integrated growth to meet today's challenges and adapt for tomorrow. OMV is committed to ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees and has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind. We embrace our differences and use our diversity of thought and experience as a catalyst for growth and creativity. With our People & Culture (P&C) Strategy, we are ensuring the transformation of the OMV Group will be a success by adapting our current ways to fit with our new aspirations. Building on our capability, we are reinventing how we lead and our way of working, and growing our network of experts, because \"People make it happen.\" In 2023, we introduced our new OMV Group Values \"We care | We're curious | We progress,\" which will guide us on our path to a more sustainable future. Our values underpin our culture and signal what is important to us. Building a corporate culture based on these values will give us a competitive advantage, enable new and enhanced ways of working, and pave the way to becoming a net zero-company by 2050.\n\nThe People strategic focus area combines our commitments and actions relating to our employees and communities under one umbrella. Our approach begins with ensuring that the human rights of our employees, contractors and communities are upheld – efforts that are described in the \"Human Rights\" material topic. The \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\" \"Employees,\" and \"Communities\" material topics then further outline how we ensure those rights are realized, whether economic, social, or cultural.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

It features the number 16 above the words \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\" in white text on a blue background. Below the text is a white dove holding an olive branch perched on a gavel.\n\nHuman rights are universal values that guide our conduct in every aspect of our activities. The OMV Group strives to be a fair and responsible employer and recognizes its responsibility to respect, fulfill, and support human rights\n\nin all operations. We are committed to addressing any adverse human rights impacts we are involved in and to implementing adequate measures for their prevention, mitigation, and, where appropriate, remediation.\n\nRespect for human rights Employee and social concerns\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nThe OMV Group holds itself responsible for respecting the human rights of our employees, as well as those of people directly impacted by or involved with our business, for example our suppliers and contractors, communities, indigenous peoples, and the society in which we live and operate our business. Our responsibilities in the area of human rights include, and are not limited to, equality and non-discrimination, decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, security, primary health care, labor rights in the supply chain, education, poverty reduction, land rights, and free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). We specifically concentrate on the impact of our activities on the human rights of individuals and groups that are more likely to be in vulnerable situations, such as indigenous peoples, women, and children.\n\n## Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nOur Code of Conduct and the [OMV Group Human Rights](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522232974703/omv-group-human-rights-policy-statement.pdf) [Policy Statement](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522232974703/omv-group-human-rights-policy-statement.pdf), which are both approved by the Executive Board, set out our understanding of and responsibility for respecting and realizing human rights in our business environment. Our Human Rights Policy Statement includes detailed descriptions of our specific human rights commitments, e.g., related to workers' rights, vulnerable groups, and security, as well as our commitment to contributing to a Just Transition.<sup>26</sup> Borealis and OMV Petrom have developed their Human Rights Policy Statements based on the OMV Group's statement, and both have been approved by the CEO and Executive Board respectively.\n\nThe OMV Group respects and supports human rights as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in internationally recognized treaties, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO). OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis have signed the UN Global Compact and are fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. This includes a commitment to upholding labor rights, such as decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, and provisions against forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking. We therefore fully support the aims of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are committed to operating our business and supply chain free from forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. The OMV [Statement on Modern Slavery and](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522204527328/dload_Statement_slavery_trafficking_2020_EN) [Human Trafficking](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522204527328/dload_Statement_slavery_trafficking_2020_EN) explains in detail the countermeasures taken in all parts of the business and supply chain.\n\nIn addition to these commitments to international norms, we have further mapped out our human rights responsibilities in a comprehensive Human Rights Matrix, which is designed to serve as the foundation for our activities in this area. The OMV Group Human Rights Matrix covers responsibilities in the areas detailed below. The management of these commitments is further defined in a number of internal directives and regulations, such as the Community Relations and Community Development handbook available for all CSR focal points within the OMV Group, the Human Rights Management System, and our Community Grievance Procedure.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a thorough revision of our OMV Group Human Rights Management in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as any new or upcoming legal requirements, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and other regulations related to mandatory human rights due diligence. With the revision of the human rights due diligence steps and the reformulation of roles and responsibilities, we aim to improve the integration of human rights into our overall risk management processes and across all functions.\n\nWe have also reviewed in detail our Human Rights Matrix, which forms the heart of the OMV Group Human Rights Management System and describes our concrete human rights responsibilities (for more details, see Human Rights Matrix).\n\n#### **Equality and Non-Discrimination**\n\nThis includes the implementation of appropriate guidelines and awareness raising. Read more about our approach to this topic in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\n#### **Security**\n\nThis includes preventive, defensive, and community-oriented approaches to security, clear guidelines, supervision, and training, all in line with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Read more about our approach to this topic in Corporate Security.\n\n#### **Health and Safety**\n\nThis includes the OMV Group's health and safety management as well as community arrangements. Read more about our approach to this topic in Health, Safety, and Well-Being.\n\n#### **Labor Rights**\n\nThis includes decent living wages, working hours, employee representation, collective bargaining, and provisions against forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking. We support the \"five fundamental principles and rights at work\" outlined in the ILO Declaration. We are committed to respecting workers' rights, in line with ILO's fundamental Conventions on rights at work, and we expect our contractors, suppliers, and the joint ventures we participate in to do the same. Where local labor rights standards fall short of the OMV Group's standards, based on international human rights law, the OMV Group is guided by its higher standards unless this is forbidden by law.\n\n<sup>&</sup>quot;Just Transition\" refers to addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy as stated in the Guidelines of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for a just transition. 26\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nThe OMV Group strives to be a fair and responsible employer. Upholding and promoting labor rights is essential to achieving legal compliance in a local and international environment. It is also essential to ensuring that our global workforce can develop professionally and fulfill their personal aspirations in line with our business needs.\n\n#### **Working Hours and Flexibility**\n\nWe are committed to complying with applicable local working time and overtime payment provisions, which is essential for a professional working environment. Parttime work is offered. In general, our part-time employees are entitled to the same benefits as full-time employees, except where benefits are linked to the amount of time worked (e.g., number of home office days per month, with full-time employees being entitled to more home office days than part-time employees). In line with local legal provisions, we offer further flexible work options such as special part-time work for certain age groups and workfrom-home options that provide greater time flexibility for our staff. We offer various forms of long- and short-term breaks from work such as sabbaticals and parental and other care leave.\n\n#### **Operational Changes and Minimum Notice Periods**\n\nOur personnel policy is based on long-term employment. Both staff and the organization should benefit from long-term working relationships. We are also aware that job security represents a major concern not only for the individual employee, but also for society and the region concerned, and we therefore make every effort to live up to these responsibilities by means of contingency planning. Where business, organizational, or security changes require adaptations in the workplace, or even a termination of employment, we evaluate all the options, engage in constructive dialogue, and respond with the maximum possible care and sensitivity. Almost all of our employees are covered by mandatory notice periods under employment law or collective bargaining agreements in the event of restructuring. In situations where, despite training, transfer, or development programs, staff release becomes unavoidable, we make every effort to consider the economic and social consequences of those affected. We are committed to complying with local legislation regarding minimum notice periods in each country where we operate.\n\n#### **Wages**\n\nWe are committed to locally applicable decent living wage standards. For almost all of our employees, minimum wages or salaries are fixed by law or agreed by way of collective bargaining.\n\n#### **Right to Education**\n\nThis includes employee training and support for basic education in the surrounding communities. Read more about\n\nour approach to this topic in Skills Development and Training and Community Investments.\n\n#### **Property and Standard of Living, Including Land Rights and Poverty Reduction**\n\nWe adhere to international best practices, which require avoiding involuntary resettlement, or at least keeping it to a minimum. Where resettlement is unavoidable, all people affected should be compensated fully and fairly. We are committed to a fair and transparent procedure for land use and compensation to local communities or authorities. If exploration, development, or production activities have the potential to impact communities, and/or their land, we consult with all relevant stakeholders ahead of time and obtain permission to use the land either temporarily or permanently.\n\n#### **Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples**\n\nWe are committed to community consultation based on free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) in accordance with IFC Performance Standard 7 and ILO Convention 169. We are aware of indigenous communities in the proximity of our operations in Māui, Pohokura, and Maari in New Zealand, as well as in the Arma district in Yemen. Read more about our approach to engaging with our communities in Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\n#### **Privacy and Family Life**\n\nThis includes personal data protection and appropriate living and working conditions. An internal data protection directive is in effect for our employees, and we adhere to a public [data protection policy](https://www.omv.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/data-protection) regarding the processing of personal data. The OMV Group is aware that specific circumstances of operations in the field (remote locations away from family, residence in camps, etc.) potentially impact rights to privacy and to family life. Therefore, we apply the principles of necessity and proportionality regarding our employees' living and working conditions.\n\n#### **Environment and Climate Change**\n\nThe OMV Group recognizes the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a human right that is intrinsically linked to a wide range of other human rights. With our OMV Strategy 2030, we are fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition, acting on responsible resources management, and minimizing the environmental impacts of our operations.\n\nCognizant of the social impacts that the energy transition entails, the OMV Group is committed to contributing to a Just Transition for our employees and communities, and to addressing the social and economic effects of the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n#### Governance\n\nIn 2023, we took major steps to entrench accountability for human rights in our Company leadership. The Corporate Human Rights Experts team has been integrated into the Group Sustainability Team, which reports to the CFO. Our CEO continues to be the key owner of the topic of human rights, with the CFO being a co-owner. We continued our biannual human rights briefings with the CEO and CFO. They are both personally briefed about our main achievements and challenges related to our human rights impact at least twice a year (and whenever critical concerns arise). The main topics of discussion during the 2023 briefing sessions included principal achievements, major gaps and next steps of our human rights management approach, human rights compliance in contractor management, human rights grievances, the annual human rights risk ranking, the Human Rights Self-Assessment (HRSA) at Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO), the Community Grievance Mechanism (CGM) Assessment at OMV Tunisia, and our results of the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark. At the end of 2022, the OMV Group renewed its commitment to human rights with the formal approval of our revised OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement by the OMV Executive Board.\n\nBelow Board level, accountability for our compliance with human rights lies with the respective countries' business heads. Locally based human rights focal persons conduct due diligence at the operating facilities with the support of five human rights experts at Group level (at OMV, SapuraOMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis) plus a team of four Social Compliance Experts at Borealis. Action plans and mitigation measures are implemented and reported by the respective functions, depending on which aspect of human rights is in question. Thus, the People & Culture (P&C) department deals with human rights issues related to labor rights, the Procurement department steers the management of human rights issues in supplier relationships, the HSSE department is responsible for health, safety, and security-related human rights issues, and the corporate Community Relations and Development function oversees OMV responsibilities related to the human rights impact on communities and indigenous peoples.\n\n### Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\nThe human rights due diligence process involves assessing the human rights risk associated with our current and future business activities and taking risk management actions. This ongoing process uses external resources and expertise, which includes external stakeholders, particularly those from impacted groups.\n\n#### **Human Rights Matrix**\n\nSince 2008, we have mapped out our human rights responsibilities in a comprehensive Human Rights Matrix designed to serve as the foundation for our activities in this area. We use this tool to assess our human rights challenges and activities, and prioritize our actions as essential, expected, or desirable in defense of human rights. In 2023, we initiated a review of the Human Rights Matrix as a follow-up to our review of the OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement in the previous year. Keeping the overall structure of our Human Rights Matrix, we aim to improve the alignment of its content and language with international human rights due diligence standards and legislation. The updates will reflect the increasing responsibility of companies and better incorporate the most salient issues.\n\nAt all stages of the human rights due diligence process, we use the OMV Group Human Rights Matrix as a common standard, mapping out reality on the ground against the specific responsibilities as defined in the matrix, and identifying any gaps we need to focus on. This approach helps us identify any potential human rights impact of our business activities, whether it relates to non-discrimination and diversity, labor-related issues (e.g., decent living wage standards and adequate break times), indigenous peoples' rights, or human rights in the supply chain.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nThe OMV Group has developed due diligence tools and techniques to assess the risk of human rights violations<sup>27</sup> related to our business, even before we launch or acquire business in a new country. Human rights are one of the components considered when making the decision to engage in a new country. The relevant human rights risks are presented to the respective Executive Board member to factor into the decision on whether or not to enter a country. We use these assessments to derive concrete measures to reduce the risk of direct and indirect involvement in potential human rights violations. We also conduct regular assessments of our current operations to determine their exposure to the risk of human rights and labor rights violations.\n\nDue diligence starts with an initial risk ranking at country level: every country we operate in (or plan to operate in) is assessed based on comprehensive human-rights-related data and in consultation with internal experts. The countries are rated as low, medium, and high risk, countries with the greatest manageable risk, and \"no-go\" countries with unmanageable risk. Based on this rating, we develop our yearly work plan, defining further due diligence actions and human rights training. Internationally recognized third-party experts support the OMV Group in conducting due diligence on the Company's exposure to human rights\n\n<sup>27</sup> A human rights violation happens when OMV fails to respect, fulfill, and support the realization of human rights in relation to our business activities, or becomes complicit in human rights abuse as understood under current international law, and as committed to in our OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement and mapped out in our OMV Human Rights Matrix.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside of circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nrisks in countries with high human rights risks. In 2023, for example, external human rights experts supported our Human Rights Self-Assessment in Libya. We also conducted a country entry check that included assessments of human rights risks related to OMV's potential business activities in the country and proposals on concrete mitigation measures in case of positive entry. Compliance checks of about ten potential suppliers in renewable supply (renewable feedstock, GHG tickets, and renewable products such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) were also carried out. The purpose of these compliance checks is to find out if these suppliers have commitments, systems, and processes in place to comply with OMV's human rights commitments.\n\nWe additionally conduct dedicated country risk assessments regarding labor rights to determine and monitor the legal situation and future development. As well as monitoring relevant labor rights risks, we work closely with employee representatives depending on the type of risk and potential impacts. With our annual initial risk rating, we also identify countries with elevated risks<sup>28</sup> of severe human rights abuse such as forced labor, child labor, or restrictions on the freedom of association. Within our country portfolio, 12 out of 48<sup>29</sup> (25%) countries (e.g., Yemen, Libya, and Brazil) show an elevated risk of child labor. Some 18 out of 48 (38%) countries (e.g., Yemen, Libya, and China) have an elevated risk of forced labor. The freedom of association is generally limited in 14 out of 48 (29%) countries (e.g., UAE, China, and Malaysia). We inform the respective General Managers and Human Rights Focal Persons about the elevated risk levels in their countries and recommend specific mitigation measures, for example human rights training for employees and the integration of the mentioned human rights issues in contractor meetings.\n\n#### **Self-Assessments**\n\nThe Human Rights Self-Assessment is one of the tools we use to evaluate the effectiveness of our human rights due diligence approach. Such assessments create internal awareness, capture our self-perception of our human rights performance, and facilitate the identification of gaps and further actions. Based on the outcomes of these assessments, we offer, support such as further capacity building to local experts or encourage peer and business partner initiatives to tackle local challenges. In 2023, we followed up on our Human Rights Self-Assessment at Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO)30, which we conducted in 2022 with the support of external human rights experts. A detailed report produced by the experts was shared with the PARCO management along with key recommendations, which included:\n\n- Establishing a human rights management system that supports the identification, integration, tracking, and mitigation of human rights risks.\n- Building the capacity of PARCO's team and establishing functions dedicated to implementing human rights due diligence at PARCO.\n- Developing an operational level grievance mechanism that applies to external stakeholders.\n- Reviewing PARCO's policies and clearly committing to promoting equality in all aspects of the company.\n- Applying a human rights lens across processes and practices that focuses on right holders, including vulnerable groups.\n- Including a human rights clause in policies e.g., Code of Conduct & Ethics, Guiding Principles of PARCO. Developing and implementing procedures to address human rights risks in security, land acquisition, community health and safety, and the supply chain.\n- Leveraging CSR initiatives to engage stakeholders on the human rights impacts of operations.\n- Establishing policies that protect employees from reprisals.\n\nWe also conducted a Human Rights Self-Assessment exercise at OMV Libya and a detailed report was provided by the experts, which outlined the following recommendations:\n\n- Increase understanding of human rights risks related to assets, particularly taking into account workers and local communities.\n- Build the capacity of the in-country team and establish functions dedicated to implementing Human Rights Due Diligence and monitoring progress at OMV Libya and associated assets.\n- Explore ways to gain and exercise leverage with operators and the national oil company (NOC) in mitigating identified human rights impacts to the greatest extent possible.\n- Engage with key local stakeholders, including civil society, on human rights impacts and how best to manage them going forward.\n- Explore ways to engage with communities likely to be impacted by activities linked to assets.\n- Ensure follow-up and proper documentation of all OMV efforts for the above.\n\n#### **Training and Awareness Raising**\n\nWe pay special attention to training and raising awareness to bring our human rights commitment to life. We provide training on human rights, which helps equip our employees with an understanding of our human rights\n\n<sup>29</sup> In 2023, Russia was not included in the human rights risk ranking for the OMV Group.\n\n<sup>28</sup> Elevated risk countries are those identified with a risk level of \"high,\" \"greatest manageable,\" or \"no-go\" (out of five levels: low risk, medium risk, high risk, greatest manageable risk, no-go) in our initial risk rating.\n\nPak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) is a joint venture between the government of Pakistan (60%) and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (40%), through its Mubadala Investment Company (MIC). OMV holds a 10% stake via MIC in PARCO. 30\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/1 description: The image contains three circular icons. The first icon contains a printer symbol. The second icon contains a left arrow. The third icon contains a right arrow.\n\nmanagement process and gives them a space to work on concrete operational issues and local challenges. Even though the key concepts of the OMV Group Human Rights Management are the same across all countries in which we operate, the training focal points and discussions vary significantly, ranging from human rights in armed conflict environments and the risk of the OMV Group's complicity to the OMV Group's human rights responsibilities in joint ventures, personal legal liability, and employees' human rights and grievances. In 2023, we launched a Human Rights Learning Path within our OMV Group Sustainability Academy. A total of 170 participants in six instructor-led sessions learned about human rights in general and within the business context, human rights at OMV, human rights of employees (our own as well as those of contractors and suppliers), human rights of external stakeholders, and human rights and security. The provision of additional resources (e.g., links to online webinars and reading materials from renowned external providers, such as ILO, UN, Ipieca, ICRC) allowed colleagues to delve further into specific topics, e.g., diversity and non-discrimination, labor conditions, forced labor, child labor, human trafficking, and other human rights issues.\n\nAll employees are strongly encouraged to complete our interactive e-learning course on human rights, which is part of the training curriculum for all our employees worldwide. In 2023, we promoted our newly launched human rights e-learning course, which guides employees through human rights norms and situations. The course provides a basic understanding of human rights in the business context and provides insight into our specific responsibilities, for example related to diversity and non-discrimination, labor rights of our own and contractors' employees, human rights in security setups, and the rights of our communities, as well as severe human rights violations such as child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. It also provides an insight into our due diligence tools and what to do in the event of observed or alleged human rights abuse. In 2023, Borealis launched a mandatory human rights e-learning course for the entire Borealis workforce in nine languages, covering all relevant human rights aspects and including transparent information and lessons learned related to the PDH Kallo incident in 2022. In addition, the Borealis ethics code of conduct e-learning covers human rights topics including discrimination, harassment, diversity, inclusion, bribery, and corruption. In 2023, 13% of the Borealis workforce<sup>31</sup> completed the human rights e-learning and 88% completed the ethics code of conduct e-learning. In addition, 100% of the Borealis Executive and Supervisory Boards received in-person ethics training covering human rights.\n\nSapuraOMV has continued raising awareness of human rights among its staff. To ensure everyone who works for SapuraOMV is kept up to date, all new staff, including\n\ninterns, are briefed during their induction and are required to complete an online e-learning module on human rights within the first month of their employment. In this module, they are taught the basics and the main principles of human rights, as well as the implications for their own work. A total of 326 employees have completed the onehour human rights e-learning since its launch in 2022.\n\nWe also implement internal awareness-raising campaigns throughout the Group. On the occasion of the UN World Day Against Trafficking in Persons on July 30, 2023, we informed our staff about our policies and activities against human trafficking. During an internal communication initiative, we also explained how everyone can contribute to this in their daily lives by paying attention to the wellbeing of our own and our contractors' and suppliers' workers, and being alert to any complaints or allegations regarding working conditions. A human rights awareness campaign was also conducted on the occasion of the international Human Rights Day in December. All employees Group-wide were informed about our commitment and the Human Rights Learning Path, and were invited to complete the human rights training modules.\n\nIn 2023, we also focused on developing the skills and awareness of our business partners in the context of human rights. Within the Libyan NOC onboarding exchange program, representatives from the NOC and the operating companies participated in a 1.5-hour human rights awareness session. In addition, we developed and implemented an exchange program to further strengthen the human rights skills of PARCO's CSR manager. During a two-week training program, she gained knowledge of corporate responsibilities and reporting concerning human rights and its integration and fulfillment in various corporate functions. The objective was to implement the findings in coordination with the implementation of the recommended actions resulting from the Human Rights Self-Assessment (HRSA) exercise at PARCO. She had individual training sessions with various OMV corporate functions that deal with human rights-related topics, including security, procurement, people and culture, community relations, and development. Additionally, she worked on an assignment to better understand the process behind the development of a human rights policy document for an organization.\n\nRegarding specific labor rights issues, the rights and obligations of our employees are set out in employment contracts. We keep our employees up to date via our various internal channels of communication (e.g., employee intranet, emails, and news feed) in the event of legal changes or new available information. For questions and specific information, we provide local P&C contacts and employee support hotlines.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Employee Representation**\n\nEmployee representation is a valued and long-standing feature in the Company's strategic orientation. Employee representatives are offered information and consultation rights as legally foreseen. A good and constructive working relationship with employee representation is an overall priority and is seen as being in the best interest of the Group and our staff.\n\nGiven the internationality of our Group activities and the various locations where we operate, employee representation at the OMV Group is diverse and depends on the local legal situation and the setup and activities of the local workforce. We cooperate with all official employee representation bodies, and deal responsibly with our staff directly where no employee representation is available.\n\n#### **Grievance Management**\n\nAccording to the UN Guiding Principles, an effective grievance mechanism is a crucial instrument for ensuring compliance with our human rights commitment, and a source of continuous learning for improving Company human rights performance. Particular emphasis is placed on the prevention of human rights violations and the integration of human rights issues into our decision-making processes. This includes registering grievances to ensure a preventive approach.\n\nOur approach to managing community grievances follows the precautionary principle of obtaining local approval of OMV Group operations. This involves identifying and resolving the issues of concern to the local community early on. OMV's localized Community Grievance Mechanism (CGM) procedures stipulate a stringent approach to systematically receiving, documenting, addressing, and resolving grievances in all the countries where we operate. Human rights grievances from community members and suppliers are submitted through the CGM and then analyzed locally and at Group level. For more information about the CGM, see Community Impacts and Grievances.\n\nWe offer our employees various channels for bringing issues, concerns, and grievances to our attention. They include the PetrOmbudsman at OMV Petrom, where employees and management can have confidential, offthe-record, informal discussions and address issues related to the workplace. Moreover, employees can bring forward their concerns in direct dialogue with human rights managers, human resources business partners, and works council members. At Borealis, such concerns can also be raised through the Borealis Ethics Hotline, anonymously and confidentially, with Group Ethics & Compliance, Ethics Ambassadors, and other reporting channels. In the event of legal or other changes (e.g., restructuring and pension issues), we offer interactive\n\ncommunication sessions with employees regarding working conditions. In 2023, internal grievances concerning field rotations and annual leave were raised by seven site employees. All seven cases are closed. At the end of 2023, out of twelve, two grievances had not yet been solved and P&C was still in dialogue with the complainants – in an effort to find a solution acceptable for all stakeholders involved and in line with national law and international human rights standards. The OMV Group's strong human rights management was put to the test in 2022 when we were faced with major human rights violations related to our business activities.\n\nThe OMV Group is always seeking ways to improve and is strongly committed to further strengthening its processes and mitigation measures to prevent any maltreatment and disrespect of workers' human rights in the supply chain.\n\nAt corporate level, we analyzed the HSSE and Procurement directives for contractor management and prepared a detailed checklist for human rights compliance to be used at site level. The human rights e-learning refers specifically to human rights in business relations, and the new OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement details our human rights commitment related to labor rights and business partners in line with business best practice and international standards. There was a dedicated instructor-led session within the Sustainability Academy on the Human Rights Learning Path, focused solely on human rights in contractor and supplier management – 25 participants from various functions at OMV Petrom, Borealis, and OMV learned about the most relevant human rights risks and how to identify and address them. Our Code of Conduct is currently under review. It defines our business partners' human rights responsibilities in more detail, including commitments on conducting human rights due diligence. We use our collaboration with business partners to embed salient human rights in their business practices and increase their awareness of ethical and ecological standards. We expect business partners to also pass these requirements, as applicable, on to their respective business partners, thus ensuring the application of the values and principles of our Code of Conduct, including ethical behavior, throughout our full value chain.\n\nAt local level, individual monitoring initiatives have been continued to ensure our business partners' compliance with human rights. Among these were spot checks and HSSE walks, the inclusion of human rights in service quality meetings and evaluation criteria with our contractors, the confirmation of contractor employees' employment registrations with local labor offices, detailed checks of framework contracts, and intensified promotion of our human rights training options. Furthermore, all business entities developed shortand mid-term plans to intensify human rights management in contractor relations.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nSapuraOMV has followed up on its short- and long-term measures to improve our human rights performance in business relations, covering the topics of contractors'\n\nagreements and work permits, wages, working and break times, working and housing conditions, access to grievance mechanisms, and training.\n\n#### **Update on the Kallo Case**\n\nIn 2022, Borealis was confronted with reports of alleged human trafficking practices conducted by the main contractor IREM and their subcontractor on a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant construction site in Kallo, Belgium. The practices were reported to involve exploitation, inadequate compensation, lack of social security, and poor housing conditions. Belgian media subsequently alleged that Borealis had been informed two months earlier about these large-scale human trafficking practices. Borealis' internal checks have established that in May 2022 a Borealis employee was made aware for the first time of allegations of social malpractice in relation to one IREM worker through a private social media channel, and that this incident had been reported to the Social Inspectorate of Belgium. Since the allegation, Borealis has taken many steps to increase oversight of its Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) construction site in Kallo, Belgium, and advance its organizational set-up both in terms of competence and governance.\n\nBorealis invested in additional capabilities and capacities to reduce the risk of social misconduct and malpractices, such as setting up and implementing a Global Social Compliance Team, with one social compliance manager across the company and three regional social compliance managers. Borealis also implemented regular alignment meetings with the social inspectorate and work authorities in Belgium and Austria.\n\nBorealis also improved its ability to detect and address any misconduct. Awareness for social compliance was substantially increased n and it is now an integral part of the quarterly business review. A social compliance video in 14 languages and \"Speak up\" cards in 27 languages were produced to promote a speak-up culture within the organization, as well as for supplier onboarding with a focus on social compliance. In addition, Borealis has started to pursue to social compliance engagement walks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, and Sweden. In these engagement walks, the external workers are interviewed on social compliance matters while working on our sites. In case of alleged grievances or an increased risk profile, based on a risk evaluation, external audits will be conducted on social compliance matters and in case of concerns, mitigation plans are agreed and closely monitored. The Borealis Ethics Hotline was also opened to external whistleblowers and a process description implemented in the Borealis Management System (BMS), explaining in detail how to handle any such reports.\n\nBorealis has a zero-tolerance policy for social malpractices and misconduct. A management document was implemented in the BMS, stating the company's social compliance ambition, the framework for identifying regulatory and social compliance risks, advice on designing and implementing regulatory and legal compliance processes and controls to mitigate such risks, and how to monitor and report the effectiveness of these controls. Borealis has also implemented stricter access checks at the site gates of its production locations in Austria and Belgium, combined with more frequent and risk-based checks.\n\nBorealis wanted to provide support to workers who were negatively impacted by the Kallo case and has therefore been in contact with the organization mandated by the Belgian authorities to take care of victims of human trafficking in the Flanders region. In August 2022, immediately after the facts of the Kallo case emerged, Borealis offered a donation from the Borealis Social Fund to the organization to ensure that the victims could obtain all the support they needed. The discussions were conducted for several months, and in the end their offer was not accepted.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

It sets out OMV Petrom's understanding of and responsibility for human rights in our business environment. It is OMV Petrom's guiding principle for dealing with human rights issues in all aspects of daily business. It was published on [www.omvpetrom.com](https://www.omvpetrom.com/) and communicated to suppliers and dealers.\n\nThroughout the year, OMV Petrom conducted three \"crossdivision\" audits, which included human rights aspects, for some of its key contractors (i.e., those with contracts for at least two business divisions, whose activities are of high or medium HSSE risk, and who have long-term business activity with OMV Petrom). Topics like minimum age requirements, collective representation, training, and complaint systems were discussed and documentation provided.\n\nIn 2023, 13 human rights audits and assessments were conducted across the OMV Group. The findings of these, both positive and negative, are compiled in reports that are shared with the responsible managers. Our Group human rights experts support local management in developing action plans to address any identified issues or risks and further strengthen the integration of human rights into our business activities and relationships. In regular update meetings we monitor the activities and provide guidance and training to best overcome any challenges in implementing these action plans.\n\nBorealis signed off its Human Rights Policy Statement in October 2023 with formal approval by the CEO. A new Social Compliance team, consisting of a Borealis Social Compliance Manager and three regional Social Compliance Managers, has been recruited and has established and implemented new social compliance processes and procedures to ensure compliant business conduct by Borealis' business partners, particularly relating to the legal and ethical treatment of workers. Borealis has also conducted a human rights assessment at all Borealis locations in Belgium and the Netherlands. The assessment concludes that Borealis staff have a basic awareness of human rights requirements in accordance with applicable law and the Borealis Group's policies related to human rights. Implementation of the human rights e-learning beginning in the fall of 2023 will continue to help raise awareness on human rights in Borealis locations.\n\nIn Malaysia, SapuraOMV continued to close any outstanding issues from the 2022 assessment at Jerun Fabrication Yard, e.g., regarding wages and benefits, to ensure everyone who works for the Jerun Offshore Development project is paid above minimum wage, their PPE is provided, and they know how to access the grievance mechanism. An on-site human rights assessment was conducted at the Asia Supply Base (ASB) in Labuan, covering its own staff and those employed under contract. It focused especially on the areas of wages and benefits, child labor, forced labor, working hours, and break times. SapuraOMV also initiated Human Rights Self-Assessments in Jerun, ASB, and B15. The respective managers were briefed about the questionnaire and the process and completed all questionnaires over the subsequent weeks. The analysis and final report including recommendations are expected in 2024.\n\n#### Outlook\n\nThe OMV Group will take the following actions in the coming years to continue to improve our human rights approach:\n\n- Continue our efforts in 2024, with our ongoing training and an awareness-raising campaign for employees.\n- Finalize and roll out the reviewed Human Rights Management System across the Group and provide training to further enhance internal skills for its implementation and for the strengthened integration of human rights due diligence into existing business processes.\n- We intend to focus on on-site human rights checks, to improve monitoring while at the same time raising awareness of human rights among our own and contractors' staff.\n- We aim to carry out assessments of high-risk nonoperating assets to identify and address the human rights impacts of our business practices.\n- Borealis is seeking certification for Social Compliance Standard SA8000 and will further enhance its social compliance procedures, based on experience gained in 2023.\n\n<sup>32</sup> Thirty grievances in the context of alleged human trafficking practices by the (sub)contractor at the propane dehydrogenation plant construction site in Kallo, Belgium, are related to exploitation, inadequate compensation, lack of social security, and poor housing conditions of workers. However, at the current point in the investigations there is no evidence of forced labor practices as understood under the ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue circular icon with a white house symbol inside.

We will actively remove barriers to provide equitable opportunities for each employee to grow and contribute to the success of our companies. We will build a culture of trust and respect by working together to ensure an inclusive and safe space for everyone to be their whole and authentic self. The OMV Group is therefore expanding its DEI focus to include a broader range of diversity aspects, such as age, nationality, and diversity of ideas. Ultimately, our goal is to encourage and support all forms of diversity in the workforce and create an environment of respect where all employees are valued. This means having an inclusive culture in which the same opportunities and level of psychological safety are in place for all people to feel supported and be successful, regardless of their background (e.g., nationality, gender, age, social, and health).\n\n## Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nAs stated in our Code of Conduct, employees and job applicants will not be discriminated against because of their age, race, faith or religion, skin color, nationality, ethnic origin, political or other beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, or family status. We have also developed a Group-wide People & Culture Ethics Guideline, which gives more details on our clear position regarding non-discrimination in the workplace. In line with this guideline, we aim to provide Group-wide complaint procedures and investigation principles for any misconduct in this regard.\n\nThe principle of equal opportunity is strictly observed in recruitment. Furthermore, to encourage gender diversity, our recruitment policy reflects our commitment to promoting equal opportunities; at least one female candidate is included in the shortlist for each position, where possible. Gender is one of the diversity criteria we use when selecting members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. We encourage equal pay at all career stages, for example by setting standardized entry-level salaries that are reviewed each year in line with the local market situation.\n\n### Governance\n\nResponsibility for the diversity topic is anchored at the highest level, as the achievement of diversity targets forms part of the ESG targets in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) in the Executive Board's remuneration.\n\nThe OMV Group's People & Culture (P&C) department is responsible for implementing the Group's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy. For more information on P&C, see Employees.\n\nA governance team comprising People & Culture, Communications, and sponsors from Board level across the OMV Group was formed in 2022 to work on our DEI strategy and reach the milestones defined in our roadmap. In addition, during DEI workshops, a volunteer team comprising OMV Group employees was formed and onboarded to provide support in achieving our DEI goals. The volunteer team supports our actions by promoting the initiatives within their teams, creating the voice of the DEI community, and increasing visibility.\n\n## Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\nWe have embedded diversity targets into our people processes such as recruitment, talent and succession planning, learning, and leadership development to ensure female talent is identified and women are supported throughout their career. To strengthen our pipeline of diverse leaders, we have introduced the following measures:\n\n- Providing advanced mentoring for women\n- Launching the SHEnergy women's leadership development program\n- Running career aspiration talks across all our divisions in the OMV Group with the goal of giving talented female employees greater visibility and ensuring we better understand their support needs and individual career plans\n- Encouraging leaders to create an inclusive working environment by making it part of our leadership competencies and performance evaluation of leaders\n- Covering unconscious bias in our leadership programs (in its broadest sense, so not only gender but also generational, people with special needs, background, etc.)\n- Offering interview training as part of our new manager training with the goal of teaching behavioral interviewing techniques, such as how to overcome unconscious bias and how to better structure interviews\n- Including internationality in the criteria for assessing candidates when recruiting executives\n\nThe growing diversity of employees (e.g., gender, generations, and internationality) in leadership positions at OMV confirms the effectiveness of the dialogue and activities underway.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

Building on the foundation laid in 2022 with the launch of the Group-wide DEI strategy for 2030, the OMV Group took significant steps to further embed these principles in its corporate culture. The following initiatives were carried out in 2023:\n\n- The OMV Group further strengthened its DEI strategy by establishing a governance framework. The structure includes five volunteer-based workstreams, led by employees across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis. These dedicated workstreams focus on gender, generations, parenting/caregiving, people with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ inclusion, thus ensuring holistic representation. Each of these workstreams has clear targets and their progress is reported to the sponsors (EB members) twice a year. The workstreams are supervised by the People & Culture management and are sponsored by Executive Board (EB) members of OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis.\n- The International Women's Week featured two impactful events under the theme #EmbraceEquity, highlighting the distinction between equality and equity. The week started with a keynote speech by an external guest speaker, delving into the concepts of self-value and its contribution to the company's success. Additionally, a virtual gathering with three EB members was organized, fostering dialogue on Embracing Equity in the Workplace and promoting a fair and inclusive work environment.\n- The new parent program that was launched in 2021 continued to provide essential support to expecting parents within the OMV Group. By offering workshops covering various aspects of parenthood, including parental leave planning and returning to work, this program helped both male and female expecting parents navigate this period with confidence. Moreover, the OMV Group was awarded the \"Family-Friendly Employer\" award, which was presented by the Minister for Women, Integration, Family, and Media, Susanne Raab. This acknowledgment reaffirmed the organization's dedication to promoting work-life balance and accommodating the needs of working parents.\n- We developed a roadmap for people with disabilities. The OMV Group was audited by myAbility, an initiative aimed at evaluating and enhancing workplace accessibility and inclusivity. The audit results were used to create a detailed roadmap for the company. In November, teenagers were welcomed from a special needs school, facilitating a valuable exchange that provided insights into the corporate world while promoting inclusivity. For example, the organization's commitment was further illustrated on December 4, when the OMV Group participated in the International Day of Persons with Disability, hosting a symbolic Purple Light Up event. The panel discussion with external guest speakers focused on the unique perspectives and insights of the world of disability inclusion, shedding light on the possibilities that arise when we embrace diversity in all its forms and what we can do to show our support. Our colleagues from OMV Petrom created a disability brochure that provides a comprehensive introduction to the disability topic that increases the awareness of all our employees. In addition, the Works Council has created a community for colleagues with disabilities and carers of people with a disability to provide practical support and information about benefits and funding options. In doing so, we are fostering awareness, reducing mental barriers toward people with disabilities, and increasing accessibility.\n- With regard to LGBTQI+, the OMV Group promoted allyship and solidarity within the organization during the Ally Week in September. A panel discussion opened by the OMV Group's CFO encouraged open dialogue and understanding among employees, reinforcing the OMV Group's commitment to inclusivity. Community lunches also occurred several times during the year, where members of the community and allies could meet.\n- To enhance communication and knowledge-sharing related to DEI initiatives, the OMV Group created a dedicated DEI SharePoint site. The platform serves as a central hub for employees to access resources, stay informed about ongoing initiatives, and actively participate in fostering an inclusive workplace.\n\n### Outlook\n\nSeveral initiatives that will help achieve the goals set in our People & Culture Strategy 2030 have been planned for 2024. These include:\n\n- Regular reporting on age distribution to identify gaps and foster intergenerational collaboration\n- Implementing DEI in our Transformational Leadership program\n- Fostering the development of female talent with specific development programs such as SHEnergy, organizing career aspiration talks with board members, and celebrating International Women's Day with impactful events\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

In 2024, we will again assess our gender pay gap across the OMV Group.\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/24 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white outline of three people inside.

Below the text is a white icon of an open book next to a pencil. The second icon, on the right, is for Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It displays the number '8' in white above the words 'DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH,' also in white, against a dark red background. Below the text is a white icon depicting a line graph with an upward trend, indicating economic growth.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the OMV Group's Strategy 2030, all Human Resources (HR) functions Group-wide were renamed People & Culture (P&C). The aim of this department is to fully support the OMV Group's Strategy 2030 by prioritizing key aspects that enable us to unlock our organization's full potential. The new name points to the department's aim and purpose and emphasizes that people and culture are central to achieving the targets defined in our strategy.\n\nWe developed a new People & Culture Strategy in 2022, which fully supports the transformation of OMV and is focused around \"People make it happen\". The core of the new People & Culture Strategy is our purpose, i.e., \"Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living.\" We have developed four strategic drivers: Employee Experience, Growing Talent, Organizational Evolution, and New Ways of Working. These are all powered by a solid foundation of Transformational Leadership, driven by our leaders. As such, the statement \"People make it happen\" not only creates the right working environment in which our employees can thrive, but also ensures that they can further develop their skill sets to meet the demands of our dynamic business. The various initiatives connected to the People & Culture Strategy, like the launch of our new OMV Group Values, created a big impact.\n\nBuilding and retaining a talented and skilled team of employees for international and integrated growth is a key factor in the success of the Group's strategy. We are committed to creating an environment in which every employee can learn, grow, connect, and collaborate, as well as live a safe and healthy life. OMV's core commitments to its employees are detailed in the Code of Conduct. These include promoting learning and development and creating an environment where people can develop professionally and\n\nfulfil their personal aspirations in line with our business needs.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe OMV Group's P&C department covers the following topics:\n\n- Talent acquisition\n- People development, including strategic competency development, talent and learning management\n- People relations, comprising payroll and employee administration and employment law and contracts\n- Rewards and global mobility\n- Coordination by People & Culture representatives of the activities of various units and countries in which we operate\n\nThe organizational setup of the local P&C departments in the various countries is aligned with the principles of being fit for purpose, operating as efficiently as possible, and generating the broadest possible synergies. We promote the strategic exchange of talent between OMV and Borealis to offer employees additional job opportunities and support the development of new skill sets.\n\nThe OMV Group P&C leadership team reports directly to the OMV Group Senior Vice President (SVP) of P&C. The VPs of the P&C departments at Borealis and OMV Petrom functionally report to the SVP of P&C of the OMV Group. The SVP reports directly to the CEO.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n### Talent Attraction and Retention\n\nThe OMV Group is committed to building and retaining talent for international growth. Effective succession planning contributes to the management of business continuity risk by ensuring the preservation of human capital – OMV's most valued asset. As described in our Code of Conduct, OMV strives to build long-lasting employment relationships and to employ people from the countries where we operate.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Talent Acquisition**\n\nOur employees are selected exclusively based on their qualifications, suitability, and professional experience. Internally, we focus on job rotation, promotions, and upskilling to tackle challenges (e.g., transitioning to a lowcarbon business) and develop innovative solutions to enhance our workforce. In the OMV Group, we use joint internal job boards to offer a wide range of internal job opportunities to our employees.\n\nExternally, we concentrate on building robust talent pipelines through cooperation with key universities in our locations. In addition, we aim to build a talent pool by providing apprenticeship programs and internships, which are mainly focused on the technical and commercial aspects of our business. For instance, in Romania, approximately 100 students received scholarships to join the Petrochemical School program in 2023. The Petrochemical School is a dual-system program supported by OMV Petrom. The future petrochemists benefit from professional training in the field of petrochemicals and internships at the Petrobrazi refinery. The students receive monthly scholarships of up to RON 700 from OMV Petrom, plus RON 200 from the Romanian government. Upon completion of the three years of vocational education (petrochemical operators' qualification), students will acquire a recognized professional qualification and will have employment opportunities within our Company. The Petrochemical School program is a pilot project with the aim of assuring a constant and sustainable flow of high-quality blue-collar workers.\n\nTo dispel the negative perceptions of the oil, gas, and plastics industries, it is important to proactively inform the public and our target groups (such as current and potential future employees) about the benefits of the products we produce, as well as the sustainability challenges and how we are addressing them. Being visible on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn enables us to show potential candidates the inner workings of the OMV Group, including what it is like to work for our Company and that joining us means being part of a solution for a more sustainable future.\n\n#### **Performance Management and Career Development**\n\nOMV strives to maintain a uniform organizational structure that provides clarity and transparency in relation to responsibilities and the hierarchical classification of positions. We have developed Company-wide career paths that outline the experience and skills required for a position.\n\nOMV has an annual review process in place to support our employees and managers through structured, systematic planning of performance and personal development within the Company. Employees and their managers work together to set performance and development goals, review progress, and evaluate achievements, with employees ultimately being rewarded and recognized annually.\n\n\"Personal Impact x Potential\" is used as an evaluation tool to provide structured feedback in performance reviews and in succession planning. Managers evaluate their employees on personal impact and potential and identify successors for business-critical positions. Based on this, an employee's development plan is created so they can improve the skills needed for their future role.\n\n#### **Rewards**\n\nTo promote and support OMV's strategy optimally, OMV aims to ensure competitive compensation and benefits packages within relevant labor markets in the oil, gas, and chemical industry. Annual remuneration reviews are conducted for this purpose.\n\nOMV continuously monitors market trends and international best practices in order to attract, motivate, and retain the best-qualified talent from around the world. Base salaries are set in accordance with internationally accepted methods for determining market levels of remuneration, and comply with the relevant legal regulations, for example collective agreements. Base salaries are market oriented, fair, and tailored to the position and expertise of the employee. OMV encourages equal pay at all career stages, for instance by setting standardized entry-level salaries that are reviewed each year in line with the local market situation.\n\nOMV strives for long-lasting employment relationships. We ensure the fair and objective evaluation of positions consistently across all divisions and countries by applying a clearly defined methodology and process, validated by external consultants for specific roles. The outcome of the evaluation forms the basis of the remuneration decisions for every employee. The remuneration includes a balanced and transparent mix of fixed and variable monetary and non-monetary components.\n\nAs part of the annual performance review process, Company goals, including the achievement of sustainability goals (e.g.,\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a door in the center.

The second icon contains a left-pointing arrow. The third icon contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\nHSSE, GHG emission reductions, diversity), are cascaded down to employees in the relevant departments and form part of the annual evaluation and subsequent bonus awarded. Individual monetary and non-monetary rewards are granted on top of this for extraordinary achievements.\n\nThe portfolio of benefits is further customized for each of the countries in which OMV operates to meet the needs of the local employees. Depending on local circumstances, additional incentives may include the following: retirement plans, subsidized cafeteria, health centers, kindergartens (childcare facilities), summer kids camp, and anniversary payments.\n\n#### **Leadership Development**\n\nTo ensure the transformation of OMV will be a success, we need to adapt our current methods to fit our new aspirations. By building on our capability, we are reinventing how we lead as well as our way of working. Therefore, linked to our Purpose and Values, we implemented Groupwide Transformational Leadership Competencies (TLCs). Our TLCs define our expectations of our leaders and complete our transformational framework to successfully drive the implementation of our strategy. The four TLCs for all leaders across the Group are \"Lead self,\" \"Grow people,\" \"Drive change,\" and \"Deliver impact.\"\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/7 description: The image shows a graphic with five sections, each representing a different concept. The first section, in blue, features the words \"Lead self\" above a stylized tree. The second section, in red, displays the words \"Grow people\" above a graphic of two hands shaking in the shape of a heart. The third section, in yellow, shows the words \"Drive change\" above a stylized wind turbine. The fourth section, in green, features the words \"Deliver impact\" above a stylized arrow pointing upwards. A continuous line connects all five sections, transitioning in color from blue to red to yellow to green.\n\nThe new TLCs are being integrated into the respective P&C processes, such as leadership assessment and development, our talent programs, talent acquisition, and performance processes.\n\n#### **Talent Retention**\n\nTo keep and retain talent, we have leadership programs in place that are designed to support all employees who take on new management roles as well as current leaders who want to upgrade their basic knowledge of leadership. The OMV Group Leading Ahead program launched last year together with Borealis and OMV Petrom to offer the Group's top talent a broad leadership development journey and a broad career platform. In 2023, the first participants graduated, and nominations continue for the next program runs.\n\nAs part of our ongoing transformation, are committed to ensure that no one is left behind. To facilitate this, we offer low-carbon training solutions and are continuing to expand our efforts to upskill our workforce. The aim is to keep skills up to date, recognizing that existing skills can be transferred to new energy solutions. We also launched the Sustainability Academy, a SharePoint-based platform for all employees, to expand their knowledge on ESG topics. Through initiatives like these, we are fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, empowering our team to thrive in the evolving landscape of sustainable energy solutions.\n\n#### **Employee Engagement**\n\nWe actively involve our employees in our transformation and in key P&C initiatives such as Diversity, Equity, and\n\nInclusion actions, developing our Values and implementing our 2030 Strategy (see actions 2023).\n\nThe Pulse Check is one of our most important tools for measuring the engagement of our employees and it is an essential part of our new People & Culture Strategy relating to Employee Experience. It is also a chance for our employees to have their say and an opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas. The Pulse Check assesses several key indices, including Safety, Innovation, Line Manager, Employee Development, Strategy, Empowerment/Involvement, Well-being, Values, Sustainability, and Culture.\n\nIn 2023, for the first time, we incorporated a question related to Sustainability into the Pulse Check. The statement \"I believe that our organization is committed to sustainability (e.g., reducing its carbon footprint, promoting diversity, protecting human rights)\" received a 70% positive perception rate. Each line manager is tasked with sharing the results and engaging in dialogue with their team and collaboratively identifying actions aimed at enhancing the current work environment to foster a stronger, more united team.\n\nIn the Pulse Check 2023, we achieved a very high response rate of 82% at Group level. Compared to 2022, 5% of employees in the OMV Group (OMV 7%) moved from actively disengaged/passive to moderately/highly engaged, meaning a 5% increase in the overall engagement score for the OMV Group. This positive trend can be seen across both gender groups. Since 2022, key indices have consistently improved in all dimensions, demonstrating the visible positive impact in our focus areas. As we maintain this momentum, our aim is to close gaps to global and industryrelevant benchmarks. Looking ahead to 2024, factoring in the\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The core of the new P&C Strategy is our purpose: \"Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living.\" Four strategic drivers were developed for this strategy: Employee Experience, Growing Talent, Organizational Evolution, and New Ways of Working, supported by Transformational Leadership. Some of the initiatives to support these strategic drivers in 2023 included:\n\n- In May 2023, we launched our new OMV Group Values \"We care | We're curious | We progress.\" Our Values were defined based on the contributions of more than 13,000 employees and leaders from across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis during a series of interactions, including the Pulse Check survey, leadership interviews, mass focus groups, and workshops, where a feedback tool based on artificial intelligence was used.\n- Ahead of the launch of our new Values, more than 120 leaders from across OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis came together to embark on a shared Leadership Experimentation Journey of discovery, to experiment with our new Values, and experience first-hand the power they can have to transform our way of working and overcome daily business challenges. The result was the creation of individual Values Experiments, which leaders could implement in their teams to resolve their challenges. While the Values Experiments were underway, leaders from all three entities, departments, and functions convened in virtual mixed cohorts, discussing their progress, refining their experiments, and sharing their insights and successes across the OMV Group. This collaborative approach allowed leaders to leverage the company's values to overcome challenges and foster growth.\n- In addition to the Leadership Experimentation Journey, each leader was encouraged to organize a town hall meeting on our Values or, depending on the country, prepare a launch in their location accompanied by a team reflection session. During these sessions, leaders shared their personal stories, gathered initial feedback on the company's Values from their team, and engaged in thoughtful discussions about which behavior to strengthen or weaken. These initiatives were designed to bring the Values to life and foster a meaningful dialogue among teams.\n- We implemented a Purpose & Values Playbook as a guiding resource for leaders on their journey to give meaning and significance to the company's purpose and new Values. Moreover, we introduced a Values Activation Toolkit that offers diverse resources for leaders and their teams to continue the dialogue on the Values. This toolkit is designed to help seamlessly integrate our Values into their day-to-day business activities, promoting a meaningful connection and enabling them to create impact.\n- We also launched a Values SharePoint page accessible to all OMV Group employees, providing a platform to explore and share their personal Values Stories. Employees can also create their own Values Posters to visually express what the Values mean to them, fostering a collective understanding and appreciation of our shared Values.\n- In September 2023, we ran our annual Group-wide Pulse Check survey for the second time. Achieving an impressive 82% participation rate, a 12% increase from 2022, reflects the trust our employees place in our leaders to enact and deliver meaningful change. The results showed an increase in all dimensions with visible positive impact in key focus areas, including 69% on the understanding of our new Values. Conclusions and subsequent actions were agreed within business units by year-end and Q1 in 2024 for implementation in 2024.\n- We have introduced a Change Management Toolkit to provide our teams with overall change management guidance and supporting interventions as they navigate various change processes. This toolkit equips our teams with the necessary resources and strategies to effectively navigate and lead organizational transformations, ensuring a smooth and successful transition for our employees and stakeholders.\n- In response to the reorganization that was implemented in January 2023, Team Effectiveness Training has become a critical component.

By promoting an environment of open communication and teamwork, we strive to break down silos and ensure that information flows freely. In order to achieve that, all leaders were asked to conduct Strategy Refresh Sessions within their teams to further explain the OMV Strategy 2030 and encourage dialogue.\n- Our commitment to learning and development continued, as we were able to expand our learning opportunities through initiatives such as LCB training and the Sustainability Academy. Read more about this in the Skills Development and Training chapter.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn line with our new People & Culture Strategy the coming years will see us focus on:\n\n- In 2024, we plan to introduce our new Employer Value Proposition (EVP). This will serve as a statement or framework that outlines what OMV stands for as an employer. It will highlight the unique qualities and benefits that we offer to our employees. Moreover, it will help us attract and engage potential candidates who align with our new purpose and our OMV Group Values, and the opportunities we provide. Essentially, it's a way for us to communicate why our company is a great place to work and why people should consider joining our team.\n- Following the rollout of our leadership competencies in 2023, a transformation leadership program will be offered, reflecting our new Values and enabling leaders to develop their leadership style. For more information please also see the Skills Development and Training section.\n- For all of our employees, we will be assessing what information and skills they need to support the transformation. Together with our network of experts, we plan to develop an interactive Campus that will support our employees in learning more about our purpose, strategy, and values and provide development sessions to help upskill them for the future.\n- To further support our employees in their development, we are starting to develop a competence framework based on Job Families with corresponding core competencies. This will help employees navigate their career and build their competencies through the dif-\n\n### Skills Development and Training\n\nProviding a culture where our employees can learn and continuously improve their knowledge, competencies, and performance to meet our business objectives and to develop necessary skills for the future is extremely important to the OMV Group.\n\nAs part of our P&C Strategy and our ongoing transformation, developing our employees has become top priority. We need to find and integrate employees with a wider range of skills. We need to balance the reskilling of employees to develop new energy solutions with retaining and training employees with the skills necessary to support our legacy business.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Needs Assessment**\n\nTraining is planned and delivered annually in line with our workforce requirements. It is planned by the business units according to business needs.\n\nIn 2023, we assessed specific learning needs. One aim of this was to increase knowledge of our Low Carbon Business in the Energy segment and strengthen the associated skills. We also wanted to expand know-how in our assets relating to operational management and refine awareness of our Sustainability Strategy among employees (see more below).\n\nEach employee identifies their learning needs through a combination of localized training matrices. These assist them in creating development-oriented action plans linked to career paths, competencies, and professional goals. The four key competencies we encourage our employees to further develop are functional and technical skills, business skills related to effective work at the OMV Group, personal skills, and leadership skills.\n\nAll learning activities should be linked to clearly defined learning and development objectives and agreed with line managers. There are different ways to learn: 70% of what we learn is through on-the-job tasks, 20% involves learning from others through coaching or mentoring, and 10% is from courses. Courses are developed and offered whenever a structured foundation for skills and knowledge is needed.\n\n#### **Reskilling and Upskilling Employees**\n\nTo develop our employees' skill sets to meet the demands of our dynamic business and to pave the path to become a net-zero company by 2050, we are focusing on the following key areas:\n\nferent Job Families. Upskilling our leaders on the newly implemented Transformational Leadership Competencies to enable them to drive the implementation of our strategy.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/1 description: The image contains text describing the OMV Group's efforts to boost employee knowledge and skills in sustainability. It mentions that the OMV Group offers a wide selection of online material and regularly adds Learning Journeys to prepare employees for the evolution of their business.\n\n- Specific initiatives to upskill employees in technical areas are being continued, e.g., focusing on transitioning to a low-carbon business.\n- Initiatives to develop managers in our assets of our legacy business to drive operational excellence.\n- With several initiatives in the area of data science (e.g., data camp) and digital development we provide our employees with the opportunity develop practical skills and excel in the rapidly growing field of digitalization.\n\n#### **Types of Training**\n\nOMV provides mandatory training for all employees in areas such as business ethics, cybersecurity, and data protection, as well as mandatory training depending on the job, for instance within HSSE. In addition, we offer a wide range of optional training for all employees, ranging from technical training (e.g., low-carbon initiatives and sales training) to personal skills training such as managing change or effective communication.\n\nWe encourage the use of online resources for training. The expansion of our online learning content enables employees to access more consistent training content and enhances its accessibility for our offices globally. We also highly encourage employees to pursue further education to enhance their various skills.\n\n#### **Evaluation of Training Programs**\n\nTraining processes include structured requests for feedback, which are conducted after training events in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and success of training measures, and to implement improvement measures. In addition, our overall training metrics (participation, costs, training hours, training topics, etc.) are reported in a training dashboard at a global level every quarter.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**20,549** training participants **EUR 12.3 mn** mn spent on training More than **590,000** hours of training in total\n\n- In 2023, there was a focus on mandatory, legally binding, and business-critical courses for selflearning. Several Group-wide e-learning modules were launched, covering topics such as business ethics, human rights, and data and information security. With the rollout of the HSSE Basics e-learning, Life-Saving Rules e-learning, and g-learning for all employees, the HSSE offer was also expanded.\n- In 2023, we updated our leadership programs with our new Values and Transformational Leadership Competencies that were designed to support both those employees who take on new management roles as well as current leaders who want to upgrade their basic knowledge of leadership. For identified talents at executive level, our dedicated Leading Ahead top talent program focusing on enhancing executive leadership skills was continued, as was our program for women in leadership positions.\n- In terms of graduate development, we offered the second tailored graduate program in Fuels & Feedstock and continued with our long-standing Integrated Graduate Development (IGD) Program in the Energy segment.\n- To support the development of future skills, we rolled out a global data science education platform. Its intuitive and user-friendly interface ensures that learners can develop practical skills and excel in the fastgrowing field of data science.\n- The Sustainability Academy was launched and offered our employees an ever-growing selection of curated learning material about sustainability-related topics. This supports our employees in expanding their knowledge on ESG topics and provides them with a foundation that is needed to understand their role in our journey to net zero. Focus topics for 2023 were ESG, Climate Change, Circular Economy, Sustainable Products, and Human Rights.\n- To support the upskilling of technical employees, we offered specific training initiatives, for example training on low-carbon energy, geothermal, decision quality, and data science.\n- With our Personal Skills Summer Challenge, we playfully encouraged our employees to continue developing their personal skills. At team level, we had a strong increase in team effectiveness training, which supported leaders and their teams in managing the transformation phase.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nVarious ongoing projects started in 2023 will be ready for launch in the course of 2024. This will positively impact the overall user journey for learners, not only by expanding the content of the learning offer (rollout of specific learning\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The Sustainability Academy will continue to grow in 2024 with additional Learning Paths and focus topics.\n- To help our leaders develop their leadership style so they can inspire, support, and empower others to thrive through continuous change and deliver our strategy, we will be launching the Transformational Leadership Program. Over the next three years, we want to equip our leaders with the necessary mindset, knowledge, and skills to lead with purpose and transform our company.\n- To enable our employees to support the transformation, we plan to develop an interactive Campus. We will offer an engaging collection of learning material including e-learning modules, keynote lectures, microlearning, and other learning offers that leverage the expertise and knowledge of our network of experts.\n\nThrough initiatives like these, we are fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, empowering our teams to thrive in the evolving landscape of sustainable energy solutions.\n\n| Target 2030        | Increase average number of annual learning hours to at least 30 hours per employee |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Status 2023        | Average number of annual learning hours: 30                                        |\n| Most relevant SDGs | Image: SDG 4    Image: SDG 8                                                       |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**4.4** By 2030, substantially increase the number of young people and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship\n\n**8.2** Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation, including through a focus on high value added and labor-intensive sectors\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Underneath the text is a white silhouette of a family, including an elderly person, parents, and children. The second icon, in the center, is maroon and displays the number 8 at the top left, followed by the words \"DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.\" Below the text is a white graphic of a line graph with an upward-pointing arrow. The third icon, on the right, is blue and features the number 16 at the top left, followed by the words \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS.\" Below the text is a white graphic of a dove holding an olive branch above a gavel.\n\nFor OMV, transparency, trust, and partnership-based relationships with local communities are key to ensuring we are a responsible and welcomed neighbor wherever we operate. Adding value to the communities where we operate is essential for safeguarding our operations for the future. In the interest of being a responsible international company, we contribute positively to the fulfillment of human rights in our immediate surroundings through a number of projects and initiatives. Investments in community relations and development respond specifically to identified community needs. They are designed to mitigate social risks that could result from company operations and initiate positive change in neighboring communities.\n\nOur commitments to our communities are laid out in our Human Rights Policy Statement. Our Sustainability Directive documents processes and accountability internally, and covers social responsibility, which comprises community relations, development and social investments, human rights, volunteering, and NGO relations for the OMV Group. A special Community Relations and Development handbook is available for all of the OMV Group's community relations managers.\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Community Relations and Development function within Group Sustainability governs and steers community relations at Group level and implements development activities in the countries in which we operate. It also receives regular reporting and feedback from social responsibility teams and local teams, and monitors and ensures adherence to the Group's guidelines on community relations and development. We hold regular structured alignment meetings with our local community relations managers to monitor and steer local implementation of our site-specific global community relations and development commitments. We also organize regular exchanges between all countries in order to share challenges and best-practice experiences as a supplement to the guidance provided. According to our Sustainability Directive, each business area and all subsidiaries can act as initiators of community development investments and social investments within the framework of the OMV Group's Sustainability Strategy processes.\n\nSteering ensures that the OMV Executive Board is informed in an adequate and timely manner about the entire community and social investments portfolio, plans, and performance KPIs. For example, the Group's community relations managers submitted the total budget for community and social investments in 2023 and provided information on the major social or community investments planned.\n\n#### **Borealis Social Fund**\n\nIn 2008, Borealis launched the Borealis Social Fund. Each year, a portion of Borealis net profit is donated to the Fund, based on clearly defined allocation rules. Any external or internal stakeholder can submit a project proposal to the Borealis Sustainability Team, which then validates the proposal and makes recommendations to the CEO, who has responsibility for the Fund and selects and approves all projects. Sponsorship above EUR 0.5 mn per project per year also needs the approval of the Chairman or Deputy Chairperson of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **OMV Petrom Foundation**\n\nLaunched in 2022, the OMV Petrom Foundation develops programs that support long-term investments in disadvantaged communities in Romania in three key areas: health, education, and environment. The Foundation provides resources and solutions and builds strategic longterm partnerships with other non-governmental organizations and central or local public authorities, with the aim of reducing infant mortality, supporting early education, and promoting biodiversity. Through the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom extends its support to early health and education and environmental initiatives that are highlighted in the Social Investment chapter.\n\n#### Community Impacts and Grievances\n\nWe acknowledge that the presence of OMV's business has direct and indirect impacts on local communities. We aim to steer the impacts of our business activities in a positive direction by building and maintaining mutual trust and pursuing respectful community relations, investing in local development, safeguarding human rights, and ensuring that the local suppliers who work with OMV follow sustainable practices. Transparent and prompt communication with local communities that ensures their voices and concerns are heard and addressed helps OMV establish good relations with those impacted by our business operations and supports us in creating a conducive operating environment for the business.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Community Consultation and Social Impact Assessments**\n\nOur community relations and development management process is based on centralized policies and targets, and is implemented by locally responsible persons using local resources. In line with our community relations and development procedure, which is in effect for all countries in which we are active, we engage with local communities through tailored programs. For instance, all projects from OMV's Energy segment require community consultation in the development phase. In 2023, 5 out of 13 development projects were in the process of community consultation.\n\nWe start by conducting a Social Impact Assessment (SIA), which includes the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of local stakeholders. Sometimes, an SIA is integrated into an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to foster synergies and efficiencies. The purpose of an SIA is to ensure that the views of the local communities, especially of indigenous peoples, are incorporated into and addressed throughout all phases of the project life cycle: commissioning, operation, and decommissioning or abandonment. We also pay particular attention to any possible impact on human rights.\n\nBased on the internal guidelines for conducting SIAs, we include a baseline study, community needs assessments, stakeholder analyses, and a study of social risks associated with the project. Where possible, SIAs are conducted in a participatory manner by directly consulting with potentially affected communities. Our standards require the outcomes of the SIA to be communicated to affected stakeholders. Based on the outcome of the SIA, site-specific strategies for community relations and development, stakeholder engagement plans, and Community Grievance Mechanisms are developed and implemented.\n\n#### **Community Engagement**\n\nWe maintain regular communication with the communities that live where we operate and strive to inform them in advance of any planned business activities that may affect them. For example, in the vicinity of our refineries, stakeholders such as local authorities and neighbors are proactively informed in advance of any work that may cause a disturbance (e.g., noise from turnarounds) by way of stakeholder meetings, social media, leaflets, and other channels as appropriate. An example of this in action is the \"green phone\" at the Schwechat refinery, which has ensured 24/7 direct contact for all neighbors for several years now. Every call is answered by the shift supervisor in charge, and in cases of perceived noises or odors, the shift supervisor checks immediately for potential sources in the refinery so that the issue can be resolved as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen plants are decommissioned or we exit a location, our community relations team ensures that potential social impacts are addressed by drawing up targeted community engagement plans, social impact assessment and management plans, and exit strategies for ongoing community development projects.\n\n#### **Community Grievance Mechanisms**\n\nOur approach to managing community grievances follows the precautionary principle of obtaining local approval of OMV operations. This involves identifying and resolving the issues of concern to the local community early on. We strive to conduct our operations in a way that reduces any disruption to our neighboring communities to a minimum; however, grievances can still arise. We manage these grievances through localized Community Grievance Mechanisms (CGMs). The CGMs help OMV and those potentially impacted by its operations resolve issues in a non-judicial manner and, depending on the case, offer access to a solution.\n\nThe CGMs are fully operational in all operated E&P assets, in all three OMV refineries (Schwechat in Austria, Burghausen in Germany, and Petrobrazi in Romania), and at one power plant (Brazi in Romania). A Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM) is in place at SapuraOMV.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nhas a hotline system where grievances can be reported by both internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAt OMV, a CGM is a key tool for preventing and managing our potential impacts on local communities and any associated social risks. Our management of community grievances aims to be fully aligned with the Ipieca best practice guidelines and with the Effectiveness Criteria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Effectiveness Criteria require a grievance mechanism to be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, a source of continuous learning, and based on engagement and dialogue. OMV has set a target to assess the CGMs at all sites against the UN Effectiveness Criteria for Non-Judicial Grievance Mechanisms by 2025. The CGM assessments review the existing processes and practices in place, and identify practical improvement measures. During these assessments, internal and external stakeholders are consulted, including via interviews, on the current performance of CGMs and design improvements that may be necessary. The main findings (e.g., key strengths, improvement areas, and proposed actions) are included in the CGM Assessment Report. The action plans are implemented by local management and monitored by the Group Community Relations and Development function.\n\nCGM assessments have so far been completed in OMV's Energy segment in Austria, Romania, Tunisia, New Zealand, and Malaysia, as well as at the Schwechat, Burghausen and the Petrobrazi refineries. Follow-up actions are currently being implemented in accordance with the findings. The sites already assessed account for 93% of all registered grievances at OMV in 2023.\n\nThe CGMs stipulate a stringent approach to systematically receiving, investigating, documenting, addressing, and resolving grievances in all the countries where we operate in a timely, fair, and consistent manner, thereby laying the foundation for our social license to operate. We define a grievance as an expression of dissatisfaction stemming from a real or perceived impact of the Company's business activities. Grievances can be communicated verbally or in writing and can also be expressed in local languages. They can be lodged by email, phone, through our community relations staff working locally and other locally dedicated channels, as well as at a corporate level. The grievances can be expressed anonymously, as well as on behalf of another individual. OMV does not seek retaliation against any community members who lodge a grievance.\n\nOur grievance management system is based on dialogue with our stakeholders first and foremost and is designed to prevent any risk of retaliation. The CGMs help OMV and those potentially impacted by its operations resolve issues without resorting to the legal system. However, OMV's CGMs do not hinder or prevent affected stakeholders, including\n\nlocal communities, from accessing judicial solutions or other remedies for their complaints or grievances. What they do offer is a channel for resolving grievances out of court and, depending on the case, a remedy for community members. For more information on our community grievance mechanism process, see the [OMV website](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/our-approach/ethical-principles/community-grievance-mechanism-process).\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**732** total external grievances in 2023:\n\n**475** grievances related to our impact on society<sup>44</sup> received (413 resolved45)\n\n**238** grievances concerning an impact on the environment<sup>46</sup> received (178 resolved)\n\n**19** human rights grievances<sup>47</sup> received from externals (19 resolved)\n\nIn 2023, the following key improvements were made to our community relations approach:\n\n- OMV Tunisia completed its CGM Assessment against the UN Effectiveness Criteria. The assessment was conducted to evaluate how OMV Tunisia is implementing the CGM. It highlighted strengths, identified issues and risks, and spotted areas for improvement. Among the key strengths identified was the fact that the mechanism is fully functioning in a highly complex environment and consistently being used to receive and resolve grievances, including legacy grievances, and there is continuous engagement and dialogue with claimants. Recommendations to improve the CGM, such as further improving accessibility, transparency, and documentation, were determined and an action plan was developed and is currently being implemented.\n- The majority of grievances received through OMV's CGMs were registered in OMV Petrom's E&P division. In 2023, we conducted several evaluations and analyses focusing on managing recurrent grievances, especially regarding historically polluted sites. We are working to resolve issues related to the root causes of recurring grievances, such as handling claims related to land rentals and environmental compensation more efficiently. Our proactive efforts to resolve the grievances resulted in a decrease in the number of registered complaints at OMV Petrom E&P of 8% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n<sup>44</sup> Society category grievances include noise, dust, land acquisition, access to project benefits, or other disturbances relating to OMV activities.\n\n- <sup>46</sup> Environment category grievances include land degradation, water pollution, air pollution, etc.\n- <sup>47</sup> Human rights category grievances include just and favorable working conditions at contractors, child and forced labor, indigenous rights, etc. For more information, see Human Rights.\n\n<sup>45</sup> A grievance is considered \"resolved\" when the proposed resolution by the Company is accepted by the complainant. It remains categorized as \"addressed\" if the proposed resolution is not accepted by the complainant.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n- The Petrobrazi refinery has a 24/7 call center service that facilitates communication between the Petrobrazi refinery and all stakeholders wanting to submit complaints or request information. In 2023, the call center was promoted online in the Prahova community. The call center's workflow was also reviewed and the procedure was updated to improve the process.\n- In the first years of the implementation of the Community Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs) in Malaysia, a key finding was that contractors need to frequently be reminded about the availability of the mechanism due to high turnover. In 2023, posters on the availability of the CFM and how to access it were put up in all site offices in several languages.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nWe will take the following actions in the coming years to continue to improve our community relations approach:\n\nOMV Petrom will begin a social and human rights impact assessment (SHIA) for the Neptun Deep project. The Neptun Deep project is the largest natural gas project in the Romanian Black Sea, located about 160 km away from the shoreline in Constanța. The goal of the SHIA is to establish a community baseline study and analysis of the current and potential social and human rights issues affecting the communities near Tuzla and Costinești, and prepare a community engagement strategy, community investment plan, and human rights risk management and due diligence plans in the area.\n\n- At the Petrobrazi refinery, the new working procedure for the call center will be implemented and the call center will continue to be promoted.\n- In OMV Petrom's E&P segment, we intend to continue to investigate root causes and expand on the site investigation and evaluation studies for each historical and recurrent grievance. We will enhance data linkages and management between the Land Management System database and ServiceNow (which houses the grievance management database dedicated to tracking and managing grievances, including the details of the grievances, their status, resolutions, communication records, and any other relevant information related to handling complaints and issues).\n- SapuraOMV will carry out stakeholder engagement activities with fishing communities in the vicinity of its operations and proactively inform them about the availability of the Community Feedback Mechanism.\n\nImage /page/130/Figure/10 description: The image shows information about a target, its status, and the most relevant Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The target for 2025 is to assess the Community Grievance Mechanism at all sites against UN Effectiveness Criteria. The status in 2023 is that 8 out of 9 sites in scope have been assessed. The most relevant SDG is SDG 16, which focuses on peace, justice, and strong institutions. The image also mentions SDG target 16.6, which aims to develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels.\n\n**16.6** Develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels\n\n**16.7** Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making at all levels\n\nNine defined assets on a 100% operator/majority-owned basis from the OMV Energy, Refining, and Power business segments are currently in scope (scope liable to change based on operatorship/divestments).

These include any activities that encompass monetary or non-monetary support and activities beyond core business that aim to contribute to the social welfare and progress of society in general. Our social investments (includes community development projects) aim to create long-term societal value for local communities impacted\n\nby our business and add value to the societies in which we operate.\n\nOur community relations processes and projects help us develop mutual trust and respect between OMV and nearby communities, thus helping us maintain our social license to operate and create win-win situations for all.\n\nImage /page/131/Figure/7 description: The image contains two pie charts showing 2023 investments by main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and by beneficiaries. The left pie chart shows the investments in EUR 45.2 mn, with the following percentages: SDG 17 (55.7%), SDG 3 (11%), SDG 4 (10.4%), SDG 11 (8.7%), SDG 13 (8.5%), SDG 14 (3.2%), SDG 16 (0.4%), SDG 7 (0.4%), SDG 8 (0.1%), and Others (1.8%) which include SDGs 10, 1, 9, 6, 15, 2, 5, and 12. The right pie chart shows the investments in 1 mn beneficiaries, with the following percentages: SDG 3 (17.1%), SDG 4 (16.5%), SDG 1 (10.3%), SDG 17 (12.8%), SDG 14 (37.4%), SDG 13 (1.3%), SDG 7 (0.1%), SDG 11 (0.3%), and Others (4.1%) which include SDGs 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12. The image also includes a legend for the SDGs.\n\n#### **2023 Investments by Main SDGs and by Beneficiaries**\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Needs Assessments**\n\nCommunity development investments are always aligned with identified local needs and made following consultation with local stakeholders, as well as following consideration of country-specific priorities in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We prioritize projects with the potential for generating long-term societal value and making a lasting change to beneficiaries' lives. Community and social investments are aligned with the SDGs and the community needs identified during Social Impact Assessments (SIAs), or with broader societal priorities (e.g., by consulting the Social Progress Index49).\n\nWe aim to implement our projects in partnership with locally active stakeholders or non-governmental organizations to ensure a maximum social return on our investment. We implement our community development projects as investments, and thus expect each project to generate a return for our communities, or society more\n\nbroadly. These initiatives often also include knowledge transfer initiatives aimed at building the local technical capacity of potential workforce or supply chain partners.\n\n#### **Prioritization**\n\nConsistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and supports OMV's social responsibility objectives. OMV has therefore defined three key focus areas for our community and social investments:\n\n- Access to basic services:\n- Education, entrepreneurship, and employment:\n- Climate action and circular resource management:\n\nIn addition to the priorities defined by the Group, individual countries or subsidiaries also identify priorities that are specific to them. For instance, the Borealis Social Fund\n\nThe Social Progress Index, developed by the Social Progress Imperative, is a comprehensive measure of real quality of life, independent of economic indicators across countries. More details can be found at: [www.socialprogress.org](https://www.socialprogress.org/) 49\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nhas defined three areas of social engagement that contribute to SDGs 14, 6, 7, and 4.\n\n#### **Corporate Volunteering**\n\nOMV Group employees are encouraged to personally play an active part in sustainability initiatives, including through volunteering. We offer OMV employees the opportunity to actively engage in encouraging responsible and sustainable behavior and facilitate employee involvement with charitable partners. Group-wide volunteering activities in line with specific targets are part of our community and social investments.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a volunteering action of 18 participants with the Tafel Austria organization, which currently saves up to four tons of food from being destroyed every day and supplies it to around 28,000 people affected by poverty. OMV has been supporting Tafel Austria at various levels for many years. The aim of the cooperation with Tafel Austria is to raise awareness of the issue of poverty and food waste both among our colleagues in the company and in society, and also to provide a better life for people in Austria who are affected by poverty.\n\nWe also continued our tree planting activities in Romania and New Zealand. Over the course of the four-year Romania Plants for Tomorrow campaign, 22,000 volunteers contributed to the planting of 2.8 mn seedlings over an area of 550 hectares. As part of New Zealand's Project Crimson, almost 70,000 native plants have been planted since 2020 and 11 volunteers participated in 2023.\n\nEvery year, tons of rubbish float ashore along the coast of Stavanger and along the entire coast of Norway. Clean Shores is a global non-profit organization that works to keep the world's coastlines clean and free of litter. OMV (Norge) AS is the main sponsor of Clean Shores Global and through this, we support the local community, act as good neighbors, and show that we care. In turn, OMV highlights Clean Shores Global as a partner in its Corporate Social Responsibility profile, and encourages employees of OMV (Norge) AS to participate in volunteer beach cleaning operations. These are organized spontaneously by groups of employees or departments. Around five to ten cleaning sessions take place each year with five to ten participants on average.\n\n#### **Environment Days at OMV Tunisia**\n\nAs part of an international campaign to #BeatPlasticPollution, around 100 employees from OMV Tunisia spent two days volunteering to collect plastic waste either on the beach of Gabès or in the desert of Tataouine. To celebrate World Environment Day (WED), which takes place annually on June 5, 25 people from corporate volunteering, including members of the OMV Tunisia leadership team,\n\nwere present at the beach in Gabès to participate in the \"Run and Plog\" activities jointly organized by OMV and other public sector institutions and local non-government organizations. Participants engaged in a plastic waste collection rally. The Gabès coastline is home to a vulnerable ecosystem in the Mediterranean with increased interest in preserving marine biodiversity (e.g., endangered turtle species). From Gabès, we moved to our sites in the desert of Tataouine. Another cleaning campaign was held in the heart of the desert, where the Waha CPF and Nawara CPF field teams and contractors gathered to pick up littered plastic. Two permanent waste containers were also placed on the road to allow travelers to dispose of plastic bottles in an adequate way.\n\n#### **5,000 Therapy Minutes Donated by OMV Employees**\n\nWe also consider OMV employees' participation in fundraising campaigns as part of our volunteer work. During the CAPE 10 Christmas campaign, OMV employees supported the CAPE 10 Foundation in financing urgently needed therapy hours, especially psychotherapy, for children and young people in Austria in 2024. The donated sum of EUR 4,260 was doubled by OMV and four children and young people at risk of poverty will be able to receive the therapy they need in 2024.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nEUR **45.2** mn in community and social investments<sup>50</sup>\n\n**293** community and social investments in 24 countries\n\n**1** mn beneficiaries reached\n\n**2,471** employee volunteers\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Access to Basic Services**\n\nIn 2023, we continued our plans to invest in infrastructure to improve access to basic services such as health care and water. Our investments have focused on supporting underserved communities or areas with limited access to basic services in countries where we operate, in line with our commitment to respecting human rights. Nevertheless, unforeseen events and disasters can happen at any time. OMV responds immediately to acute problems, e.g., disaster or humanitarian aid, and consistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and support of OMV's social responsibility objectives.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\n#### **Humanitarian Aid**\n\nIn 2023, the Borealis Social Fund partnered with the Austrian Red Cross to launch the Borealis Immediate Aid Fund (Borealis ISH Fonds) to provide fast and unbureaucratic financial aid to help people in Austria in financial emergencies. Based on a needs analysis, the fund focuses on helping young families and elderly people in emergency situations where no other support is available. In addition to receiving financial aid, recipients benefit from a consultation with the Austrian Red Cross to help them avoid similar situations in the future.\n\n#### **Victims of the Earthquake in Turkey and Syria**\n\nThe devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria in 2023 was impossible to ignore or forget. The OMV Group put several immediate measures in place and committed to providing substantial support for the Austrian national rescue and emergency teams on the ground in the amount of EUR 0.5 mn.\n\nThe Borealis Social Fund supported those affected by the Turkey and Syria earthquake by contributing to a container city in Adana, Turkey, which was set up temporarily to house families while the area was being rebuilt. Borealis contributed to 34 out of 200 containers and this aided 152 people.\n\n#### **OMV's Response to Catastrophic Flooding in Libya**\n\nHeavy rainfall caused by Storm Daniel resulted in severe flooding in several areas in eastern Libya in September 2023. The worst affected was Derna, where a part of the Wadi Derna dam was washed away and large sections of the city were rendered uninhabitable by the floods. Two dams upstream of the city burst one after the other, releasing huge volumes of water that rushed down the valley and flooded the area, destroying roads, bridges, and buildings and killing thousands of people.\n\nOMV's employees and assets in Libya were not affected. OMV Libya was actively involved with the NOC (National Oil Corporation) Emergency Management Committee, and together with other international companies operating in Libya, immediately offered support to meet the urgent humanitarian needs in the eastern region of Libya. OMV demonstrated one of the fastest responses to this devastating event by delivering two urgently needed 1 MW generator sets to support the affected areas within three days.\n\n#### **Together from Day One, Romania**\n\nThrough the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom extended its support for early health initiatives. Under the Together from the First Day program, OMV Petrom invested EUR 1 mn to equip 45 maternity wards and neonatal units in 28 counties. This resulted in improved\n\nneonatal care for over 20,000 newborns, contributing to a reduction in infant mortality. Furthermore, the First Step to Health project aimed to equip 39 family practitioners' offices to improve prenatal care by providing essential support for 7,000 pregnant women and young children. Finally, the Baby Box program received financing of EUR 1.58 mn to provide vital assistance and health information to 2,713 mothers and newborns in vulnerable circumstances. More Information can be found on the [OMV](https://www.omvpetrom.com/en/sustainability/omv-petrom-foundation) [Petrom website.](https://www.omvpetrom.com/en/sustainability/omv-petrom-foundation)\n\n#### **WISE Charitable Trust for Healthy Homes in Taranaki, New Zealand**\n\nSupport for the WISE insulation program for healthy homes enabled 264 homes in the Taranaki region to be insulated in 2023. Through OMV New Zealand's support of the Bellyful program, 1,942 meals were provided to 269 mothers with young babies in need.\n\n#### **Water and Energy: Water for the World Program**\n\nAccess to water and energy are fundamental as they affect the ability of poor families to obtain sufficient food and protect their health, as well as limiting the livelihoods and educational opportunities available to them. Since 2007, Borealis and Borouge have provided solutions through Water for the World, a joint program to address the global water and energy challenge in rural and urban communities, with a focus on South-East Asia and Africa. The program cooperates with a range of non-profit organizations and supports numerous projects across Asia and Africa, including in China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nepal, Morocco, Myanmar, and Pakistan, benefiting over one million people since its inception.\n\nWater for the World celebrated its 15-year anniversary in 2023. Based on a joint vision and global concept, the two companies followed different local implementation strategies tailored to the companies' organization and local needs. The two approaches complement each other: With activities in Asia and the Middle East and in regions with water scarcity or the need to extend water infrastructure to remote regions, Borouge implemented a variety of projects in a number of countries in that region, each with a respective local/national NGO and supported by the respective Borealis employee in charge of Borouge's activities in that country.\n\nWith the majority of its activities in Europe where the challenge is mostly related to old infrastructure leading to water leaks, Borealis focused on supporting awareness raising, for example through water roadshows/exhibitions and supporting the Stockholm Water Prize, improving knowledge on topics such as preventing water leaks caused by aging water infrastructure, efficient water use in agriculture/sustainable water practices in agriculture, and\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/134/Picture/0 description: The image contains the text \"OMV SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 / FOCUS AREAS\".

The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\ncalculating the world's first water footprint for plastics. In addition, since 2007, Borealis has worked in partnership with Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor to provide funding and in-kind materials to support their activities on the African continent.\n\nThe program was expanded in 2017, and in addition to water infrastructure, renewable infrastructure projects were also implemented. The first project was launched in Myanmar with the installation of photovoltaic modules in a hospital in Kanni, which was followed by a project in Uganda.\n\nOver the last 15 years, the water challenges faced by the world have changed and today include the consequences of climate change, such as increased natural disasters, floods, and droughts. Therefore, during 2024, the program will be reviewed and the conceptual approach and project portfolio adapted to meet the societal needs of today and the future.\n\n#### **Status 2023**\n\nSince it began in 2007, Water for the World has reached more than 1 mn people and implemented over 20 projects in more than 20 countries.\n\nImage /page/134/Figure/8 description: This image is a timeline titled \"Water for the World Highlights\". The timeline starts in 2007 with the launch in Dusseldorf at the 2007 K-Fair. In 2008, there was a launch in Abu Dhabi and at the Singapore International Water Week. In 2008-2009, there was a Troubled Water Exhibition touring across all Borealis locations. In 2009, they were recognized by the TRIGOS AWARD, the Austrian Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Award. In 2012, 5 Years Water for the World 300,000 people reached. In 2014, they reached 50,000 people in Nairobi, Kenya, through a W4W project in collaboration with OFID and WSUP\\*. In 2017, 10 Years Water for the World 800,000 people reached. In 2019, there was expansion towards renewable energy. First projects in Myanmar and Malawi. In 2023, 15 Years Water for the World over 1 million people reached.\n\nWSUP: Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor; OFID: OPEC Fund\n\nAdditional projects contributing to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 can be found on the [OMV website.](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility/community-projects-initiatives)\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Education, Entrepreneurship, Inclusion, and Employment**\n\nIn 2023, we continued to develop community projects that promote self-sufficiency, job growth, and economic development within communities impacted by our business operations. Education, entrepreneurship, and employment are key factors in socioeconomic development and positively contribute to numerous other SDGs. OMV has been involved in community and social investments focused on education, entrepreneurship, and employment for many years now. We invest in vocational training, microlending, scholarships, and building supplier capacity. Some of the key initiatives that the OMV Group has been actively involved in include:\n\n#### **Tasharok: Empowering Communities in Tunisia**\n\nOMV Tunisia completed the Tasharok project in Gabès, which was celebrated with the community in the presence of regional officials and OMV partners. The aim of this project was to bring about a positive change in Basboussa and Bouchemma, two communities in the vicinity of the Nawara Gas Treatment Plant (GTP), by: enhancing the city's waste management services in collaboration with the municipality, and equipping it with the necessary materials and equipment; collaborating with a local micro-grant program for the benefit of Basboussa community members so they can create small-scale economic activities to improve their financial situation and support their families; and bringing people together to organize and support each other in resolving community issues through the creation of a community-based organization, and acting as a representative for the Basboussa neighborhood.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nSouthlabs is a start-up support initiative aiming to drive innovation in south Tunisia, namely Tataouine and Gabès. Twenty beneficiaries from both regions have been selected to benefit from a coaching program that allows them to apply for the start-up initiative run by the state. The program provides business plan improvement, communication, marketing, and fundraising training. Having applied for and received the start-up label, beneficiaries will benefit from early-stage funding of up to EUR 100,000.\n\n#### **Early Childhood Education and Care in Romania**\n\nIn Romania, the participation rate in early education has decreased in recent years and is among the lowest in Europe. Through the OMV Petrom Foundation, OMV Petrom has been able to support early education projects. The Start in Education project targets 60,000 preschool children (age 3–6) from underprivileged communities, with the aim of enhancing their school readiness. The educational project addresses the immediate needs of the most vulnerable preschool children, mostly from rural areas, and aims to facilitate their access to educational resources, with early learning experiences managed by parents at home. This has resulted in increased enrolment in the kindergarten.\n\nIn the 2023–2024 school year, ABC Kindergarten teaching kits will continue to be provided for 1,500 kindergartens, and training programs in the field of interactive education and parenting will be organized for 3,500 educators. The project will also support another 60,000 preschool children and 10,000 parents in 41 counties with educational resources and parenting workshops. Thanks to this, the number of children benefiting from the Future in a Schoolbag educational kit has reached 120,000, and the number of parents participating in the School of Parents workshop reached 23,000. Also, the \"Let's be friends – no bullying in kindergartens\" project trained 600 specialists from 60 kindergartens to work during the 2023-2024 school year with over 8,000 children on the \"Let's be friends\" methodology, which is based on the philosophy that a strong sense of community and positive relationships between children prevent exclusion and bullying. Besides training, the 60 kindergartens also received the package of educational resources to be used by the educators and integrated into their daily routine of activities with children and parents.\n\n#### **Vocational School**\n\nOMV Petrom continued to support dual education in Romania with donations of around EUR 300,000 in 2023. The Petrochemical School is a dual-system program supported by OMV Petrom. The future petrochemists benefit from professional training in the field of petrochemicals and internships at the Petrobrazi refinery. Approximately 100 students received scholarships worth up to EUR 130 during their studies. We have almost 100 students in the four dual education classes, and three classes with around 75 students graduated in 2023. Upon completion of the three years of vocational education (petrochemical operators' qualification), students will acquire a recognized professional qualification and will have employment opportunities within our Company. The Petrochemical School program is a pilot project with the aim of assuring a constant and sustainable flow of a high-quality bluecollar workers.\n\n#### **SapuraOMV Upgrades Water Gravity Pipes and a School Library**\n\nSince 2023, SapuraOMV has collaborated with the Kuching Resident Office as part of their Village Transformation program. One project involved partly upgrading an existing water gravity pipe network that links fresh clean water from the waterfall dam to the nearby village (Kampung Seboboq), which currently has 119 households and over 700 residents in the B40 category. By upgrading the water gravity pipes, the villagers will have access to fresh clean water with no disruption.\n\nThe second project with the Kuching Resident Office's Village Transformation program is to upgrade the existing library at Tringgus Elementary School. It has been 20 years since the school's wooden library received any upgrades. The donation will go toward purchasing new tables and chairs plus reference and reading materials for both teachers and schoolchildren. In addition to that, SapuraOMV will also be running a donation drive to collect used story books for the library.\n\n#### **House of Science, New Zealand**\n\nIn partnership with House of Science, 418 science resource kits have been delivered to 37 local Taranaki schools in New Zealand. This enables children to further explore the subject of science in primary schools.\n\n#### **Cultural Treasures for Our Youth**\n\nAs part of OMV's sponsoring partnerships, we provide targeted support for educational and youth activities in all our projects and give young people access to art and culture. For many years, we have invited children and young people from Max & Lara from our partner CAPE 10 to experience and learn from cultural events organized by our sponsoring partners. In 2023, over 100 children and their parents attended such events organized by OMV sponsoring partners. This doesn't just provide opportunities to learn and experience art, but also to experience and participate in cultural life in our society. We therefore consider these opportunities as a contribution to our social responsibility.\n\n#### **CODY21: Digital Education Program in Austria**\n\nAs digitalization is becoming more and more important to the youngest members of society, we are offering virtual\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle with an arrow going around it.\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\neducation in elementary schools in Lower Austria through interactive video units on basic digital education. OMV finances the CODY21 platform and thus makes an important social contribution to education and equal opportunities for a total of 3,200 school children in OMV's partner communities. In 2023, we also donated 400 laptops to partnering schools with the aim of providing more possibilities for pupils and teachers in regard to digitalization.\n\n#### **WELCOME TO THE FUTURE! Exhibition**\n\nBorealis has been one of the main sponsors of the ZOOM Children's Museum in Vienna, Austria, since 2013. The ZOOM Children's Museum and Borealis share the common goal of helping to make complex sustainability issues understandable for the younger generation, getting them excited about science and research, and sharpening their skills for future challenges. In 2023, the Borealis Social Fund and the ZOOM Children's Museum in Vienna celebrated the opening of a new hands-on exhibition, WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!, which deals with the sustainability challenges of tomorrow's world. For this purpose, ZOOM has transformed the exhibition hall into a Future Lab where artists, scientists, and experts from a wide variety of areas contributed their ideas for our future. The ZOOM Children's Museum welcomes children to ask questions, to touch and to feel, to examine and to play to their heart's content. In their own individual way, they zoom in on objects and situations and, in doing so, find out about themselves and discover their own skills, abilities, and creativity.\n\n#### **Ecopost for Fair and Regular Income Generation**\n\nBorealis and Ecopost formed a collaboration where Borealis will fund Ecopost's activities to boost waste recycling in Kenya and to promote a circular economy in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Borealis will specifically support capacity building, training, and engaging more waste collectors, as well as formalization of their work by funding entrepreneurial start-up kits for the youth and women's groups.\n\nAdditional projects contributing to SDGs 4, 5, 8, and 10 can be found on the [OMV website](https://www.omv.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility/community-projects-initiatives).\n\n#### **Impact Snapshot: Climate, Energy, and Circular Resource Management**\n\nClimate and environmental changes inevitably affect communities around the world and their livelihoods, health, and opportunities. We can no longer afford to tackle the social challenges the world faces without recognizing the extent of the effects environmental changes can have on people and their health and well-being. Climate change, access to sustainable energy, and environmental protection are key priorities in our community and social development efforts.\n\n#### **Environmental initiatives supported by the Petrom Foundation**\n\nPart of the environmental initiatives of the Petrom Foundation is the Green for Future program, which invested EUR 1 mn in Vânători-Neamt Natural Park. The focus is on enhancing the biodiversity conservation, wildlife management, and community development. Furthermore, the Green for the Alpha Generation program developed students' skills in addressing climate change in their communities and benefited 147 teachers and 2,900 pupils across 26 counties through curricula and projects aimed at combating climate change.\n\n#### **RoEficientă: Energy Efficiency in Romania**\n\nRomânia Eficientă is a unique initiative in Romania that aims to create a culture of energy efficiency in the building sector. There are two main components and goals that drive this project: firstly, information, education, and public awareness, and secondly, carrying out major renovations based on NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings) standards at a couple of the public schools in Romanian counties, including building a pilot school in Ploiești. This initiative is strongly backed by the energy and climate policies in the European Union and is largely centered around the principle of energy efficiency.\n\nThe project becomes all the more important in the context of the European Green Deal, which places great emphasis on energy efficiency, one of the main pillars of the new European policies, and on building renovation. In 2023, we decided to launch a new concept, more applicable to the current educational needs, in addition to what we are already doing. In order to show and explain the impact of school renovation and the multiple benefits of modern energy-efficient buildings, this new educational concept is based on direct learning from specialists. Therefore, through visits to school and universities, we will focus on educating the children and young people, creating educational materials (which can be accessed anywhere and anytime from the official platform [https://www.romania-efi](https://www.romania-eficienta.ro/)[cienta.ro/\\)](https://www.romania-eficienta.ro/), educating teachers to promote energy efficiency measures to the younger generation, and educating the general public through practical experiences/models (school renovations, Doza de Energie/Energy Dose video productions and influencers).\n\nThe Liliești High School was the largest private investment for the energy renovation of an educational establishment in Romania (worth up to EUR 1.6 mn). By renovating to NZEB standard, the school will have less impact on the environment and will also be more resilient to the impact of climate change. The refurbishment works at Liliești High School will result in an annual reduction of around 60% in the energy consumption for heating the building. The fivepump heat system contributes to this result. In addition,\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular body.

The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nthe school will benefit from \"green\" electricity, obtained from its own sources, through a system of 30 photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 550W each. Its inauguration took place on March 20, 2023.\n\nRomânia Eficientă has reached its fourth phase, which means renovation works at the Zig-Zag Kindergarten in Ovidiu (Constanța) are in full swing, with completion estimated for March 2024. The kindergarten has undergone an extensive renovation process, including works to increase energy performance to bring it up to NZEB requirements and consolidation and capacity expansion works. The building will be upgraded from energy efficiency class E (lowest limit class G) to the highest energy class (A). Total annual energy consumption will be reduced by more than 60% and carbon emissions by about six times. The building will be equipped with renewable energy systems, i.e., photovoltaic panels and heat pumps. In parallel, we have also started preparing the documentation for a school in Șimian (Mehedinți).\n\n#### **OMV Petrom Supports Circular Economy Projects with Social Impact**\n\nIn 2023, OMV Petrom continued several initiatives to raise awareness about the circular economy and foster the transition to a circular economy in Romania. For instance, circular economy initiatives with social impact include the \"Let's Click on Romania\" project, a collaboration between private companies and the NGO Ateliere fără Frontiere. In this project, 4,000 computers were refurbished and donated by private companies to over 200 institutions such as schools, NGOs and kindergartens, reducing CO2 emissions by around 500 t. The project also proposes a model of good practice at the national level regarding the circular economy, and through this example provides access for young people from marginalized rural and urban environments to a better education. This includes resources related to the transition to a green economy, an area still undeveloped in rural areas even though it is a necessary one for the evolution of human society as a whole. The project endeavors to have a positive impact on the environment by reusing and donating electronic waste to equip the school's computer labs and classrooms, thus extending their life cycle. NGOs have also managed to incorporate some very rarely mentioned subjects into school life: circular economy, reusing materials, and sustainability.\n\nOMV Petrom supports a circular project by giving furniture a new life in 18 communities in Romania. In 2023, it redirected over 4,400 pieces of furniture to communities in Constanța, Prahova, Dâmbovița, Olt, Dolj, Arges, Brasov Buzau, Bucuresti, and Iași counties.\n\n#### **Waste and Resource Efficiency: Project STOP**\n\nEnvironmental pollution caused by littering is a global challenge. Millions of tons of plastic waste leak into the environment and oceans every year. Mismanaged waste is adversely affecting the region's ocean ecosystems, livelihoods, human health, and sustainable development more broadly. An important solution is to accelerate the transformation toward a circular economy. A key enabler for this is stopping waste leakage at the source by establishing lowcost, efficient, and circular waste management systems.\n\n#### **Project STOP Highlights 2023**\n\nCo-founded by Borealis and Systemiq, with broad support from national and regional governments, international institutions, academia, and the private sector, Project STOP focuses on delivering measurable impact on the ground. Since its inception in 2017, it has steadily extended from the first city of Muncar to two more cities, Pasuruan and Jembrana. To ensure the system continues to function effectively after formal handover, a comprehensive education program was developed in the three cities to train municipal employees, and the Project STOP team will remain available for support and advice. Read more about Project STOP in the [Borealis Annual Report.](https://www.borealisgroup.com/about-us/debt-investor-relations/results-and-reports)\n\nA key highlight in 2023 was the inauguration of a new material recovery facility (MRF) in Songgon Municipality, Banyuwangi, East Java, representing a key milestone on the path to building Indonesia's first regency-led circular waste management system as part of the Project STOP Banyuwangi Hijau expansion plan. One of the largest of its kind in Indonesia to date, the new MRF will manage waste collection and sorting from households in the region, including materials to be recycled, with a daily capacity to process up to 84 t of waste. The MRF will collect all waste, including 3,300 t of plastic waste per year, at full scale by 2025. This expansion program consists of three consecutive phases and was kicked off in early 2023, with completion scheduled for the end of 2025. By that time, Project STOP aims to positively impact the lives of up to 2 mn residents, create 1,000 full-time jobs, and annually collect 230,000 t of waste, including the 25,000 t of plastic that has been collected since the inception of Project STOP in 2017.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

To gain a better overview of all our projects we promote communication on our media channels. Consistent communication ensures a single strategic approach and supports OMV's social responsibility objectives and its reputation.\n\nIn 2024, we will review our prioritization of focus areas in line with our sustainability strategy and define common Groupwide areas that take into consideration the ongoing energy transition and climate change. We will also continue our ongoing social projects to meet the needs of people in the communities where we do business.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of social investments in all countries where we conduct business or operate, also including in times of crisis, a target has been clearly defined in the Strategy 2030. Based on this, we want to implement a social fund so we can act immediately and in a straightforward way, especially in the event of acute problems such as disasters or humanitarian crises, and provide long-term perspectives for our project partners. Furthermore, we want to provide consistent communication about our programs. OMV fully benefits from the high impact and visibility of relevant projects and initiatives.\n\nImage /page/138/Figure/15 description: The image shows information about targets and status related to social goals. The target for 2030 is to direct at least 1% of Group investments per year toward social goals, based on the previous year's reported net income attributable to stockholders of the parent. The status for 2023 is 1.2%. The most relevant SDGs are SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). SDG target 1.4 states that by 2030, all men and women, particularly the poor and vulnerable, should have equal rights to economic resources.\n\naccess to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance\n\n**8.3** Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services\n\n<sup>51</sup> In 2023, OMV's reported net income attributable to stockholders of the parent was EUR 3,634 mn. Our social expenditures in 2023 were particularly high because of donations for humanitarian causes in Turkey and Libya. At OMV Petrom, EUR 23 mn was distributed after the end of the 2022 financial year. This distribution was facilitated by the new fiscal facility Form 177, approved by National Agency of Fiscal Administration Order No. 1679/2022, which is used to redirect the corporate tax, as applicable, toward sponsorship, patronage, or the granting of private scholarships.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a blue circle.\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles.

It is therefore imperative that we act in accordance with the highest ethical standards on an international level, everywhere we operate, and enforce these standards throughout our supply chain. Unethical behavior, such as corruption, hinders economic and sustainable development.\n\nOMV is a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, and we believe that sustainability starts with our value system and a principles-based approach to doing business. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. The Ethical Business Practices strategic focus area brings together our commitments and actions relating to the integrity of our employees and business partners. Establishing a culture of integrity is the baseline for the further adoption of the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, whether that is achieved by promoting local economic development through local procurement, or ensuring that our public policy engagement and work with suppliers is in line with OMV's climate commitments.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

In the upper left corner is the number \"16\" in white. To the right of the number, the words \"PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS\" are stacked in white, block letters. Below the text is a white dove holding an olive branch in its beak. Below the dove is a white gavel.\n\nOMV is defined by the way our people behave. Conducting business sustainably and ethically is crucial for OMV in creating and protecting value in the long term, in building trusting partnerships, and in attracting customers and the best suppliers, investors, and employees. We strive to comply with the most stringent legal requirements in areas such as anti-corruption and tax law, and to be transparent and implement sound corporate governance to ensure ethical behavior. The principles of corporate governance are a key element for the sustainable growth of the business, for enhancing long-term value for shareholders, and for strengthening stakeholder confidence.<sup>52</sup>\n\nOMV's Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics publicly lay out our commitments to responsible and ethical business conduct. OMV's Code of Business Ethics sets out a zero-tolerance policy on bribery, fraud, theft, and other forms of corruption, as well as money laundering, and prohibits any support of political parties or donations to them. This Code applies to all employees. It is designed to comply with the standards set by both national and international anti-corruption legislation (mainly the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and the UK Bribery Act). OMV is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and adheres to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These Guidelines reflect the government expectations of responsible conduct by businesses. They cover all key areas of business responsibility, including bribery, competition, and taxation. OMV has also published a separate Tax Policy.\n\n#### Governance\n\nUltimate responsibility for ensuring the ethical conduct of OMV while generating economic value lies with the Executive and Supervisory Boards. Responsibility for economic impacts and business principles is not centralized in one department, but rather distributed across various departments. For instance, the OMV Compliance Management System is implemented Group-wide through collaboration between central management units and local compliance officers in all countries in which OMV operates.\n\nThe Group's approach to tax and the risks related to it are monitored by the tax function (as part of Group Finance) and overseen by the CFO and the Supervisory Board. Tax compliance is generally dealt with by finance managers, and at legal entity level by local tax managers, shared service centers, or external tax advisors. OMV's Tax Compliance functions and departments report to OMV's CFO.\n\nThe Public Affairs and International Relations team is the OMV Group's interface with the relevant political and public administration decision-makers. It informs stakeholders in Austria as well as at EU and international level about OMV's business, so that they understand how the oil, gas, and chemical industry works, the challenges it faces today, and the contribution it will make in the future. Relationships with stakeholders are sustainable and based on transparency and mutual trust. Public Affairs and International Relations reports to OMV's CEO.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nThe Company's management is committed to establishing and maintaining an ethical standard of trust and integrity in our day-to-day business. Our senior management signs a Compliance Declaration to confirm that their conduct is in line with the Code of Business Ethics. New members of senior management also receive personal onboarding conducted by Compliance to introduce OMV's integrity standards. In addition, once a year, all managers and employees in particularly exposed positions must sign a conflict of interest and business ethics conformity declaration.\n\nEach member of the Executive board (EB) and the Supervisory Board (SB) is personally trained by Compliance in all relevant compliance areas. In addition, there are regular Jour fixes and ad hoc meetings with the entire EB and with each individual member of the EB, regular Audit Committee meetings with the SB, and Jour fixes with the chairman of the SB, where compliance-related matters are reported and discussed.\n\n### Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption\n\nThe OMV Group is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. Although we are headquartered in Austria, a country with high standards of business ethics, we operate in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Americas, and Europe that are defined as high risk by the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. We strive to avoid the risks of bribery and corruption that are specific to our sector. We also highly value our reputation. Therefore, our highest priority is ensuring uniform compliance with our business ethics standards wherever we operate.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards is a non-negotiable value that supersedes any business interest. Absolute commitment to this objective is embedded at all levels of the OMV Group, from top management to every employee. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. Every company activity, from planning business strategy to daily operations, is assessed for compliance with ethical standards such as the [Code of Conduct](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522177201471/code-of-conduct.pdf) and [Code of Business Ethics.](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522138416551/business-ethics-brochure.pdf)\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nThe OMV Group follows a zero-tolerance policy regarding bribery, fraud, theft, and other forms of corruption, as well as money laundering. Based on this policy, the OMV Group is committed to detecting any potential policy violations at the earliest stage, thoroughly investigating any such incidents of non-compliance, and determining appropriate organizational measures or sanctions for the individuals involved. The integrity of our employees is the\n\nfoundation of the trust placed in our Company by our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure that OMV's commitment to business integrity is clear, OMV has introduced a Code of Conduct53, which reflects both the required standards and the high expectations of our shareholders. The Code of Conduct expresses OMV's values and defines OMV's mindset in conducting business responsibly, with the focus on ethical and legal standards, among other things.\n\nThe Code of Conduct applies to all OMV Group employees. All suppliers and business partners are required to share OMV's values and comply with the defined ethical and legal standards. A separate Code of Business Ethics further describes how OMV fulfills ethical and legal responsibilities internally. It defines the rules and procedures for conflicts of interest, gifts and invitations, donations and sponsorships, intermediaries and lobbyists, as well as for other areas of law such as trade sanctions, money laundering, and fair competition. OMV has also implemented regulations for compliance with capital markets law, including the prevention of insider trading. These regulations are included in a separate guideline: the Issuer Compliance Standard.\n\nBoth the Code of Conduct and the Code of Business Ethics are signed by the OMV Executive Board and apply in all countries where OMV does business. The procedures established by these documents are implemented at every fully consolidated subsidiary of OMV and apply to everyone who works for OMV or on behalf of OMV. We require compliance with international business principles from all parties with whom we enter into partnership agreements, such as joint ventures. Companies performing services for OMV (i.e., suppliers) must follow antibribery and anti-corruption procedures that are consistent with the principles of OMV's Code of Business Ethics and with OMV's business ethics standards, as defined in the Code of Conduct (for more details, see Supply Chain).\n\nThe internal Whistleblowing Directive lays out how employees and external stakeholders can confidentially and anonymously make a whistleblowing report, particularly regarding corruption and bribes, conflicts of interest, competition law, and capital markets law. The Directive also specifies how cases are handled and defines special protection for whistleblowers against any form of retaliation, which comprises all actions or omissions in a workrelated context such as dismissal, demotion, denial of promotion, negative performance appraisal, or disciplinary measures.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/2 description: The image contains three blue icons inside blue circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\nOMV has set up a comprehensive Compliance Management System based on the requirements of IDW PS 980<sup>54</sup>, including policies, audits, and training. The system aims to anchor OMV's business ethics policies throughout the organization and to ensure their correct implementation.\n\nThe design and implementation of OMV's Compliance Management System have repeatedly been externally audited for adequacy and effectiveness. The result of each audit was that OMV's system is appropriately designed and effectively implemented in order to prevent, detect, and respond to systematic misconduct in the legal areas of business ethics/anti-corruption, capital market law, competition law, and trade sanctions.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments and Audits**\n\nBoth external and internal risk factors, in particular changes to the regulatory framework, as well as recent developments or incidents, are monitored on an ongoing basis to evaluate their possible impact on OMV's current risk exposure. This ongoing risk analysis also includes an institutionalized semi-annual risk analysis, which is part of OMV's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM). If new risks are identified, OMV undertakes measures to address them.\n\nBefore we launch activities in a new country, we perform a thorough analysis of business ethics and sanction law issues in that country. The Business Ethics Entry Assessment includes an analysis of the Corruption Perceptions Index assigned by Transparency International to a given country. Based on the outcome of the assessment, corporate governance in local operations is adapted to assure compliance with OMV's ethical standards. OMV has implemented a process for screening both potential new and existing business partners using EU and US sanction lists. In addition to those sanction checks, more exhaustive due diligence assessments are conducted prior to engagement with a business partner or during the business relationship as needed.\n\nCritically, counterparties in M&A transactions, strategic partnerships, or business partners that have been in the media spotlight in the context of illegal conduct are assessed in greater depth. Such an assessment involves the potential business partner, their direct and indirect shareholders, other investors, and the ultimate beneficiaries of directly or indirectly involved legal entities. To that end, OMV uses its standardized know-your-customer (KYC) questionnaire to request information from counterparties so they can assess corruption, money laundering, sanctions, and other illicit conduct risks.\n\nKey red flags are connections to government officials, other individuals, and companies referred to in high-attention media reports related to political and corruption cases, sanctioned entities, or any other suspected involvement in illegal conduct. In cases where intermediaries, lobbyists, or consultants are engaged, we use a third-party service provider to do comprehensive research, including source inquiries. Furthermore, vendor assessments are conducted by the OMV Procurement department.\n\nIn 2022, Borealis was certified according to ISO 37301 (Compliance Management) and ISO 37001 (Anti-Bribery Management Systems) by Austrian Standards following a two-phase audit process conducted by Taylor Wessing.\n\n#### **Whistleblowing**\n\nWe have established channels to help identify ethical misconduct as early as possible. Timely notification is crucial for taking precautionary measures directed at avoiding or mitigating major financial loss or reputational harm. If an employee observes or becomes aware of potential or actual misconduct or violation of internal rules or statutory regulations, whether committed by other employees or by a business partner, that employee is encouraged to speak up and report the incident.\n\nBesides employees, other stakeholders also represent a valuable source of information, and can help identify breaches of ethical standards. To this end, the OMV Group has introduced a whistleblower mechanism – the Integrity Platform. Anyone can access it online ([omv-group.integri](https://omv-group.integrityplatform.org/)[typlatform.org](https://omv-group.integrityplatform.org/)) and confidentially report an issue, be it related to topics such as corruption, bribes, conflicts of interest, antitrust law, or capital markets law. The report can be filed anonymously, if desired. In addition, Borealis has an Ethics Hotline that is available in 24 languages and allows employees and external stakeholders to raise concerns anonymously.\n\nSpecial protection is given to employees in their capacity as whistleblowers when information is provided in good faith. Notifications will not lead to any disadvantages at any time. Any whistleblowing report is treated with the strictest confidence, carefully checked in all regards, and further handled by the Whistleblowing Committee, which includes members of senior management.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nIt is of strategic importance for us to make sure that every single employee is fully aware of our ethical values and principles. Business ethics training includes training employees on dealing with invitations, gifts, and potential conflicts of interest. In addition, employees are trained in the topics of donations and sponsorships, as well as the\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left-pointing arrow. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow.\n\nrequirements for dealing with intermediaries and lobbyists.\n\nThe online training module in business ethics, which is rolled out biannually, is aimed at all employees of the OMV Group, while participants in classroom training courses are selected according to risk-specific criteria, such as working in the Sales or Procurement departments. The training on antitrust law that we provide focuses on the rules for dealing with competitors, customers, and suppliers. Participants in online and face-to-face training sessions are selected and invited to attend a regular training cycle according to risk-specific criteria. All target groups are defined at the beginning of the training cycle based on the existing organization. Organizational and personnel changes during a training cycle are continuously taken into account.\n\n#### **Raising Awareness**\n\nOMV has launched a compliance app that employees can use on their cell phones, providing easily accessible resources and related tools for all compliance-related matters. Employees can submit inquiries on all ethics topics, for instance gifts, invitations, or conflicts of interest, have their sponsorships or donations checked and registered, have new business partners checked against trade sanction and embargo lists, learn how to deal with inside information and file for trading approval, submit inquiries with regards to antitrust matters and obtain guidance, retrieve useful guidance on all ethics topics, and submit reports on ethical misconduct via the secure Integrity Platform messaging service.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n**26** whistleblowing cases in the OMV Group\n\n**0** incidents of corruption, **0** incidents when contracts with business partners or employees were terminated or not renewed due to violations related to corruption\n\n**0** public legal cases involving corruption brought against the organization or its employees during the reporting period\n\n**3** legal actions pending during the reporting period with regard to anti-corruption activities and violations of antitrust and monopoly legislation, in which the organization has been identified as a participant<sup>55</sup>\n\nIn 2023, OMV's Compliance Management System was audited by Ernst & Young (EY) in accordance with the Auditing Standard (PS) 980 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) in the areas of business ethics/anticorruption, antitrust law, capital market law, and trade sanctions. The aim of the audit was to reevaluate the Compliance Management System for the aforementioned compliance areas in order to make any necessary adjustments and align with new trends. In its audit report, EY confirmed that OMV operates an ambitious, well-established, and mature compliance program. OMV's Compliance Management System is appropriately designed for all compliance areas and is effectively implemented across the OMV Group.\n\nIn addition, OMV introduced a new Ethics & Integrity Policy that defines the principles of what it means to act ethically and with integrity. This policy should guide the way that business is conducted within OMV, what is considered acceptable or desirable behavior, above and beyond compliance with laws and regulations. The Ethics & Integrity Policy forms a part of OMV's values and underpins OMV's value \"we care.\" The Ethics & Integrity Policy is supported by a newly established Ethics & Integrity Committee, which shall provide reassurance that the organization is living up to its ethical values and commitments.\n\nIn 2023, Borealis received recertifications for ISO 37301 and ISO 37001. It also implemented new policies and processes to manage social compliance and external whistleblowing, including an improved due diligence, monitoring, auditing, and escalation procedure for business partners. The outcome was an updated Ethics Policy for Business Partners, which includes new compliance requirements for supplier contracts.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, the Ethics & Integrity Policy will be consistently implemented through various communications initiatives and engagement measures in local branch offices. At an entity level, Borealis will seek certification for Social Compliance Standard SA8000 and recertifications for ISO 37301 and ISO 37001.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, the Competition Council in Moldova initiated an investigation into several oil companies, including Petrom Moldova SRL, in relation to the manner of determining sale prices of main petroleum products and LPG. On April 12, 2021, Petrom Moldova SRL received a statement of objections from the Competition Council regarding an alleged price fixing practice. Petrom Moldova SRL submitted its observations to the statement of objections in July 2021 and denied any wrongdoing. The hearing of the parties took place on April 5, 2022. On October 6, 2020, the Polish Competition Authority UOKiK issued a decision with respect to OMV's financing of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. In this decision, UOKiK concluded that this financing arrangement breaches Polish merger control rules and imposed a fine of EUR 19.571 mn on OMV. OMV appealed that decision. On November 21, 2022, the Polish Competition Court annulled in its entirety the decision of UOKiK. On October 16, 2023, the Polish Court of Appeals dismissed UOKiK's appeal against that judgment. As a result, UOKiK's decision to fine OMV was canceled by the Polish courts. In September 2023, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine started an investigation into OMV Gas Marketing Trading & Finance BV for allegedly performing a \"concerted action\" by entering into the Nord Stream 2 financing agreements. OMV contested the allegations on October 31, 2023. 55\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

We pay corporate income taxes, royalties, production taxes, stamp duties, as well as employment and other taxes. In addition, we collect and pay payroll taxes, and indirect taxes such as excise duties and VAT. The taxes we collect and pay represent a significant part of our economic contribution to the countries in which we operate.\n\n#### **Specific Policies and Commitments**\n\nAt OMV, we are committed to complying with tax laws in a responsible manner and to having open and constructive relationships with tax authorities, which is also reflected in OMV's public [Tax Strategy.](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522188630446/dload_Sustainability_Tax%20Strategy_en) Our tax planning supports OMV's business and reflects our commercial and economic activity. OMV does not engage in aggressive tax planning, which consists of artificial structures put in place merely to save taxes or of transactions lacking economic substance aimed at obtaining undue tax advantages. We comply with applicable tax laws and seek to limit the risk of uncertainty or disputes. We perform transactions between OMV Group companies on an arm's length basis and in accordance with the OECD principles currently in force.\n\nOMV Group companies are established in suitable jurisdictions, giving consideration to our business activities and the prevailing regulatory environment. OMV does not establish its subsidiaries in countries that do not follow international\n\nstandards of transparency and exchange of information on tax matters, unless justified by operational requirements in line with OMV's Code of Business Ethics and our Code of Conduct. The Global Tax Directive is the key internal guidance document governing taxes within the OMV Group.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nWe continuously carry out risk reviews, which incorporate tax risks, in order to assess our current and future financial and non-financial risks, assess how these trends will impact OMV, and then develop appropriate responses. We report key risks internally at least twice a year to the Supervisory Board through a very clearly defined process. The Executive Board drives OMV's commitment to the risk management program and sets the tone for a strong culture of risk awareness across the organization.\n\nWe follow OMV's risk management system as part of our internal control processes. We identify, assess, and manage tax risks by implementing risk management measures at the operational level with a robust and complex set of controls and procedures. These guarantee that the correctness of data included in the relevant tax returns, tax payments, and communications with tax authorities is verified in a timely manner. The effectiveness and relevance of these controls and procedures is periodically\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\nassessed in order to promptly undertake any necessary mitigation and modifications.\n\n#### **Disclosure**\n\nSince 2016, OMV has been providing mandatory disclosures under the Payment to Governments Directive (in accordance with Section 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code) and publishes any payments made to governments in connection with exploration and extraction activities, such as production entitlements, taxes, or royalties, in its consolidated financial statements (for more details, see the Consolidated Report on the Payments Made to Governments in the [Annual Report](https://reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2023/further-information/payments-made-to-governments)). In addition, OMV reports payments made to public authorities, such as taxes or royalties in connection with exploration and extraction activities, in countries that are members of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). We also file a country-by-country report (CbCR) for the OMV Group with the Austrian tax authorities. This is carried out in accordance with Action 13 of the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. The CbCR is an annual tax return that breaks down key elements of the financial statements by tax jurisdiction. OMV will publish a public country-by-country report in accordance with the requirements of the relevant EU Directive (for more details with respect to the public country-by-country report and reporting deadlines, please refer to the Outlook section below).\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\n- In September 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on a framework for an EU-wide windfall tax on profits for fossil fuel companies. The Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 introduced a solidarity contribution that was transposed into the local legislation of the Member States by the end of 2022 and applies to 2022 and/or 2023. It represents a contribution of surplus profits of companies operating in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, and refinery sectors and is intended to fund relief measures for households and businesses facing high energy prices.\n- With the eco-social tax reform having been adopted in Austria, a national CO2 emissions price was implemented in October 2022. The national CO2 emissions price applies to defined energy carriers according to defined emissions factors. As an energy provider, OMV will be charged a fixed CO2 emissions price that will be increased annually until 2026, before a market-based system is put in place. Generally, OMV supports the creation of such economic and socio-political incentives for more climatefriendly behavior; however, we favor the creation of a harmonized, EU-wide system.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nTaxation as a key steering instrument toward an ecofriendly, green economy is playing a major role in the current initiatives of the EU, OECD member states, and the Austrian government.\n\n- In 2021, the members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreed to reform international tax rules by implementing new rules for profit allocation (Pillar One) and establishing a global minimum taxation regime (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the Council of the European Union reached a unanimous agreement to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This Directive (2022/2523) aims to ensure that large groups operating in the EU are taxed at a minimum global effective tax rate of 15% in each country in which those groups have business activities. Member States were obligated to transpose these rules into domestic law by December 31, 2023, and the rules are effective from January 1, 2024.\n- In 2021, the European Council, European Parliament, and European Commission reached an agreement on the proposed Public Country-by-Country reporting (CbCR) Directive. Member States were obligated to transpose the Directive into national law by June 2023 and the first reportable year is 2025, with a reporting deadline of the end of 2026.\n- In December 2022, the European Commission proposed the VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) reforms to amend the European Union (EU) Value Added Tax (VAT) system in response to the challenges of digitalization. The mandatory e-invoicing, which should be implemented by January 2028, should help to close the VAT gap. Many other states (e.g., Germany, Romania, etc.) are currently planning to introduce or have already introduced local e-invoicing/ reporting requirements that should also strengthen the VAT base and make tax a driver for innovation and growth due to the elimination of manual tasks and automation of invoice processing.\n- Currently, only some countries in the EU have adopted a national CO2 emissions price for transport and buildings. In 2023, a new emissions trading system was created by the European Commission. The EU-wide Emissions Trading System 2 (ETS 2), covering fuel combustion in buildings, road transport, and additional sectors, is a crucial part of the EU's Fit for 55 package. It will put an absolute cap on emissions, which will decrease in line with a linear reduction factor. Allowances will be distributed exclusively via auctioning. The ETS 2 will be launched by 2027 or 2028, with monitoring and reporting obligations already starting in 2025.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons. The first icon is a printer inside a circle. The second icon is a left arrow inside a circle. The third icon is a right arrow inside a circle.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 was the first period when the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the world's first carbon border tax, entered into force in the European Union. The transitional phase started on October 1, 2023, and applies initially to imports of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. The CBAM was designed to level the playing field between EU and third-country producers by putting a carbon price on certain imported products, while phasing out free allocation of emissions allowances to European industry. In the first phase, the CBAM is only about reporting but not yet about paying a CO<sup>2</sup> price.<sup>56</sup>\n\n## Public Policy\n\nOMV's public policy engagement is fully committed to the Business Strategy 2030, which is based on the Paris Agreement and aim to reach a net zero target in all three scopes by 2050 at the latest. We recognize that the regulatory framework can help achieve progress on issues such as resource efficiency, which includes reducing waste and marine litter thanks to the implementation of a circular economy, climate change, safety improvements, and fair trade. Interaction with governments and regulators takes place at international, European, national, and local levels. Regulators, political stakeholders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can all shape the regulatory framework that affects the Group's business. Therefore, the OMV Group needs to understand the policy, regulatory, and NGO environment and ensure that it can contribute its knowledge and insight to discussions regarding the future of the regulatory framework.\n\nThe OMV Group is a member of industry associations that support the understanding of issues, share knowledge, help develop standards, and provide input to regulatory authorities on behalf of the sector. OMV's association activities make an important contribution to the broader debate on a sustainable, affordable, and secure energy future, as well as sustainable chemicals and materials. Both the energy transition and the transformation from a linear to a circular economy can only succeed if all stakeholders, including legislators, businesses, and society, engage in productive debates. As a voice from the world of business, associations participate in precisely these important debates and contribute their proven expertise on various aspects of policy.\n\n#### **Management and Due Diligence Processes**\n\n#### **Direct Political Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group is active in economic policy but does not support political parties – neither financially nor in any other way. Donations to political parties are not permitted as per the Code of Business Ethics. Activities organized by political parties are not allowed on the premises of the OMV Group. There are no restrictions for individual OMV employees on engaging in political or public functions or engaging with special interest groups within the framework of legitimate secondary employment. However, it is not permitted to associate the OMV Group with such activities. As with other secondary employment, employees must conclude an agreement with OMV that regulates the details of such activities. Employees must disclose a conflict of interest between the exercising of political or other public functions and their employment with the OMV Group to their line manager and to Compliance.\n\n#### **Indirect Political Engagement**\n\nThe OMV Group exchanges views on regulatory issues with the responsible political decision-maker(s) and actively participates in EU and national public consultations on legislative initiatives that are relevant to the Group's business. It is an active member of industry associations and standardization groups at international, EU, and national levels to stay at the forefront of regulatory and public requirements. The OMV Group representatives make OMV's position clear on the issues tackled by the associations of which we are members. It aims to inform EU policies by engaging with major industry associations such as Fuels Europe, the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), Plastics Europe, and the Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform (PCEP).\n\n#### **Transparency**\n\nOur practices are fully in line with all reporting obligations at national and EU levels, and we are fully compliant with all transparency requirements. Interaction with governments and regulators takes place at international, European, national, and local levels.\n\n#### **Monitoring Participation in Industry Associations**\n\nAssociations aim to adopt positions that reflect a consensus view among members, and thus may not always reflect the view of each individual member. We continuously monitor our membership of associations and their positions on issues so we can consider whether our memberships remain appropriate. As part of our commitment to transparency on climate action, we report not only on our own position and action on climate change, but also on the position of the key industry associations of which we are a member. The OMV Group also regularly reports on the alignment between the industry associations of which we are a member, including OMV's position on climate change policies. Read our latest review [here](https://www.omv.com/services/downloads/00/omv.com/1522202741166/dload_OMVs%20Industry%20Association%20Memberships%20Update2021_EN).\n\nIn cases of misalignment, particularly partial misalignment, we will first advocate for changes to the association's position. Where OMV and an association's position\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\ncontinues to fail to align, especially in cases of complete misalignment, we will reassess our membership. The OMV Group plans to regularly publish an update on its industry associations review and to expand the scope of review further.\n\n#### **2023 Actions**\n\nThe following key activities were carried out across the Group in 2023:\n\n- In 2023, the finalization of the Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU were among the most relevant regulatory issues for the OMV Group in the EU. The former included dossiers like the Renewable Energy Directive III, the EU Emissions Trading System, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the Energy Efficiency Directive, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. The OMV Group monitored the legal development and contributed to the positioning of the industry associations. A new topic that came up in 2023 was the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The OMV Group focused particularly on the Net-Zero Industry Act in the context of this package.\n- The hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package and the methane emissions regulation are currently being discussed and were due to be finalized by the end of 2023. The REMIT II Regulation came up as a new topic and is also under review. With regards to the security of gas supply, the Austrian preventive action plan was updated in the reporting year and the EU Energy Platform (AggregateEU) was still an ongoing project with participation from OMV's side.\n- The OMV Group also monitored the development and contributed to industry association positions on several ongoing negotiations in the area of implementing the Circular Economy Action Plan. Negotiations are ongoing as regards several key files, including the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, the Endof-Life Vehicles Regulation, the Waste Shipment Regulation, and discussions on a global instrument to end plastic pollution.\n- Sustainable finance legislation, including the EU taxonomy, was also on the agenda and the OMV Group participated in the relevant working groups at industry associations.\n- In 2023, the European Chemicals Agency put forward a proposal to restrict the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the EU. The OMV Group supported the detailed analyses conducted by associations in this regard.\n- Among the associations' governing boards and task forces, OMV Petrom continued to promote and advocate for a stronger and express commitment and similar initiatives to the targets of the Paris Agreement. Consequently, FIC and ARPEE have elaborated a dedicated stance on the matter. Alongside these endeavors, OMV Petrom committed its expertise and resources to extending the scope of activity of FPPG, with the aim of promoting green technologies (geothermal energy, carbon capture, transport and storage, hydrogen, photovoltaics, biofuels, and biomethane) and ensuring their successful deployment in Romania by shaping a common vision of their demand and benefits. OMV Petrom is thereby contributing to the understanding of the economic and environmental reasoning and implications and raising awareness of the existing bottlenecks among all concerned stakeholders.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\nIn 2024, the European Green Deal, the 2040 climate targets, and initiatives regarding the circular economy will be the most relevant regulatory packages for the OMV Group in the EU. The OMV Group will also follow any developments with regards to the European Carbon Management Strategy, and the upcoming European elections in 2024. Likewise, the OMV Group will closely monitor upcoming public consultations.\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine and current developments in the Middle East might continue to trigger unpredictable developments, which will require flexible solutions. As an important pillar for more sustainable energy, the OMV Group will continuously analyze and engage in projects that contribute to accelerating the clean energy transition and circular economy – as well as the regulatory framework of such projects. With regards to the security of gas supply, the focus will remain on the Austrian preventive action plan and the EU Energy Platform (AggregateEU).\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue outlined circle with a white house icon inside.

The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\n#### **Material Topic: Supply Chain**\n\nConsidering social and environmental factors (e.g., business ethics, human rights, safety, and carbon footprint of suppliers) in supply chain management\n\n#### **Key GRIs NaDiVeG**\n\n- GRI 204: Procurement Practices 2016\n- GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment 2016\n- GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016\n\n- Respect for human rights\n- Employee and social concerns\n- Corruption Prevention\n- Environmental Concerns\n\n#### **Most relevant SDG**\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/16 description: The image shows the Sustainable Development Goal 17 icon, which represents \"Partnerships for the Goals.\" The icon features the number \"17\" in the upper left corner, followed by the text \"PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\" in a smaller font. Below the text is a white graphic consisting of five overlapping circles arranged in a flower-like pattern, all set against a blue background.\n\nImplementing sustainable procurement means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the goods and services the Company intends to purchase. At OMV, we aim to foster innovation, maximize value contribution, and enable supply chain growth. We achieve this by applying our sourcing and logistics expertise to ensure that the highest-quality materials and services are provided throughout our supply chain. This involves working closely with our partners, contractors, and suppliers. It is of paramount importance to our organization to be fully compliant with all applicable legal requirements, as well as with our internal safety, environmental protection, and human rights standards when managing our supply chain. By integrating sustainability requirements throughout our supply chain (e.g., audits, assessments, sustainability criteria in sourcing) we aim to drive a positive change in the sustainability performance of our suppliers and contractors while mitigating potential negative impacts such as economic disturbance due to delays in payment. Our purchased goods and services are for all our business areas (Chemicals & Materials, Energy, and Fuels & Feedstock) and include, among others, those related to raw materials, wells, IT, consultancy, engineering, logistics, and retail.\n\n### Specific Policies and Commitments\n\nTo mitigate supply chain risks, including forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and corruption, the OMV Group imposes the legal requirements and internal rules and standards applicable to OMV on its suppliers. Our suppliers are obligated to fully comply with the content of the OMV Code of Conduct, and our supply chain partners are\n\nrequired to sign the OMV Code of Conduct. In addition, our suppliers must accept the OMV General Conditions of Purchase, which further detail our business standards (e.g., labor rights), as an integral part of our contractual agreements. OMV reserves the right to terminate relationships with suppliers if non-compliance with applicable policies is discovered or if non-compliance is not addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOMV's Corporate Procurement Directive was revised in 2023. Two of the main changes were the introduction of sustainability criteria as part of the commercial evaluation and sustainability embedded in the Supplier Relationship Management process. To ensure we have a standardized approach to payment conditions for our suppliers and contractors, we have 60-day standard payment terms stipulated in the Corporate Procurement Directive.\n\n#### Governance\n\nOMV Procurement is organized as an integrated function and covers day-to-day procurement activities across the entire OMV Group (including OMV Petrom and Borealis). OMV Procurement is led by the Chief Procurement Officer, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. From an organizational perspective, OMV Procurement is split into several Procurement Units that cover aspects such as Operations & Materials, Raw Materials & Packaging, and Retail & Business Services. A dedicated Sustainable Procurement & Supplier Innovation department established in April 2022 continued to work toward meeting the sustainable procurement ambitions and targets for 2025 and 2030.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons inside circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n### Management and Due Diligence Processes\n\n#### **Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)**\n\nA new SRM framework was developed in 2022 and subsequently rolled out in 2023, with the focus on managing the strategic relationship with our suppliers and contractors. Thanks to the new SRM framework, sustainability is now part of supplier segmentation, supplier performance, supplier meetings, and supplier innovation.\n\nTo support the OMV Group on its transformation journey to become a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, materials, and the circular economy, it is crucial to ensure that suppliers are encouraged to innovate. This helps unlock their potential, and the innovative solutions they develop provide an opportunity to enhance and strengthen partnerships between the Company, Procurement, and suppliers.\n\n#### **Prequalification**\n\nSupplier prequalification is part of precontractual activities, during which OMV collects information from a potential supplier with the purpose of evaluating compliance with our HSSE and sustainability requirements. The goal of the prequalification process is to screen potential suppliers before bringing them on board to ensure that only those suppliers that meet our HSSE and sustainability standards can be considered for future collaboration.\n\nThe prequalification is based on a standardized list of elements and objectives that aligns with the OMV Group's HSSE Management System (e.g., HSSE Policy, ISO 9001, 14001, 45001) and our Sustainability Framework (e.g., Sustainability Policy, Human Rights Policy, and Grievance Mechanisms). At Borealis, especially for raw materials and packaging, suppliers located in a so-called \"high-risk\" country are asked to submit a positive Together for Sustainability (TfS) Audit and Assessment report. We categorize high-risk countries by considering human rights, environmental, and ethical aspects.\n\n#### **Supplier Selection**\n\nFollowing prequalification, Procurement and business representatives select the best suppliers based on a predefined set of commercial and technical criteria during a tender process. To support the overall OMV Group Sustainability Targets 2030 and the Sustainable Procurement ambition to give sustainability a \"value\" in sourcing, the Procurement department included two criteria to assess the sustainability performance of the bidders in their commercial evaluation: the EcoVadis score and participation in the CDP Supply Chain.\n\n#### **Risk Assessments**\n\nUnderstanding a supplier's risk is an important factor in deciding whether and how we conduct business with the supplier. Since 2019, we have been receiving daily alerts about our registered suppliers through SAP Ariba. These enable us to monitor their risks in four categories: Environmental and Social, Finance, Regulatory and Legal, and Operations. These risk alerts help us apply a preventive risk management process. Furthermore, OMV has a screening process in place to ensure that parties sanctioned by the EU or international organizations, such as the United Nations, are not accepted as procurement partners.\n\n#### **Audits**\n\nOMV conducts two types of audits of its suppliers and contractors: on-site Together for Sustainability audits that focus on the sustainability performance of a company, and remote full-scope audits performed by an external auditor. The audits are carried out as part of the prequalification process and/or during contract execution. The aim of the audits is to measure the performance of our suppliers and define actions that will enable them to optimize their performance and meet OMV requirements. During the fullscope audits, we pay special attention to the financial stability of our suppliers, their strategy and organization, supply chain, sustainability (e.g., social and environmental issues), and their cybersecurity performance.\n\nEach audit finding classified with a red flag is followed up and analyzed by the Procurement team in collaboration with business representatives and any other relevant function (e.g., HSSE, Legal, Internal auditing, and Compliance). Information on the outcome of the audit is made available to the supplier, and the supplier is requested to submit a proposed corrective plan with concrete measures and an implementation timeline. In 2023, 22 audits resulted in follow-up measures.\n\n#### **Together for Sustainability (TfS)**\n\nSince 2021, OMV has been a member of Together for Sustainability (TfS). As a joint initiative and global network of 50 companies, TfS sets the de facto global standard for the environmental, social, and governance performance of chemical supply chains. The TfS program is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care®. Being a TfS member helps OMV further embed sustainability into its day-to-day business operations and further cascade sustainability requirements within our supply chain.\n\nThe OMV Procurement department has defined TfS-related targets for 2025 and 2030:\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle. The house is a simple line drawing with a pointed roof and a rectangular base. The circle is also a simple line drawing.\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/2 description: The image shows three blue icons in a row. The first icon is a printer inside of a circle. The second icon is a left-pointing arrow inside of a circle. The third icon is a right-pointing arrow inside of a circle.\n\n- By 2025, we aim to run sustainability evaluations (TfS Audits<sup>57</sup> and TfS Assessments58) for all suppliers covering >80% of the Procurement spend.\n- By 2030, we aim to extend sustainability evaluations (i.e., TfS Audits and TfS Assessments) to all suppliers covering 90% of the Procurement spend.\n\n#### **Supply Chain Carbon Transparency**\n\nWe aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon volume of our purchased goods and services. OMV is fully committed to climate change mitigation and responsible resource management. Only by working together with our suppliers will we be able to define joint low-carbon initiatives to continuously decrease the carbon emissions in the supply chain and meet our Paris Agreement commitments.\n\nAs part of its CDP Supply Chain membership, in 2023 OMV invited 394 suppliers to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire. Suppliers were selected based on spend, estimated carbon emissions volume, and the carbon intensity of the goods and services purchased from them. In addition to reporting their emissions, we asked the suppliers whether they have carbon reduction targets in place and invited them to share with us any initiatives or projects to reduce carbon emissions in which they would like us to participate.\n\n#### **Supplier Capacity Building**\n\nOMV works together with its suppliers to improve overall sustainability performance. For instance, in 2023, individual meetings and webinars were offered to our suppliers to help them better understand the requirements of the CDP climate change questionnaire or the TfS Assessment, and why this information is important to OMV. Additionally, the topics of sustainable and low-carbon procurement were also included in the agenda of our annual strategic supplier meetings (e.g., Innovation – How can we create sustainable value through innovation? Climate Change – How can we build successful alliances on the path to net zero? Circular Economy – How can we collaborate to effectively implement circular solutions?).\n\n#### **Local Content**\n\nWe aim to support the local communities in the locations where we operate by fostering economic development. Local procurement strengthens the local economy and meets the local procurement expectations of neighboring communities. Increased local procurement has had the added benefit of reducing business disruption in recent years, as well as the potential for a lower carbon footprint from the reduced transportation distance of the goods purchased. The spend with local suppliers in 2023 at Group level was 71.2%.\n\n### 2023 Actions\n\n**40** remote full-scope audits performed by OMV Procurement with an external auditor\n\n**224** TfS (Re)Assessments performed by EcoVadis\n\n**303** suppliers with a valid EcoVadis score (no more than 3 years old)\n\n**57%** of suppliers with improved EcoVadis score\n\n**8** TfS Audits performed in 2023\n\n**73** OMV suppliers have completed at least one sustainability training on the EcoVadis platform\n\n**394** suppliers invited to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire (vs. **231** in 2022)\n\n**205** buyers across all locations attended awareness sessions on sustainable procurement (**76%** of buyers)\n\n**1,022** new suppliers screened for social criteria (e.g., child labor, forced labor, and collective bargaining) and environmental criteria\n\n**71.2%** local spend value across the OMV Group (**89.6%** local spend value in Austria, **81.4%** in Belgium, **99.1%** in Romania)\n\nIn 2023, we actively engaged not only with our suppliers, but also with buyers on sustainable procurement and supplier innovation practices. 205 buyers from OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis participated in several awareness sessions throughout the year. The focus was on engaging buyers on sustainable procurement, supplier relationship management, and supplier innovation.\n\nIn October 2023, we organized the second Supplier Sustainability and Innovation Day, with the aim of interacting and exchanging experiences with our suppliers and having the opportunity to build a stronger and more sustainable supply chain. More than 350 participants from the suppliers' side and the OMV Group attended the event. Together with our suppliers, we addressed topics such as climate change, the circular economy, and innovation (e.g., Climate Change – How can we build successful alliances on the path to net zero? Circular Economy – How can we collaborate to effectively implement circular solutions? Innovation – How can we create sustainable value through innovation?). The key presenters from OMV Group included OMV Group CFO, CEO of OMV Petrom, CEO of Borealis, OMV Group SVP of Innovation & Technology, and OMV Group SVP of Procurement.\n\n<sup>57</sup> TfS Audits are conducted by an approved external auditor and can be on site, remote, or a hybrid of the two. They cover a single or combined business location such as a production site or warehouse. Sustainability performance is verified against a defined set of audit criteria.\n\n<sup>58</sup> TfS Assessments are conducted by TfS partner and service provider EcoVadis, a global leader in CSR assessments, via a secure online platform. The assessment questionnaire is adapted to the size, country of origin, and business sector of the company being assessed and results in a score at the end (the EcoVadis score).\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows a blue icon of a house inside of a circle.

Our three focus areas for the future will be:\n\n- Sustainable suppliers (e.g., only suppliers who meet OMV's sustainability requirements will be eligible to participate in tenders)\n- Sustainable sourcing (e.g., we will aim to integrate sustainability criteria into award decisions, such as CO2 emissions per kg product)\n- Low-carbon procurement (e.g., we will aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon volume of purchased goods and services)\n\n| Targets 2025       | Be an active member of TfS and conduct sustainability eval-<br>uations of all suppliers covering >80% of Procurement<br>spend59                                                                                                |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Engage with suppliers covering 80% of Procurement spend<br>and assess their carbon footprint as a foundation from<br>which to define and run joint low-carbon initiatives                                                      |\n| Targets 2030       | Extend sustainability evaluations to suppliers covering 90%<br>of Procurement spend<br>All suppliers covering >80% of Procurement spend to have<br>carbon reduction targets in place                                           |\n| Status 2023        | 40.6% of A suppliers (suppliers covering >80% of Procure-<br>ment spend) assessed<br>394 suppliers engaged with via CDP (vs. 231 in 2022)<br>71% of responding suppliers have a climate target in place<br>(vs. 75% in 2022)60 |\n| Most relevant SDGs | Image: SDG 8<br>Image: SDG 13<br>Image: SDG 16                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n#### **SDG targets:**\n\n**8.3** Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services\n\n**8.7** Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking, and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labor in all its forms\n\n**8.8** Protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment\n\n**13.1** Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries\n\n**16.5** Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms\n\nSuppliers covering 80% of Procurement spend are classed by OMV as A suppliers.

The number of suppliers with climate change targets in place is slightly lower compared to the previous year due to the fact that in 2023 we engaged more companies that are small- and medium-size enterprises and are only at the beginning of their sustainability journey. 59 60\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Performance in Detail\n\n## **IN THIS CHAPTER**\n\n- **EU Taxonomy Data**\n- **Economic Data**\n- **Safety Data**\n- **Environmental Data**\n- **Workforce Data**\n- **OMV AG Data**\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/153/Picture/1 description: The image contains three blue icons.

For instances of non-compliance that had a non-monetary penalty, no threshold for significance has been set and all are reported.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Two incidents at OMV Petrom Marketing SRL. In the first case, the National Authority for Consumer Protection, București County, deemed that OMV Petrom Marketing SRL failed to comply with measures in respect of consumer protection regarding the technical performance of the MaxxMotion 100 plus type fuel. For the second incidence of non-compliance at OMV Petrom Marketing SRL, the fines issued by the local police for different filling stations were not significant. However, they were recurring and non-monetary sanctions were also imposed. The fine paid by OMV Petrom Marketing SRL for operating with an expired permit totaled EUR 2,242.\n\n<sup>3</sup> Two out of the three incidents at OMV Petrom S.A. In both cases, the National Environmental Guard issued the fines due to OMV Petrom S.A. breaching provisions regarding different environmental regualtions. In the first case, a fine of EUR 10,000 was paid because of soil pollution occurring from the failure of a salt water transport pipeline functioning effectively in the Argeș District. In the second case, a fine of EUR 15,000 was paid because of gas and dust emissions affecting the air quality at the Petrobrazi refinery, in the Prahova District. In 2023, OMV Petrom began a general turnaround at the Petrobrazi refinery, which also included maintenance work and more than 20 modernization projects.\n\n<sup>4</sup> The third case is related to Borealis Kallo NV for violating the controlling rights of a public officer supervising environmental policy law. The case was appealed but lost and a total fine of EUR 16,422.11 was issued. Borealis Kallo NV is still to receive a payment request that will give the required information in order to proceed with the payment of this fine.\n\n<sup>5</sup> Four out of the five incidents were associated with various occurrences of non-compliance at OMV Petrom S.A. and OMV Petrom Marketing SRL. Significant fines were issued for two cases against OMV Petrom S.A. for breaching legal provisions on consumer protection and for failure to comply with the measures imposed by ANRE within the set deadline. The fines issued for the remaining two cases against OMV Petrom Marketing SRL were minor (total: EUR 2,600), however, the authority ordered the suspension of the activity at the gas station Târgu Bujor, for a month, and for 16 gas stations the authority ordered the loss of validity of the prevention against fires permit.\n\n<sup>6</sup> Included in this figure is a critical case in Romania, where in 2016, a child drowned in a pit filled with oil from an extraction well, which was not fenced. In December 2022, related to this, OMV Petrom S.A. was found guilty of manslaughter by the Găeşti District Court and was ordered to pay a criminal fine amounting to RON 28,000 (approx. EUR 5,700). On the civil side, the court assessed the degree of fault of OMV Petrom S.A. at 50%, and the company was obliged to pay moral damages of EUR 135,000 to the victim's family and material damages and other expenses in the total amount of RON 22,000 (approx. EUR 4,500). In 2023, OMV Petrom S.A. was found guilty and convicted for committing the crime of involuntary manslaughter. A total fine of EUR 100,000 was imposed by the Ploiești Court of Appeal, Prahova District, of which EUR 40,000 was paid to the civil parties and EUR 3,000 was paid as judicial expenses. Since the case occurred in 2016, OMV Petrom S.A. has ramped up its efforts to identify and secure the areas surrounding the wells and to apply relevant precautionary measures, e.g., fencing the areas around the well, installing grills above the well, and placing clear warning signs.\n\nn.r. = not reported\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons.

We use emission factors from different sources, e.g., IPCC, API GHG Compendium, etc. Since 2016, OMV has been applying global warming potentials of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4 – 100 years).\n\n<sup>2</sup> Decrease mainly driven by production shutdown in Yemen\n\n<sup>3</sup> Decrease mainly driven by the divestment of Borealis Nitro\n\n- <sup>4</sup> Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions resulting from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, or steam. We use emission factors from different sources, e.g., International Energy Agency, supplier-specific emission factors, etc. The data in the table refers to the market-based approach. Location-based is 0.8 mn t.\n- <sup>5</sup> Scope 3 refers to other indirect emissions that occur outside the organization, including both Upstream and Downstream emissions. We use emission factors from different sources, e.g., IPCC, PlasticsEurope, DBEIS, etc. The data includes Scope 3 emissions from the use and processing of sold products. Pure \"trading margin\" sales as well as intracompany sales are excluded. Since 2015, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods are included. Since 2018, net import of refinery feedstock is included.\n\n<sup>6</sup> Borealis Scope 3 category 15 emissions are accounted for as 19.9 mn t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent, but not yet included in OMV's Group consolidation.\n\n<sup>7</sup> 2022 data restated to reflect additional feedstock amounts that had previously not been included\n\nn.r. = not reported\n\n## GHG Emissions – Targets 2030<sup>1</sup>\n\n|                                            | Unit                | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2019 (baseline) |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|\n| Total GHG direct, Scope 1                  | mn t CO2 equivalent | 9.3   | 10.0  | 11.6  | 12.4            |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 6.5   | 7.2   | 8.4   | 9.2             |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 2.8   | 2.7   | 3.2   | 3.1             |\n| Total GHG indirect, Scope 2                | mn t CO2 equivalent | 1.0   | 0.8   | 0.9   | 1.3             |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 0.2   | 0.2   | 0.2   | 0.3             |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 0.8   | 0.6   | 0.7   | 0.9             |\n| Total GHG indirect, Scope 32               | mn t CO2 equivalent | 103.2 | 106.4 | 118.1 | 114.5           |\n| of which from energy business segments     | mn t CO2 equivalent | 87.4  | 90.0  | 100.2 | 96.5            |\n| of which from non-energy business segments | mn t CO2 equivalent | 15.9  | 16.3  | 17.8  | 18.1            |\n| Carbon intensity of energy supply3         | g CO2/MJ            | 69.1  | 67.5  | 67.4  | 69.8            |\n| Methane intensity4                         | %                   | 0.3   | 0.4   | 0.6   | 1.3             |\n\n<sup>1</sup> For the purpose of setting GHG emissions reduction targets, a meaningful and consistent comparison over time requires the setting of a performance date (base year) with which to compare current emissions. For its 2030 and 2040 GHG reduction targets, the OMV Group has set 2019 as the base year including full-year Scope 1 to 3 emissions data of Borealis. In accordance with best practice guidance (i.e., GHG Protocol), when a company undergoes significant structural changes due to acquisitions, divestments, and mergers, GHG data shall be recalculated for all years dating back to the base year. OMV has set a threshold that a significant change means that the cumulative effect of mergers/acquisitions/divestments represents a higher effect than 5% on the OMV Group's base year absolute GHG emissions. Accordingly, this table shows the recalculated emissions for the categories of emissions relevant for the 2030 targets. The previous table, GHG Emissions – Absolute, does not have recalculated data to give as transparent a picture as possible.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The following Scope 3 categories are included: Category 11: Use of Sold Products for OMV's energy segment, Category 1: Purchased Goods (feedstocks) from OMV's non-energy business segment, and Category 12: End-of-Life of Sold Products for OMV's non-energy segment.\n\n<sup>3</sup> The carbon intensity of energy supply is measured by assessing the intensity of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions plus Scope 3 emissions (in g CO2) from the use of sold energy products, against the total energy value of all externally sold energy products (in MJ) (excluding purely traded volumes).\n\n<sup>4</sup> The methane intensity refers to the volume of methane emissions from OMV's operated E&P oil and gas assets as a percentage of the volume of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. The approach is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI) methane intensity. Unlike the other figures in this table, the methane intensity is not subject to a baseline recalculation, as the target is a fixed value and the target achievement is not compared to the base year. In case of mergers and aquisitions, new operations will be expected to endorse the existing target.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n## GHG Emissions – Targets 2025<sup>1</sup>\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Unit                                 | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020   | 2019 | 2010 (baseline) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| GHG intensity of operations                                                                                            | OMV Group Carbon<br>Intensity Index2 | 80      | 83      | 82      | 82     | 80   | 100             |\n| Reduction achieved vs. 2010                                                                                            | %                                    | 20      | 17      | 18      | 18     | 20   | n.a.            |\n| GHG intensity of product portfolio                                                                                     | mn t GHG per mn t oil<br>equivalent  | 2.6     | 2.6     | 2.5     | 2.5    | 2.5  | 2.6             |\n| Achieve at least 1 mn t of CO2<br>reductions in<br>2020–2025 from operated assets (cumulative<br>reductions) (Scope 1) | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 703,146 | 644,946 | 532,907 | 77,900 | n.a. | n.a.            |\n| thereof from concrete reduction initiatives                                                                            | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 327,612 | 269,412 | 157,374 | 77,900 | n.a. | n.a.            |\n| thereof from divestments                                                                                               | t CO2<br>equivalent                  | 375,534 | 375,533 | 375,533 | 0.0    | n.a. | n.a.            |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Excluding Borealis\n\n<sup>2</sup> Direct CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent emissions produced to generate a certain business output using the following business-specific metric – Upstream: t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent/toe produced, refineries: t CO<sup>2</sup> equivalent/t throughput (crude and semi-finished products without blended volumes), power: t CO2 equivalent/MWh produced – consolidated into an OMV Group Carbon Intensity Index, based on weighted average of the business segments' carbon intensity.

Production was disrupted during the whole of 2023. Subsequently, ongoing projects have been paused and activities in the field reduced to maintenance, inspection, and preservation operations.

Additionally,<br>equipment to protect against the<br>hazard (e.g., PPE kits, on-site fire<br>department, etc.), safety manuals,<br>and signs are also made available. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                    |\n| 403-10      | Work-related ill health                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Requirement omitted:<br>403-10-a-i, ii, iii, 403-10-b-i, ii, iii,<br>403-10-c-i,ii,iii, 403-10-d, 403-10-e<br>Reason: Legal prohibitions<br>Explanation: In most of the countries<br>where OMV operates, the legal<br>definition of an \"occupational health<br>illness\" varies widely (Health is<br>excluded from the EU Maastricht<br>Treaty).

This is because we assign<br>target groups to training courses based<br>on risks, taking into consideration<br>affiliation to a certain business unit or<br>the type of activities performed rather<br>than specific regions or employee<br>categories. Due to the set-up of the<br>training courses over two-year cycles,<br>there is currently no plan to disclose this<br>in the foreseeable future. | 11.20.3

The Company applies the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB) and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") as reporting criteria. In addition, the company prepares disclosures in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which are published as part of sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for the selection and application of appropriate methods for non-financial reporting (especially the selection of significant matters) as well as the use of appropriate assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures, given\n\nthe circumstances. Furthermore, their responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of systems, processes and internal controls that are relevant for the preparation of the sustainability report in a way that is free of material misstatements – whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to state whether, based on our procedures performed and the evidence we have obtained, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company's NFI report is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB), the legal requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") in all material respects.\n\nOur engagement was conducted in conformity with Austrian Standards for Independent Assurance Engagements (KFS/PG 13) and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) applicable to such engagements. These standards require us to comply with our professional requirements including independence requirements, and to plan and perform the engagement to enable us to express a conclusion with limited assurance, taking into account materiality.\n\nAn independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with limited assurance (\"limited assurance engagement\") is substantially less in scope than an independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with reasonable assurance (\"reasonable assurance engagement\"), thus providing reduced assurance. Despite diligent engagement planning and execution, it cannot be ruled out that material misstatements, illegal acts or irregularities within the nonfinancial report will remain undetected.\n\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment and included the following procedures in particular:\n\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for the materiality analysis, in order to gain an understanding of the processes for determining material sustainability topics and respective reporting threshholds of the Company;\n- A risk assessment, including a media analysis, on relevant information on the Company's sustainability performance in the reporting period;\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/1 description: The image shows three blue icons in circles. The first icon is a printer. The second icon is a left arrow. The third icon is a right arrow.\n\n- Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of disclosures on environmental, social and employee-related matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption as well as bribery and also includes the consolidation of data;\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for providing, consolidating and implementing internal control procedures relating to the disclosure of concepts, risks, due diligence processes, results and performance indicators;\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents, in order to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;\n- Assessment of the processes for local data collection, validation and reporting, as well as the reliability of the reported data through a survey performed at sites on a sample basis;\n- Analytical evaluation of the data and trend of quantitative disclosures regarding the GRI Standards listed in the GRI-Index, submitted by all locations for consolidation at the group level;\n- Evaluation of the consistency of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§§ 243b and 267a UGB), the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the GRI Standards in its current version (option \"in accordance with\") to disclosures and indicators of the NFI report, which apply to the Company;\n- Evaluation of the overall presentation of the disclosures by critically reading the NFI report.\n\nThe procedures that we performed do not constitute an audit or a review. Our engagement did not focus on\n\nrevealing and clarifying of illegal acts (such as fraud), nor did it focus on assessing the efficiency of management. Furthermore, it is not part of our engagement to audit future-related disclosures, prior year figures, statements from external sources of information, expert opinions or references to more extensive external reporting formats of the Company.\n\n## Restriction on use\n\nBecause our report will be prepared solely on behalf of and for the benefit of the principal, its contents may not be relied upon by any third party, and consequently, we shall not be liable for any third party claims. We agree to the publication of our assurance certificate and NFI report. However, publication may only be performed in its entirety and as a version has been certified by us.\n\n## General Conditions of Contract\n\nOur responsibility and liability towards the Company and any third party is subject to paragraph 7 of the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions.\n\nVienna\n\n12 March 2024\n\nKPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\nMag.
