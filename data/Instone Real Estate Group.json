It mainly comprises all sales-related transactions, such as notarised real estate purchase agreements, individual orders from clients and rental income.\n\nVolume of sales contracts is also referred to as sales volume.\n\n#### Other important key performance indicators\n\nThe management of the Instone Group also uses the following KPIs for analysis and reporting:\n\n#### **Current offer for sale**\n\nThe current offer for sale is calculated on the basis of the unsold residential units in projects where sales have already started.\n\n#### **Project portfolio**\n\nThe project portfolio value as at the reporting date is the anticipated overall volume of revenue from all projects listed in the portfolio. The Instone Group divides its project portfolio into three different groups depending on the stage of development: For projects with the status \"presale\", the land has already been purchased, secured or claimed by us in a binding offer, but marketing has not yet begun. Following sales release and the initiation of marketing, projects are transferred to a \"pre-construction\" status. Projects with a completed start of construction have an \"under construction\" status until complete handover. Once structural obligations have been met and the entire sale<sup>1</sup> and full handover are complete, projects are removed from the project portfolio in the next reporting month.\n\n#### **Volume of new approvals**\n\nThe volume of new approvals reflects the Instone Group's success in acquiring new land and development projects. To secure the prospective cash outflows resulting from the approved investment, the project is included in our project portfolio from the date of approval. The internal approvals linked to the volume of new approvals are based on secured land access rights or such rights that have been verified by us with an offer involving a firm commitment. The volume of new approvals is measured by the volume of sales contracts expected at the time the new approval is granted.\n\n#### **Project gross profit and project gross profit margin**\n\nThe project gross profit consists of the project proceeds included in the adjusted revenue in the income statement over the project term, reduced by the relevant external project costs.\n\nThe relationship between the project gross profit and the total revenue proceeds of the project is used to calculate the project gross profit margin.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **Sustainability report**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Sustainability report (unaudited)**\n\n### **General principles and [requ](#page-286-0)irements** GRI 2-5\n\n#### Applied reporting standards\n\nIn this year's Sustainability Report, Instone Real Estate Group SE is voluntarily complying with the provisions of commercial law concerning non-financial reporting in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), although the Instone Group is not obliged to do so under the terms of the HGB because of the size of the Company. Additionally, this report discloses more than the minimum information required by law and is guided by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as well as their modified understanding of double materiality. This directive and these standards will become mandatory for the Instone Group for reporting starting in the financial year 2025. Since the Instone Group considers these developments to be important and instructive, it has aligned itself with these now-final European requirements, as it did in the previous year's report.\n\nAll sections of the text, tables and figures in the sustainability report which form part of the non-financial statement under the terms of the HGB and therefore are subject to a voluntary audit with limited assurance are indicated with the symbol .\n\nIn the context of the identification of key topics that are reported, the HGB and CSRD or ESRS (as of: 31 July 2023) differ with respect to their definition of double materiality.\n\nDouble materiality primarily consists of:\n\n1. Sustainability topics that are material to the performance, results and position of the business,\n\nand\n\n2. Effects of the business activities that have a material impact on the Company's environment.\n\nIn accordance with Section 289c (3) HGB, topics that are simultaneously material from both perspectives must be taken into consideration, while the CSRD/ESRS also take into consideration all those topics that are material only in one way.\n\nThe Instone Group has assessed all the relevant topics for double materiality. As defined in Section 289c (2) and (3) and Section 315c HGB, and taking into consideration the existing measures and requirements within the Group, no \"material risks\" have been identified in our own business activities or in connection with our business relationships, products and services, which \"very likely [have or will have] serious negative effects\" on the topics described in the materiality matri[x page54. F](#page-53-0)urther information can be found in the risk and opportunity report starting o[n page 156.](#page-155-0)\n\nIn addition, the Instone Group is likewise reporting in full in accordance with the final version of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (referred to below as the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the delegated acts adopted in this respect. The non-financial disclosures and key figures relating to our sustainability activities and the taxonomy reporting provided in this report and indicated with the symbol were subjected to an independent audit with limited assurance by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Dusseldorf, in accordance with the audit standards relevant to sustainability reporting (ISAE 3000 Revised).\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/18 description: The image shows a blue arrow pointing to the left.

The climate target was reviewed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) at the start of the financial year 2022. In addition, every identified action area has been assessed with regard to its contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe structure of the published information follows the specifications of the ESRS. All the information relates to the financial year 2023 up to the reporting date of 31 December 2023. In cases where the primary data was not available or was only partially available on the reporting date (for example, energy bills), extrapolations were made for the entire year on the basis of known data points. This has been documented accordingly.\n\nThe information covers all the companies included in the consolidated financial statements of Instone Real Estate Group SE as fully consolidated (see list of shareholdings annexed to the notes to the consolidated financial statement[s, page 255\\). A](#page-254-0)ll the information in this Sustainability Report is generally presented at Group level in accordance with the scope of consolidation which forms the basis of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report. Sustainability information is managed and recorded at Group level. It also includes central functions such as procurement, which is responsible for this area within the subsidiaries Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and Nyoo Real Estate GmbH.

reported over the life cycle according to the consolidated balance sheet group. The life cycle perspective does not allocate things to Scope 1, 2 or 3 and reports all emissions throughout the life cycle phases over a lifetime of 53 years. A distinction is made between operational carbon from the use phase and embedded carbon from the other phases (manufacture and dismantling).\n\n<sup>4</sup> Business-as-usual scenario \">– the emissions for electricity and district heating during the use phase were calculated here using a conservative approach, which envisages that the German energy sector will only pursue moderate decarbonisation (based on the study \"Energy projections and impact assessments 2030/2050\" by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, 2021).\n\n[TCFD metrics and

scenario assumptions were used to calculate the changes in material prices that are relevant for the Instone Group's business model. The most important materials were identified and allocated on the basis of an overview of the construction costs for each trade. The materials that were analysed made up a total of 70% of the construction costs, while the remainder was below the materiality threshold of 5%. Each trade's share of the total amount of costs was examined in the reporting year. Despite some changes in material prices, there were no significant changes in this respect. Risk ratings changed in a few cases due only to shifts in the trades' shares of the costs.\n\nThe results show that, in the 1.5°C scenario, the highest cost rises can be expected up to 2030 and up to 2050. In the 1.5°C scenario, this is due to the falling emission and energy intensity of the material manufacturing processes. This reduction in intensity from 2030 onwards can be achieved in the main by increases in efficiency, the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the introduction of green hydrogen into the manufacturing processes for steel, concrete and bricks.\n\nRising prices in the context of persistently high energy prices and the accompanying faster transition to renewable energies are the decisive reasons behind the very similar cost increase in the period up to 2030 in the 2.6°C scenario. By contrast, the lower cost increases up to 2050 are due to the fact that in the 2.6°C scenario after 2030, fewer restrictive regulations concerning emissions and energy will be adopted and so the rise in the price of CO₂ and energy will be small.\n\n| Revenue drivers  | Affected KPIs                          | Risk and opportunity assessment |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Growth in space  | Growth in living space<br>(apartments) | Opportunity                     |\n| Subsidies        | Subsidies                              | Low                             |\n| Passing on costs | Margins                                | Medium                          |\n| Sales prices     | Margins                                | Opportunity                     |\n\nThe trade most affected by transition risks is shell construction. This is due partly to the predominant use of materials with a high emission and energy intensity, such as steel and concrete, and partly to the large proportion of the construction costs that they represent, which is around 31%.\n\nAlthough chains of climate risks and opportunities were identified on the **revenue side**, they could not be quantified in a comparable way because of the lack of assumptions in the scenarios. With regard to the possibility of passing on cost increases, rises in the sales prices of energy-efficient buildings or subsidies for sustainable building, studies and articles from publicly available sources were analysed and compared with internal information to produce a qualitative assessment of the results. On the revenue side, no differences were identified between the two climate scenarios.\n\nThe qualitative assessment of the revenue highlights two opportunities in particular. There are no obstacles to the corporate growth strategy even from the perspective of the 1.5°C scenario, as there will continue to be a need for more new apartment buildings. Another opportunity lies in the fact that the Instone Group already builds highly carbon- and energy-efficient buildings which initial studies, for example by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), show could potentially reach higher prices than conventional buildings.\n\nThe changing subsidy situation represents a minor risk. Grants are drying up, though these amount to only a small, single-digit percentage of revenue. Funding in the form of \"Climate-friendly new construction\" (KFN) funds benefit the Instone Group's clients, meaning it has no impact on our own subsidy situation. However, these grants have come to an end as applications for the KfW Federal Funding for Efficient Buildings scheme stopped being accepted on 14 December 2023.\n\nThe possible reduction in the option of passing on costs was categorised as a moderate risk. A comparison of historic data relating to construction prices and sale prices of new apartment blocks shows a slight fall in the trend for passing on price increases since 2021. Therefore, it is not possible to predict how this situation will develop. However, it is an important factor in assessing whether the forecast increases in the construction costs of buildings could become a risk for the Instone Group. The Instone Group will monitor this development at regular intervals in order to identify measures at an early stage.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn summary, the Instone Group uses the climate scenario analysis methodology for proactive transition management and for taking targeted measures at the right moment in the event of increased risks. However, the current analysis indicates that the Instone Group's business model is resilient to climate risks.\n\n**Physical climate risks** were also analysed in the financial year 2023 using Munich Re's Climate Risk Assessment Suite. All portfolio projects under construction and completed in the calendar year were analysed and all projects with high climate risks were required to make adjustments.\n\nfigure 011 shows the geographical distribution of different risks of the taxonomy-enabled properties in accordance with the consolidated accounting group with regard to the Munich Re climate risk assessment. High risks are expected for three projects in three different locations. Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia each have a project with an increased risk. Hamburg in particular is at risk from flooding and tornadoes. The locations in Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia have an increased risk from hail and tornadoes. Of the 23 projects surveyed, three projects (13%) have a high risk of at least two hazards. Countermeasures were included in the planning stage.\n\nThese measures were implemented in 2023. Other measures for managing high risks associated with certain physical hazards will be continually reviewed and implemented over the coming years.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/20 description: This image is a map of Germany from the \"Excerpt from the physical climate scenario analysis 2023 FIGURE 011\".

The achievement of sustainability in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation for buildings underpins the Instone Group's aim to demonstrate effective measures against environmental pollution and meet high standards.\n\nThe increased attractiveness of the projects is expected to have a positive impact on various interest groups, particularly clients, investors, financial institutions and employees. Measures against sources of pollution have been re-examined and modified as needed in order to minimise or completely eliminate the environmental pollution caused by each project. We will make sure that these efforts are successful by conducting structured and regular surveys of air, water and soil quality at all project locations in the future.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity perspective**\n\n[TCFD strategy](#page-289-0)\n\nIf there should be an environmental pollution incident that involves the law being broken, there is a risk of financial penalties, costs for rectifying the environmental damage and financial losses resulting from possible damage to the Company's image. The likelihood of such an incident is considered low because contractual regulations and the selection process for contractual partners are designed to ensure that we only do business with partners who at least always meet legal requirements. There is also the possibility that measures to prevent environmental pollution may need to be strengthened in order to meet both today's and tomorrow's regulations and to ensure projects are taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThese considerations also include potentially positive financial impacts and opportunities.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Water consumption and management ( )**\n\n**MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/18 description: The image shows the text \"E10 Water consumption and management\".\n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\n\"Water consumption and management\" (E10), including the protection of water resources, are part of the Instone Group's sustainability strategy and have double materiality as shown by the results of the materiality analysis.\n\nA physical climate risk analysis is used to monitor the extent to which increasing climate change is affecting water resources (see also the section \"Climate change\").\n\nIn addition, the Instone Group analysed water consumption and management, which include the protection of water resources, as part of a due diligence process in the financial year 2022. The causes of high water consumption and the risk of contaminating water in the context of our business activities are the result of:\n\n- existing pollution/contamination of the groundwater before the purchase of land,\n- water consumption on the construction site,\n- water consumption in the use phase of the building\n- discharge of waste water on the construction site,\n- Protection of bodies of water surrounding construction sites and new buildings.1\n\nThe financial year 2023 also saw a subgroup on \"Neighbourhood water management\" created as part of the \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group. This subgroup focuses mainly on solutions that can help promote the natural water cycle and reduce water consumption within neighbourhoods. In this context, the national water strategy was examined along with duties and requirements under legislation (the Water Framework Directive, the Federal Water Act etc.) and municipal codes. In addition, water management requirements based on various certification systems (such as from the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB)) were examined in detail. This information is used to derive potential measures and implement them for future project developments. For new projects, a checklist is available as a guide for the implementation of water management measures. A collection of best practices provides ideas and suggestions for practical implementation.\n\nThe target for \"Water consumption and management\" was to meet the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation for each topic<sup>2</sup> in at least 90% of all Instone Group projects concerned (buildings with commercial use). [TCFD metrics and targets](#page-289-0) [GRI 303, 303-1, 303-2, 303-3](#page-287-0)\n\nAs the Instone Group only develops properties in urban areas and therefore only comes into contact with marine resources indirectly via rivers flowing into the sea, these have been omitted from the package of measures.\n\n- <sup>2</sup> The Taxonomy Regulation specifies for the economic activity \"Construction of buildings\" (NACE: 41) in the action area \"Water\" the following \"do no significant harm\" (DNSH) criteria:\n- Specific water efficiency levels for sanitary facilities on commercial sites\n- Water on the construction site: Identifying and, if necessary, remedying the risks of environmental damage relating to the maintenance of water quality and the avoidance of water shortages\n- If not already covered by an environmental impact assessment: Preparation of a management plan for water use and the protection of bodies of water that may be affected.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Water consumption and management measures TABLE 010**\n\nTABLE 010\n\n| To our shareholders        | Material topic                   | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Degree of implementation1 |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Combined management report | Water consumption and management | Modification of bills of quantities for contractual partners to include the installation of sanitary facilities that meet the maximum flow rates of sanitary equipment such as sinks, showers, toilets and urinals2 (especially commercial) as well as water-saving sanitary facilities | In progress               |\n|                            |                                  | Establishment of a standardised process to record water consumption on construction sites in order to develop meaningful and measurable reduction measures                                                                                                                              | In progress               |\n| Foundations of the Group   |                                  | Inclusion of water-saving potential in accordance with the package of measures for sustainable and responsible water use in project and product development                                                                                                                             | In progress               |\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure; 2) In progress: Work is already proceeding to implement the measure; 3) Implemented: The measure has already been included in standard processes, e.g. in guidelines and work equipment.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The maximum flow rates are specified in accordance with the DNSH criterion of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for new builds.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Impact perspective**\n\nDue diligence showed that only a few measures relating to the protection of water resources as part of water management have been integrated into business processes to date. In this context and as part of the documentation requirements for the taxonomy audit, we have begun actively addressing the topic of water in our standard project development process. This ensures that measures for resource-conscious and sustainable water use are included early in the planning process.\n\nFor buildings with commercial units containing efficient sanitary equipment that complies with the EU taxonomy flow rates, the target of 90% was met in the financial year. This is the result of anticipatory planning and implementation as well as the replacement of equipment in some commercial units, among other measures.\n\nThe working group focussing on water use within neighbourhoods has already developed a package of measures designed to reduce water consumption during the use phase and have a positive impact in terms of groundwater levels and flood prevention in the case of torrential rain. The increased use of green spaces, for example, is not only conducive to the neighbourhood's micro-climate: The increased infiltration of storm water also supports the groundwater level and helps prevent flooding from torrential rain. More specific instruments, such as infiltration basins and tree trenches, can amplify these effects.\n\nIn terms of the building itself, green spaces or green façades can help regulate groundwater levels and prevent flooding from torrential rain whilst also offering additional benefits such as better insulation against heat and cold.\n\nThe \"Schönhof-Viertel\" in Frankfurt am Main is a good example of the water management measures that have already been planned and implemented. In this project, rainwater collected on the paved public areas is partly channelled through intermediate rigoles into rainwater wells in the public park. The rainwater collects there, seeps down through cleaning layers, is collected in the rainwater channel and ultimately conducted into an adjacent watercourse. On other plots, accumulated storm water is collected on green roofs or in trenches, then slowly conveyed into the storm water drainage channel.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity perspective** [TCFD strategy](#page-289-0)\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nAlthough the financial risk, for example, from the cost of water, may only be material in nature in the short to medium term (in the form of manufacturing costs), climate scenarios show the effects of increasing climate change, which include droughts and a fall in the groundwater table. In the medium to long term, the Instone Group estimates that local costs will rise if water temporarily becomes a rare commodity in some areas of Germany because of climate change. The drivers of cost increases could include rising water prices, higher costs of procurement and transport and possibly also additional costs caused by slower construction work in the event of bottlenecks.\n\nThe \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group continuously monitors and evaluates water-related developments. Specific financial costs or risks resulting from selected measures (see \"Impact perspective\") for projects are assessed as soon as the appropriate information is available.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **[Biodiversity \\( \\)](#page-287-0)**\n\nGRI 304, 304-2, 304-3, 304-4\n\n#### **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nE2 Biodiversity\n\nE9 Brownfield developments\n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nAlongside climate change mitigation, biodiversity is gaining more and more attention in political, scientific and economic circles at both a national and international level. Biodiversity makes a central contribution to climate protection and adaptation to the consequences of climate change. Consequences of climate change are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, while this plays a central role as natural GHG storage. One example of increasing regulations in this area is the CSRD's disclosure requirements along with the associated ESRS, which address the topic \"Biodiversity and ecosystems\" in ESRS E4. Additionally, these requirements are mandatory for all sectors defined by the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) as \"priority sectors\". These include construction and building materials. This therefore includes the Instone Group.\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/24 description: The image shows the logo for the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The logo consists of a square divided into four smaller squares, with the letters T, N, F, and D in each square, respectively. To the right of the square is the text \"Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures\".\n\nThe TNFD is a market-oriented, government-\nsupported initiative that gives companies\nscience-based recommendations for responding\nto current and future nature-related problems.\nVarious committees of policy-makers, business-\npeople and scientists develop recommendations\nand guidelines to address and report on biodiversity\nrisks. The TNFD's recommendations primarily\nrelate to reportable structures, processes,\nmeasures, targets and key figures concerning\nnature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and\nopportunities.\n\nFor the overarching topic of biodiversity protection, a topic-specific due diligence review was carried out in the financial year 2022 to analyse where the highest risks of endangering biodiversity lie as posed by business activities. These risks still apply and have been augmented in the financial year 2023 by a pilot analysis based on TNFD recommendations:\n\n- Projects on land where endangered species live (can also concern brownfield projects),\n- Projects on land where non-endangered species live (can also concern brownfield projects),\n- Greenfield projects, especially on land with particularly high biodiversity,\n- Surface sealing,\n- All projects in the immediate or close vicinity of areas with high biodiversity and conservation areas.\n\nLikewise, we reviewed which precautions, regulations and measures have already been implemented to preserve biodiversity and whether there is a need for additional action.

The analysis was used\nto define relevant site-, sector-and Instone Group-specific\naspects for each impact and each risk, and to determine\nfor these aspects potential targets, the measures to\nachieve these targets and metrics to monitor them. It also\nshowed where appropriate procedures could be integrated\ninto existing processes and where new processes need to\nbe defined. The results of the TNFD pilot are being used to\nspecify biodiversity-related measures and their implemen-\ntation and to refine measures from the annual report 2022.\nThese relate in particular to:\n\n- \n- \n\nImage /page/87/Figure/22 description: The image shows a numbered list of steps.

To identify the relevant impact and risks of a site that need to be addressed, select project sites were included in the TNFD pilot analysis (see \"step 3\" in figure above). This was done using the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter tool. The analysis produced an overview and assessment of potential risks to nature and biodiversity:\n\n#### **Potential project-specific risks to nature and biodiversity (excerpt from overall analysis)**\n\nEffects associated with a high risk are \"Change in land, water and marine use\", \"Loss of tree population\", \"Pollution\" and \"Protected areas\", meaning that these effects could pose both risks in relation to the environment and financial risks. Site-specific dependencies with high risk include forest productivity, water condition and media criticism. In particular, the subject areas in which mismanagement would have financial consequences for the Instone Group exhibit dependencies.\n\n**FIGURE 013**\n\n| ities report      |

information](#page-285-0)**\n\n• Firstly, actively shaping biodiversity at project level brings with it both financial risks and opportunities. For example, raising biodiversity standards as part of construction projects affects their implementation costs. In particular, the biodiversity-friendly design of green roofs and other areas on the plots to be used for construction land lead to an increase in costs. In addition, competing for space, i.e. the trade-off between leaving more space available than required by law and designing accordingly or the trade-off of including as much residential space as possible in the project or on the construction land, has an impact on the revenue achievable for the Instone Group.\n\n• Secondly, dependencies on natural resources have a financial impact. For this purpose, the analysis with the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter provides location-specific information. This enables the Instone Group to more detail the effects of potential risks on the company, development projects in particular and thus qualitatively also on financial performance.\n\nThe results of the TNFD pilot analysis are used to perform a detailed review of the identified risks so that the responsible operational working group can develop appropriate measures and processes.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Consumption of natural resources and recycling ( )**\n\n[GRI 301, 301-1, 301-2, 301-3, 306, 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4](#page-287-0)\n\n#### **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nConsumption of natural resources/recycling\n\nChoice of building materials\n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nThe effective use of resources and the transition to a circular economy are part of the Instone Group's sustainability strategy. The materiality analysis showed that \"Consumption of natural resources/recycling\" (E1) and \"Choice of building materials\" (E6), i.e. the use of environmentally friendly materials, have double materiality for the Instone Group. A key indicator of this is not least the fact that around 28% of the Instone Group's total carbon footprint1 comes from the manufacturing phase of our buildings. The gradual switch to recycled, reusable and reused building materials, such as recycled concrete or lumber, is therefore an important lever in achieving our climate targets.\n\nAs for the other environmental aspects, the Instone Group also analysed this topic in a due diligence review in the financial year 2022 to identify where the biggest potential for the optimal use of resources and circular economy lies within the scope of our business activities. In the financial year 2023, the following topics in particular were examined more closely:\n\n- Reduction in the use of carbon-intensive building materials (e.g. concrete, steel) through resource-optimised design\n- Increase in the proportion of building materials made of renewable raw materials (e.g. wood)\n- Increase in the proportion of recycled, reusable and reused building materials\n\nIn Germany, as much non-hazardous waste and rubble as possible is already sent for recycling or reuse under the Circular Economy Act (KrWG). Nevertheless, this topic and the provision of corresponding evidence have been included in the supplemental agreement on disposal (through purchase).\n\nThe target for \"Consumption of natural resources and recycling\" is firstly to meet the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation for each topic2 for all Instone Group projects by complying with legal obligations. Our target is also to make a significant contribution to carbon reduction by using sustainable building materials and reducing the use of materials in general as well as implementing this target in economically viable solutions. [TCFD metrics and targets](#page-289-0)\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Impact perspective**\n\nThe particular importance of this topic to the Instone Group is reflected in the creation of two working groups (\"Sustainable building\" and \"Hybrid timber\"), which work closely on measures relating to this area. These working groups identify potential for optimisation and develop concrete approaches for practical implementation.\n\n1 Includes Instone Real Estate Group SE Scopes 1, 2 and 3\n\n- 2 The Taxonomy Regulation specifies for the economic activity \"Construction of buildings\" (NACE: 41) the following DNSH criteria in the action area of circular economy:\n- \n- At least 70% of non-hazardous rubble/waste and demolition is sent for reuse or recycling. • Observance of best practices for the handling of hazardous substances and sorting of materials.\n- The design of the buildings and the construction techniques support the circular economy.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe \"Sustainable building\" working group focuses on assessing and classifying building materials and products with regard to material sustainability aspects such as carbon reduction, ingredients, supply chains and demolition. With the help of a building product matrix, the key building materials have been identified and specific alternative products named. Examples include eco-friendly limestone and low-carbon concrete. Solutions to reduce material use, for example through structural optimisation measures, as well as recommendations for sustainable building are also being developed.\n\nThe \"Hybrid timber\" working group specifically investigates the extent to which embodied carbon can be reduced by substituting structural components with timber solutions. As part of this research, the group conducted an LCA variant comparison1 using a specific example in order to calculate various designs (solid construction (standard), frame construction and 100% timber construction) and compare them with one another. This analysis not only included global warming potential and non-renewable primary energy but also specific considerations in relation to building costs and potential for the living space and construction time.\n\nWe are currently reviewing the gradual implementation into practice and further development of the interim results to determine their applicability to Instone Group projects. In addition, we constantly monitor technological progress with a view to modifying building materials and continuously review implementation options to ensure that we achieve our climate neutrality target.\n\n1 \"LCA\" stands for life cycle assessment.

This is due on the one hand to the volatility of prices for conventional as well as natural building materials, and on the other hand to the fact that products made from recycled, reusable or natural raw materials are not available on the market in sufficient quantities, if at all. Resource-optimised designs can help further reduce the use of carbonintensive building materials in the future and save on costs.\n\nIn some cases, the right technology does not yet exist, such as for cement, to fully realise effective resource use and the transition to a circular economy. Based on the findings of the Climate-Neutral Germany 2045 study1 , the Instone Group does not expect to have access to a low-emission product until the early 2030s at the earliest. The \"Sustainable building\" working group continually monitors developments and examines them for feasibility. Currently, there is no data available to collect.

Accordingly, the Instone Group is not required to submit any report on EU taxonomy this reporting year, although it has voluntarily disclosed its activities under the applicable Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nUnder Article 8 (1) and (2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, companies are required to disclose their taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned revenue, CapEx and OpEx. This requirement is substantiated by delegated acts both in content (Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and adaptation; Complementary Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and adaptation; Complementary Delegated Act to determine sustainable activities for the environmental objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) and formally (Delegated Act on Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, including corresponding annexes; Delegated Act on disclosure requirements and amendments thereto in complementary delegated acts).\n\nPotential taxonomy-eligible revenue, as well as CapEx and OpEx, fall below the defined materiality threshold of 3%. The Instone Group's interpretation is that information is only to be included if it is necessary for an understanding of business operations, situation and anticipated development. This is in line with the interpretation of the Accounting Standards Committee of Germany (ASCG) in its submission to the European Commission on various issues related to the application of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation of 7 December 2021.\n\nIn order to determine the relevance of the activities and related revenue, as well as CapEx and OpEx, to the Instone Group, it was necessary when preparing this report to evaluate the taxonomy disclosure of the Instone Group with regard to these three items, revenue, CapEx and OpEx, as follows:\n\na. Revenue from project development is recognised in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group mainly using the \"revenue recognition over time\" method in accordance with IFRS 15. However, some of the technical screening criteria (e.g. \"blower door test\") and the DNSH criteria can only be finally tested/documented after a new building is completed.\n\nIn order to present taxonomy-aligned revenue for the appropriate period and also to position it in relation to the total annual revenue and thus develop a meaningful statement on the matter, it is essential to define criteria that indicate taxonomy alignment even before the completion of construction and when the revenue is recognised according to the \"revenue recognition over time\" method. In this respect, too, the recognition of revenue over time is congruent with the taxonomy assessment and already assumes the contractual fulfilment of the specification before final inspection once construction is complete.\n\nb. In the IFRS consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group, capital expenditure therefore comprises, according to Annex I to the Delegated Act on Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the costs accounted for based on the following standards:\n\na) IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraph 73 (e) (i) and (iii)\n\nb) IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118 (e) (i)\n\nc) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 76 (a) and (b) (for the fair value model)\n\nd) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79 (d) (i) and (ii) (for the cost model)\n\ne) IAS 41 Agriculture, paragraph 50 (b) and (e)\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### f) IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53 (h)\n\nOnly non-significant balance sheet items fall under this definition at the Instone Group. This is due to the nature of the business model. Intangible assets and right of use assets that are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 and IFRS 16 and thus fall under the taxonomy-aligned categories mentioned account for less than 1% of the Instone Group's total assets and are therefore immaterial in terms of their informative value for the taxonomy-enabled or taxonomy-aligned reporting on the business model of the Instone Group under the activity \"Construction of new buildings\".\n\nc. In the taxonomy, OpEx refers to direct, non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building refurbishment, short-term leasing, maintenance and repair, and all other direct expenses related to the dayto-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment by the Company or third parties to whom activities are outsourced which are necessary to ensure the continuous and effective functioning of these assets. This OpEx must be related to activities that are taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe EU taxonomy requires the introduction of an operational process for reviewing and checking the taxonomy criteria. Under the Taxonomy Regulation, an activity is considered to taxonomy-aligned if it makes a significant contribution to at least one of a total of six environmental objectives without running counter to the others (DNSH). Minimum requirements must also be met. The taxonomy's environmental objectives are: (1) Climate change mitigation, (2) Climate change adaptation, (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) Transition to a circular economy, (5) Pollution prevention and control, and (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe business model of the Instone Group is to develop residential properties. This is a taxonomy-eligible activity, \"Construction of new buildings\", for which there are technical screening criteria on the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as DNSH criteria in order to assess a potential alignment. With the publication of the final version of the Environmental Delegated Act on environmental objectives 3–6 (22 November 2023), the activity \"Construction of new buildings\" also falls under the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy\". With the activity \"Construction of new buildings\", Instone Real Estate Group SE is currently making a significant contribution to 1) Climate change mitigation, since 100% of projects are already examined for their contribution to this environmental objective and climate change mitigation is the Company's strategic priority. The Instone Group identified this\n\nrelationship in its operational review of projects, since the environmental objective of climate change mitigation is directly applicable through the technical screening criteria and can be influenced in all Instone Group projects. Another possible criterion aside from (1) Climate change mitigation is environmental objective (2) Climate change adaptation, which also includes the construction of new buildings as a taxonomy-eligible activity. Following the publication of the Delegated Act on environmental objectives 3–6 in 2023, the Instone Group's activity \"Construction of new buildings\" also falls under environmental objective (4) Transition to a circular economy. On the basis of a renewed review of all environmental targets and their fulfilment criteria for the new construction business activity, it was also determined in the year under review that the economic activity of the Instone Group can still be assigned to the environmental objective of climate protection. This means that the activities of the Instone Group are not examined in relation to any other environmental objectives.\n\nUnder the environmental objective (1) Climate change mitigation, the derived technical screening criteria are the energy efficiency (primary energy demand) of the new building (exceeding the national NZEB requirements established in the German Building Energy Act of 2021 by at least 10%), air-tightness and thermal integrity. Where the total area exceeds 5,000 m2, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are also recorded. In addition, the specific DNSH criteria for the environmental objectives of (2) Climate change adaptation, (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) Transition to a circular economy, (5) Pollution prevention and control, and (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems are also checked.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe DNSH criteria are checked as follows:\n\n- (2) Climate change adaptation: Physical climate risk analysis based on a building life of about 55 years and summary of the analysis (list of hazards with high risk, time and climate scenario). For buildings with high risk: Summary of planned measures.\n- (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: proof of water efficiency for commercial spaces in the tender and product description of sanitary facilities. Further proof is supplied from notifications of water rights and statements from the competent water authorities.\n- (4) Transition to a new circular economy: binding agreement with contractual partners to comply with Section 14 (2) KrWG as well as with the annotations in the EU's Draft Commission Notice of 19 December 2022 and to consider standard building elements in accordance with DGNB TEC 1.6. The corresponding supplemental agreement was revised and amended in November 2023.\n- (5) Avoidance and reduction of environmental pollution: binding agreement with contractual partners to avoid the use of toxic building materials and proof using material data sheets. Investigation of the land, compilation of soil surveys and documentation of any necessary measures.\n\n• (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: proof using, for example, wildlife surveys for flora and fauna as well as key fertility figures for arable land.\n\nThe Instone Group has made the necessary adjustments to existing processes and added responsibilities, for example, data collection and analysis, determination of taxonomy eligibility and alignment, and accounting classification, to existing internal or process descriptions, such as the accounting guidelines and project documentation guidelines, in accordance with the technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria and process descriptions.\n\nTo assess taxonomy alignment, the Instone Group uses a standardised taxonomy form containing the relevant technical screening criteria along with information on where to find proof and the result of the assessment. The implementation of the assessment process at the building level is led by the Sustainability department in coordination with project managers in the individual branches. The Finance department is responsible for implementation at the accounting level.\n\nThe EU taxonomy requirements for minimum safeguards and the associated review of the\n\n- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,\n- UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and\n- International Convention on Human Rights with related due diligence\n\nare covered by the Instone Group through its generally implemented process for reviewing directives, work materials/resources and policies at Group level. This also includes compliance with legal regulations, statements on addressing human rights, for example via the Code of Conduct for employees and contractual partners, occupational health and safety, the environment, combating bribery and corruption, and taxes, for example via corporate policies. The review is conducted on a regular basis and is coordinated between the responsible Legal Department and the responsible departments at Group level, and is broken down into the subsidiaries if necessary.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### EU taxonomy and strategic relevance\n\nThe Instone Group is pursuing the strategic goal of reviewing all new projects for alignment with the EU Taxonomy Regulation environmental objective of climate change mitigation. In the 2023 financial year, a rate of 90.0% (previous year: 86.7%) of the project revenues can be achieved as being in line with the taxonomy. In 2023, all projects and subprojects relevant to revenue were analysed. Likewise, 152 of the 167 (previous year: 167 of 191) buildings relevant to revenue achieved taxonomy alignment. There was an improvement in this rate because planning for some projects was adjusted in favour of a taxonomy-aligned construction method. The organisation's increased awareness of the strategic relevance of this topic showed immediate positive effects in this regard. Additionally, some projects had the final energy performance certificates issued in the planning stage, meaning these projects now also meet the taxonomy requirements and increase the rate further.\n\n| Taxonomy buildings                            |                           | TABLE 014                |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Sales-relevant properties in<br>2022 and 2023 | 2022                      | 2023                     |\n| Taxonomy-eligible                             | 191 buildings             | 167 buildings            |\n| Taxonomy-aligned                              | 167 buildings<br>(87.4%)1 | 152 buildings<br>(91.0%) |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Correction to previous year due to recording error.\n\n#### Reporting forms in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU Tax Regulation)\n\nReporting of the EU taxonomy figures is done in tabular form using specified reporting forms.

are material for the Instone Group from the impact perspective. Employees plan and implement projects, develop innovations and drive transformation. They work to solve the following key challenges:\n\n- creating sufficient and affordable housing,\n- further developing environmentally sustainable and climatefriendly construction methods,\n- designing neighbourhoods in German urban areas that are worth living in.\n\nThe topic of employee diversity is of particular relevance to the Instone Group (double materiality). Employee diversity is a core element of the ideals of the Instone Group. The organisation is made up of lots of different people (age, gender, ethnic origin etc.) who significantly shape the diversity of the Instone Group. The personality of every single individual is extremely important. However, a good work-life balance, occupational health and safety, fair pay and good working conditions are also essential to achieve a high level of employee satisfaction.\n\nAll topics relating to employees and their concerns are the responsibility of the HR Department and are clarified with the responsible Chief Human Resources Officer, Andreas Gräf, and where co-determination law is concerned, with the works council.

Responsibility is firmly rooted in our corporate culture and therefore in the Group's day-to-day business. As a company, the Instone Group wishes to establish a successful long-term collaboration with cities and communities whilst also demonstrating its social responsibility to people and the environment. In many projects, the Instone Group is not only the residential developer but also the neighbourhood developer – we design living space.\n\nThe concept of \"social impact development\" has become increasingly important. Project developers like the Instone Group are strengthening collaboration with urban planners and urban development policy, initiatives, NGOs, cooperatives and civil society. This means that neighbourhoods can be developed sustainably with existing structures being optimised instead of replaced. Urban development driven by social impact can be described as a discipline of urban planning that involves all stakeholders to a greater degree. Taking into account ESG, EU taxonomy and certification requirements, the Instone Group is a trusted partner for all the different stakeholders in the neighbourhood. Under \"social impact\", the Instone Group combines the impact on the neighbourhood (\"neighbourhood impact\") and the construction of (affordable) housing.\n\nThe challenge of designing living space lies in the fact that current planning must reflect the state of the art for development, energy supply, mobility, neighbourhood needs, local recreation and the environment 20 years from now and beyond in order to create an attractive living environment for all residents over the long term. As a neighbourhood developer, the Instone Group feels it has an obligation to offer residents and the area surrounding the neighbourhoods a positive \"neighbourhood impact\" whilst also supplying urgently needed housing.\n\nThe supply of affordable housing in Germany's metropolitan areas is one of the greatest challenges of our times. In Germany, hundreds of thousands of homes are lacking – and the trend is rising. Forecasts for 2025 are estimated at 700,000 missing housing units.<sup>1</sup> Current demand is not being met and the situation is deteriorating with every passing year. Despite the population in Germany increasing by 1.1 million people in the past year, residential building permits fell 28.5% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. 2 This increases rents and sale prices to such an extent that people in many income groups can no longer afford to buy residential property. Many rent-controlled homes are also coming to the end of their rent control period. This means that more homes are losing the protection of rent control than are being built each year.<sup>3</sup> The number of subsidised units decreased from around 2.1 million to 1.1 million from 2006 to 2022<sup>4</sup>, and has therefore nearly halved. As a result, the supply of affordable housing in metropolitan areas is coming under ever-increasing pressure, and this situation will be further exacerbated by current inflation trends as well as higher interest rates, building costs and energy prices.\n\n<sup>4</sup> Statista, 2023: https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/892789/umfrage/sozialwohnungen-in-deutschland/\n\n<sup>1</sup> ZIA, 2023: \"Konzentrierte Aktion Wohnen: Was es jetzt braucht, um den Wohnungsbau endlich wieder anzukurbeln\" [Concerted action: housing – what it will take to get residential construction going again]. https://zia-deutschland.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/zia\\_positionen\\_aktion\\_wohnen\\_2023\\_Druckversion.pdf (German only)\n\n<sup>2</sup> bulwiengesa, 2023: \"Die 5%-Studie – wo investieren sich noch lohnt\" [The 5% study – where is investing worth it?]. https://bulwiengesa.de/sites/default/files/2023-09/5\\_prozent\\_studie\\_2023\\_deutsch.pdf (German only) <sup>3</sup> bulwiengesa, 2023: https://bulwiengesa.de/de/magazin/doppelter-sinn-gefoerdertes-wohnen-als-investment\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n- **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nA rethink by all those involved in a project development, such as administrations, politicians, project developers and investors, is therefore required in order to build even the 400,000 new homes per year called for by the German Federal Government. Among other things, this requires that approval processes be reduced, support policies standardised and the standards situation and building legislation considerably simplified. The long-term planning security that would result from these political and legal adjustments would improve investor confidence and allow project developers to plan cost-effectively and with confidence. In this context, the Instone Group has defined affordable housing as a topic with double materiality.\n\nAs such, the supply of affordable yet sustainable and liveable housing is one of the most pressing social issues of this time if the current shortfall is to be made up. As a project developer, the Instone Group is aware of its responsibility and, despite the tense market situation, is making an important contribution to meeting the housing demand in Germany with the construction of its residential housing projects. This includes both the creation of housing in general and the supply of affordable housing for a large target group in particular. The Instone Group is achieving this by constructing subsidised and price-controlled housing whilst also, with the cost-optimised residential concept of its subsidiary nyoo, pursuing the goal of affordable building and affordable housing through mass-production planning and standardised production.\n\nThe management of material topics in this action area is primarily the responsibility of the managers at Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. As part of a due diligence process, they assume responsibility for planning and implementing material topics in the area of \"Cities and communities\" and, if necessary, come to an agreement with the Sustainability Department and committee in accordance with the governance concept. In addition, a permanent working group focussed on this topic is developing implementation ides for sustainable neighbourhood development and using those ideas to develop concrete measures for future projects.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cities and communities measures TABLE 018**\n\n|                               | Material topic                   | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Degree of<br>implementation |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| To our shareholders           |                                  | Review of higher-level certifications (e.g. serial certification for the nyoo planning toolbox)                                                                                                                                                             | In progress                 |\n| Combined<br>management report |                                  | Specialist lectures at subject-specific events, municipalities, municipal associations<br>(such as Deutscher Städtetag (an association representing German cities and towns)) to<br>demonstrate the added value of the Instone Group and nyoo in all phases | Implemented                 |\n| Foundations of the Group      | Affordable housing               | Evaluation of funding opportunities                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | In progress                 |\n|                               |                                  | Initiation and hosting of curated events together with leading industry associations<br>to sustainably increase the innovative power of the industry/mass-production building                                                                               | In progress                 |\n| Sustainability report         |                                  | Evaluation of strategic partnerships in portfolio holding                                                                                                                                                                                                   | In progress                 |\n| Economic report               | Development of<br>neighbourhoods | Social impact guide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Implemented                 |\n|                               | neighbourhoods                   | Social impact scoring model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | In progress                 |\n|                               | Social commitment                | Development of a participation process guide                                                                                                                                                                                                                | In progress                 |\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure;

The Instone Group ensures an optimised project workflow in particular by taking the lean management approach using the \"beeboard\" software.\n\nThe construction of urgently needed affordable housing is a primary concern. The Instone Group defines affordable housing as all units that are subsidised or enter the market at a pre-set price. The Instone Group also includes all units built based on the cost-optimised nyoo concept. Our goal is to have at least 50% of our residential units be categorised as affordable housing by 2030 (see table of targets o[n page 68\\) a](#page-67-0)nd, until then, to steadily increase the proportion of this kind of housing in our overall portfolio.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Instone Group is taking two approaches: The first approach is to review at the start of every project how many subsidised and price-controlled units can and must be constructed. The development plan frequently specifies a minimum percentage of the total volume or, for new development plans, the Instone Group speaks directly to the appropriate city or local authority. The funding terms can also vary between federal states, cities and local authorities. On this basis, the Instone Group is evaluating economically viable solutions. Responsibility lies with the respective operating subsidiary. The second approach is to accomplish the goal specifically by increasing nyoo's project portfolio.\n\nThis approach is based on the \"nyoo concept\". nyoo has set a goal of using serial planning and production to build more affordably. By consistently standardising and optimising the entire project development and building process, nyoo is able to keep manufacturing costs low. At the heart of this conceptual approach is digitalisation and standardisation on three levels: product, process and production. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of planners, architects, project developers, project managers and office management staff covers the majority of the value chain with its work. This mass-production concept delivers better efficiency and cost savings: Interfaces to external planners can be reduced and production costs and project run times can be minimised. Resources of all kinds are optimally used.\n\nThe success of the nyoo concept is demonstrated not only by the first projects completed using this approach but also by initial success in urban planning competitions. The \"DUS 19\" project in Dusseldorf-Unterbach, with a total of 80% subsidised housing, and \"DUI 76\" in Duisburg-Buchholz were both completed in the middle of 2023 and have been successfully handed over to the long-term portfolio holders. The \"DUI 06\" project in Duisburg-Wedau is still in the planning phase. In North Rhine-Westphalia's largest urban development project to date, \"6-Seen-Wedau\", the nyoo concept won over the jury in the concept tendering procedure and was awarded two plots with the potential for around 185 residential units in 2022. Over the coming years, nyoo will develop more than 1,000 residential units in total, including the project in Duisburg – a significant contribution to increasing affordable housing.\n\nNormally, nyoo undertakes project development for institutional clients as well as private and municipal housing companies using a trading development model.1 In addition to this model, nyoo offers its services under a general contractor model.<sup>2</sup> This expands the Instone Group's affordable housing portfolio whilst also creating an offering for B2B clients and residential portfolio holders.\n\nAs well these opportunities, there is also a risk: Upon selling, nyoo gives responsibility for setting rents for all but the subsidised and pricecontrolled residential units to the buyer and thus no longer has any control over rental prices. At this point, it can no longer be ensured that the cost savings generated for the buyer by the optimised nyoo concept are passed on to the tenan[t. GRI 203, 203-1](#page-287-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The project development process takes place at the own expense of the project developer. The marketing risk is borne by the project developer itself.\n\n<sup>2</sup> A general contractor (GC) is responsible for all planning and engineering services as well as construction services for an owner under a works contract. The GC is free to award contracts to sub-contractors to provide the actual services. In the case of a project involving a TÜ, there is only one contract and contact person who hands over a turnkey property to the client on a contractually agreed date.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Development of neighbourhoods (S6) | Social commitment (S7)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDuring the early acquisition and planning permissions procurement phase, the Instone Group is in regular contact with cities and communities to establish meaningful added value above and beyond the urban development agreements. Early dialogue between all stakeholders, for example through innovative participation processes and the results of a careful site analysis, form the basis for needsbased neighbourhood development.\n\nIn order to find the best solutions for both the Instone Group and the city/ municipality and the neighbourhood, our internal social impact scoring model, which we developed in-house, is a good starting point. The scoring model enables us to examine and analyse the site as a whole in order to identify potential and needs and take into account social aspects. The following action areas have been identified that require special attention in this process:\n\n- Mobility\n- Sports/recreation\n- Culture\n- Health/care\n- Services\n- Commerce/local amenities\n- Education\n- Community offerings\n\nEvery site and the surrounding infrastructure are assessed according to these action areas before and after the project development process. The scoring model is then used to gauge the efficacy of the project with regard to the measures planned and the resulting social impact. A kit of best practice examples also provides creative ideas and solutions for meeting the identified needs of the site. The goal is to design new, attractive living space whilst also remaining cost-effective and sustainable. This is why the Instone Group factors the costs for developing sustainable energy and mobility concepts, for example, into its purchase estimate along with the \"classic parameters\" – the same goes for measures and activities to promote social interaction in a neighbourhoo[d.

A positive client experience as well as client satisfaction and loyalty are crucial to the Group's successful and sustainable growth. The topic \"Client satisfaction\" was identified in the materiality analysis as having double materiality.\n\nOn this basis, the Company established an exchange format (Vertical \"Client\") in the first quarter of the year. A systematic exchange on how to deal with enduser requirements takes place within the framework of regular work meetings. This is intended to further promote the continuous improvement and harmonisation of the initiatives initiated by the individual departments with regard to the customer experience. Firm fixtures of this exchange format are representatives from Corporate Marketing, Digital Strategy & Project Office – which oversees the digital solutions facing our buyers (e.g. the client portal and the customer relationship management software) – and management. Other operations employees join this group depending on the topic, for example from Client Management and Sales. Concrete measures resulting from these meetings which are currently being implemented include the redesign of our website and the revision of the client portal. The measures are intended to help optimise processes and thus improve the client experience.\n\nWith regard to the term \"client\", this section differentiates between \"institutional clients\" and \"end users\". These two groups of stakeholders have different priorities and motivations when it comes to sustainability, so they require a different assessment approach.\n\nInstitutional clients, particularly those in the financial sector, increasingly focus on a project's ESG concept as a whole and the company's ESG strategy. There is a particular focus on the aspect of climate change mitigation. This target group shows increased interest in documented sustainable building certifications (e.g. DGNB certifications) and in compliance with EU taxonomy requirements. The Instone Group keenly recognises that institutional clients' criteria relate in particular to the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the Principles for Adverse Impact, which constitute the basis for Article -8 and -9 fund products (sustainable and impact funds). With their long-term investment horizons, institutional clients have expressed to their clients a commitment to taking on far-reaching, voluntary obligations and targets, such as climate neutrality. Regulations are another key driver in this respect. The result is demand for increasingly green and sustainable assets in order to meet ambitious (climate) targets and minimise business risks from non-sustainable operations.\n\nThe topic of climate change is also important to end users. The difference, however, is that end users are more interested in a balanced cost ratio/the affordability of housing, which can also be achieved, for instance, by the unit having high energy efficiency and, as a result, lower operating costs (potentially higher purchase costs for the [new] unit amortised by longterm savings from greater energy efficiency compared to existing real estate, for example).\n\nThe operational branches and the Management Board are primarily responsible for managing the material topic in this action area. As part of their due diligence, they assume responsibility for planning and implementing measures for the material topic for clients and end users, and come to an agreement in accordance with the governance concept (se[e page 120\\). T](#page-119-0)he sustainability working groups also discuss the needs of clients and end users.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n#### **Client and end user measures TABLE 019**\n\nTABLE U\n\n| To our shareholders |  |  |  |\n|---------------------|--|--|--|\n|                     |  |  |  |\n\n**[management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)** \n\nRisk and\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n| Material topic      | Measure                                                                                      | Degree of<br>implementation |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Client satisfaction | Review of the feasibility of client preferences in the Instone Group's planning requirements | In progress                 |\n| Client satisfaction | Revision of the digital client survey concept to increase survey participation rates         | In progress                 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure; 2) In progress: Work is already proceeding to implement the measure; 3) Implemented: The measure has already been included in standard processes, e.g. in guidelines and work equipment.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\nThe Instone Group obtains information about clients' preferences and requirements through a continuous dialogue. Whilst institutional clients are managed by a single contact, such as a branch manager, the management or the Management Board, end users are supported by employees from Client Management or Sales during the buying process. In addition to in-person dialogue, the Instone Group conducts systematic, anonymous client satisfaction surveys of end users. The results of these surveys provide important information on end users' expectations, needs and perceptions, and are used for quality assurance and quality improvement purposes when making strategic decisions.\n\nThese client satisfaction surveys are conducted because client satisfaction is important to the Instone Group as a higher-level indicator for a benchmark amongst projects and for the Company overall. The Management Board decided in 2022 that an indicator of less than 2.4 (on a scale of 1 – very satisfied to 5 – not at all satisfied) can be taken to mean the client is satisfied. The indicator for client satisfaction for the projects handed over to end users in 2023 is 1.3 (result of a total of 37 survey responses). A high level of customer satisfaction can be derived from this result. Compared to the previous year, the value continued to increase (previous year: 1.7; result of a total of 67 survey responses). The surveys were carried out during the handover of the apartment.\n\nTo increase the participation rate and improve the interpretability and usability of the results, the concept of this digital client satisfaction survey was revised in the reporting year and divided into various topics. Beginning in 2024, feedback will also be obtained at two different times:\n\n1) After notarisation\n\n#### 2) After handover\n\nWhilst the first part of the survey focuses on **questions about the decision to buy**, the second part asks about **quality of service, willingness to recommend to others and an overall rating (indicator of client satisfaction)**. The client satisfaction indicator remains comparable in the new client satisfaction survey, since the question about satisfaction has not been altered. Since the change, the Corporate Marketing Department has been responsible for interpreting the survey. This means that the results can be analysed by a single department across all projects.\n\nThe Instone Group's goal is for the client to evaluate the process and their experience as soon as possible and to obtain a more differentiated view of the various process steps and departmental elements to produce valid results that we can then factor into decisionmaking and selection processes in order to optimise future activities.\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/22 description: The image contains two blue arrows.

The Group does this by examining the regulatory and market-driven requirements of institutional clients in detail and anticipating any resulting demands on the product. To that end, the Instone Group holds regular talks and meetings with institutional clients.\n\nWith regard to the preferred standard of living, the Instone Group responds to the demand of both end users and institutional clients to make units increasingly adaptable to accommodate different phases of life. This can be seen in the following characteristics in particular when planning projects:\n\n- Intelligent floor plans suitable for families with children, couples or single persons,\n- Accessible design within apartments and in communal areas as well as outside, which will ensure the infrastructure is sustainable and there is age-appropriate housing for the growing older population segment,\n- Energy efficiency and, ideally, no use of fossil fuels.\n\nThe Instone Group strives to achieve the highest possible satisfaction in every client group and to accommodate the needs of life into housing in the best possible way.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n<span id=\"page-119-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**[management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n### **Governance**\n\n# **Governance, risk management and internal control system**\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nRelevance of governance processes for the strategy, business model and organisation of the Instone Group  [GRI 2-9](#page-286-0)\n\nDetailed information on corporate governance and the principles of corporate governance at the Instone Group, particularly the cooperation between the Management Board and Supervisory Board, the composition of both Boards, and compliance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE is available in the corporate governance statement, which can be found in the combined management report o[n page 182 et seqq.](#page-181-0) \n\nIn preparation for the future requirements of the CSRD/ESRS, the operational managers and employees were included to a greater degree in the past financial year (see section \"Strategy and business model[\" page 50\\).](#page-49-0) This is also reflected in an expanded governance structure. In addition to established formats such as the Sustainability Committee, two other bodies have been formed to address and decide how to implement sustainability aspects, particularly at the project level:\n\n- Investment Committee (comprising all members of the Management Board and management) acts as a research body for examining and making decisions on topics that affect the Instone Group's project work\n- Branch Leadership team (comprising all members of the Management Board, management and branch managers) – responsible for exchanging ideas and assessing needs\n\nAs developments and the growing importance of sustainability dictate, the duties of the Sustainability Department have also grown. The department is now ultimately responsible for sustainability topics at the company and project level, and consolidates the topics in a multi-disciplinary manner.\n\n#### Governance concept structur[e TCFD governance](#page-289-0)\n\n#### Governance bodies\n\nBelow is a description of the duties, responsibilities and roles that are part of sustainability governance across all topics and bodies.

The Supervisory Board currently consists of six members. While the Management Board manages the Company, the Supervisory Board performs an advisory and monitoring function. Given the high relevance of the topic for the Instone Group, the Sustainability Department reports directly to the Management Board.\n\nFollowing the decision of the 2023 Annual General Meeting to add another person, the Supervisory Board of the Instone Group now has six members. The Annual General Meeting elected Sabine Georgi (currently Managing Director of ULI e.V.) to this newly created position on the Supervisory Board. Given her expertise and experience, Ms Georgi will focus on the topic of sustainability on the Supervisory Board and advise the Company on this matter.

Especially in the above exchange formats (Investment Committee and Branch Leadership team), they play a key role in implementing sustainability topics at the project level. They also discuss requirements and address new topics. As the main interface for sustainability topics at company and project level, the Sustainability department routinely reports on progress made towards achieving goals and takes on new requirements.\n\n#### **Sustainability department ( )**\n\nThe establishment of this department in 2021 laid the foundation for sustainability at the Instone Group. Comprehensive processes have been established for sustainability reporting, regulatory compliance and data management and are constantly being refined. The employees in the Sustainability department act as contacts for this specific topic and as the monitoring body for the recording of sustainability data in the Company, for example for sustainability and taxonomy reporting.\n\nThe department's duties have also grown in the past year to include the implementation of sustainability aspects in business operations. The Sustainability department now also acts as the main interface between the company and project levels. It actively helps shape the sustainable transformation of the Instone Group through activities such as initiating and leading company-wide working and discussion groups, and consolidates the topics in an overarching manner. In this way, whilst regulatory requirements are imposed on business operations, practical solutions are also developed that make a significant contribution to the achieving of targets, such as those on the path to climate neutrality by 2045. The department is also a source of company-wide knowledge and makes this information available to all employees. One example in this regard is the Company's Intranet, which was developed in-house and contains every finding from the current working groups on the topic of sustainability. An extensive media pool contains tangible work results as well as company-wide collections of best practices, checklists and guidelines. Operational sustainability topics in particular are also presented and discussed at regular expert meetings (such as the project developers' meeting) and regular branch meetings.\n\n#### **Sustainability Committee ( )**\n\nThe Sustainability department chairs the quarterly meeting of the Sustainability Committee on the communication, updating and preparation of decisions with cross-departmental implications. Each year, the committee addresses progress in achieving set sustainability targets, particularly the reduction of GHG emissions as part of our scientific climate target validated by the SBTi. Proposals for new targets or adjustments to targets introduced by the Sustainability department and, if applicable, other affected departments are discussed in connection with setting sustainability targets. Also discussed are the effectiveness and feasibility of measures and their implementation, though, as described above, the final decision lies with the CEO.\n\n#### **Operational working groups on sustainability topics**\n\nSince the end of 2022, five working groups with over 30 employees have been working hard to operationalise sustainability targets and establish them in practice. The groups' specific goals are derived from the topics identified by the Instone Group in its materiality analysis. They develop proposals for practical solutions and create guidelines for the Instone Group's future operations.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Presentation of the governance structure for sustainability topics**\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of an organizational structure. At the top is a blue rectangle labeled \"Supervisory Board.\" Below that is a black rectangle labeled \"Decision Level.\" Below that is a gray rectangle labeled \"Management Board.\" Below the Management Board are two blue rectangles. The rectangle on the left is labeled \"Implementation\" and has the following bullet points below it: \"Sustainability Committee,\" \"Management,\" \"Departments,\" and \"Working groups.\" The rectangle on the right is labeled \"Strategy and reporting\" and has \"Sustainability department\" below it. Arrows indicate the relationships between the different levels of the organization.\n\n**FIGURE 014**\n\n**Examples of governance structures in the implementation of topic-specific measures for environment and social issues1**\n\nAs part of the identification of material topics, we identified which topics have materiality and which have double materiality in the financial year 2022. Based on this, we performed a due diligence assessment of the impacts as well as the risks and opportunities under the direction of the Sustainability department and with the involvement of other relevant departments. In doing so, we recorded existing measures and added new measures in some cases.\n\nThe defined measures for each action area can be divided into two areas of responsibility. The first area relates to measures that can be implemented via corporate departments (such as Legal or Purchasing) for the Instone Group's business as a whole. These include contractual requirements for the Instone Group's contractual partners and checks to determine that they have been implemented, for instance in relation to compliance with the KrWG or environment-related provisions for construction site equipment. While the Sustainability department initiates the changes, the corporate department is responsible for implementation and verification. The Sustainability department records progress with the measures in its reporting. Progress is also discussed in the Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe second area relates to measures that are purely project-specific and thus fall under the responsibility of that project's manager. An example of this is compliance with biodiversity requirements when initiating projects, planning them and during construction. The Sustainability department is also involved here in the initiation of measures and raising employees' awareness of these measures. The measures are monitored in regular site discussions between the project managers and the respective contractual partners on the construction site, and are documented in minutes of the discussions. Operational working groups develop concrete measures in order to share learning outcomes across different sites, constantly improve project teams' sustainability skills and scale up innovative approaches and ideas.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Policies, work instructions and documentation**\n\nimposed requirements (list not exhaustive).\n\n• Code of Conduct for employees\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n• Code of Conduct for contractual partners • Accounting policy • Materiality analysis policy • Guideline and form for project-specific data collection for the EU taxonomy and associated sources • Building specification • Site regulations • Occupational health and safety information from the industry's\n\nThe following policies, working materials and guidelines exist in relation to the implementation of the sustainability strategy and the achievement of the targets set, and are amended as needed to newly\n\n- accident prevention and insurance association\n- Integration of technical rules for hazardous materials (TRGS)\n- Integration guideline for off-road machinery and equipment\n- Contracts with contractual partners and employees\n- Works contract for single or general contracts\n- ESG process documentation\n- Process documentation for GHG accounting\n- Process documentation for scenario analysis\n- Investment application template\n- Planning requirements\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Risk management, due diligence and internal control system\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nBased on the materiality analysis, the Instone Group has defined processes in place to ensure risk management and ongoing due diligence. Internal controls as part of the company-wide risk management system and a quarterly review by the Sustainability Committee ensure activities are conducted in the proper manner. An example of the process is illustrated in the following graphic.\n\nImage /page/123/Figure/17 description: This image is a figure titled \"Ensuring due diligence FIGURE 015\". It is a flow chart with four steps.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a consolidated non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have laid down their own interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated non-financial statement. They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the consolidated non-financial statement is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made.\n\n#### **Independence and quality assurance of the German Public Audit Firm**\n\nWe have observed German professional regulations as well as further professional rules of conduct.\n\nOur firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements – particularly of the \"Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors\" (BS WP/vBP) and of the Quality Management Standards promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated nonfinancial statement based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\", issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated nonfinancial statement.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between November 2023 and March 2024, we performed, among others, the following procedures and other work:\n\n- → Gaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organisation and of the stakeholder engagement\n- → Inquiries of the executive directors as well as relevant employees involved in the preparation of the consolidated non-financial statement regarding the preparation process including precautions and measures taken to prepare the consolidated non-financial statement as well as the disclosures made in the consolidated nonfinancial statement\n- → Assessment of the professional derivation and of the assessment of material business transactions in the context of the EU Taxonomy Regulations regarding the appropriateness of the respective reporting\n- → Identification of the risks of material misstatement within the consolidated non-financial statement\n- → Analytical assessment of disclosures within the consolidated nonfinancial statement\n- → Cross validation of selected disclosures and the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements as well as in the combined management report\n- → Assessment and presentation of the disclosures on sustainability\n- → Assessment of the process to identify taxonomy eligible and taxonomyaligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. The legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\n#### **Practitioner's conclusion**\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated nonfinancial statement of Instone Real Estate Group SE for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 does not comply, in all material respects, with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated non-financial statement.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThis conclusion solely relates to the text passages in the section \"Sustainability Report\" of Instone Real Estate Group SE's combined management report that are marked with the icon (\" \").

What measures is Instone Group taking to overcome them, and why is there still cause for optimism despite everything? The Management Board discusses these questions in this interview.*\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Because we continuously monitor and analyse the economic conditions and the status of our projects at very regular intervals, our response to this situation was early and far-sighted. Regarding new investments, we have been taking an opportunistic approach since as long ago as 2022. We conducted another critical reappraisal of our cost structure and adapted it accordingly last year. In procurement, we are also benefiting from having concluded fixedprice agreements and leveraged economies of scale at an early stage. This has allowed us to secure the scheduled construction progress across all projects.\n\n#### **How would you describe the impact of the market situation on sales business?**\n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** Compared with previous years, demand for new homes was low, as expected. We were not immune to the negative effects of rising interest rates and the growing uncertainty among private and institutional investors. However, we observed a moderate upturn in demand towards the end of last year. Against all odds, we sold properties with a value of more than €211 million in 2023. In addition, the positive response to the sales launch of our new projects gives us confidence that our core business will pick up significantly this year. At the same time, we are planning our marketing activities much more actively and rigorously so that we can also withstand the industry pressures on a long-term basis.\n\n### **The ongoing crisis within the industry has hit several competitors. What challenges does this entail for a CFO?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** When a heavy storm approaches, like the one we've been going through, the first priority is to make the company even more crisis-resistant so that opportunities can be seized again afterwards. We identified the major turning point in the market at an early stage, and we made the necessary adjustments back in the middle of last year. Specifically, this meant focusing more strongly on cutting costs and securing liquidity. For instance, we met our cost-cutting targets and successfully reduced our platform costs. We deferred investments in new properties. Overall, our balance sheet has been further strengthened as a result. And this is acknowledged by our financing partners, which is why we continue to have unlimited access to capital – something that is definitely an exception at the moment.\n\n#### **Do you also see opportunities arising from the current market situation? How are you positioned to take advantage of them?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** The current industry crisis will accelerate the consolidation within the industry. The German market is highly fragmented, and it is now clearly apparent that many competitors lack such things as the financial strength to survive in the market. Along with our considerable expertise, which is reflected in factors such as our leading profitability, Instone Group has a very strong balance sheet. This puts us in a position to remain active on the property market, and we will do so again soon. Not many project developers can say that. As such, we will be able to gain further market share in the future. Our bargaining power in relation to property buyers and suppliers has improved considerably.\n\n### *\"We are in a position to remain active on the property market, and we will do so again soon. Not many project developers can say that.\"*\n\n### **David Dreyfus** CFO\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/12 description: A man in a blue suit is sitting at a table with a laptop. The text \"CFO David Dreyfus is optimistic about Instone Group's future.\" is in the lower left corner of the image.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Moreover, we are not just sitting tight on our ship and watching what the storm is doing to us. We are pursuing various strategic options for strengthening our balance sheet even further, including above and beyond our core business. Are our products solely of interest to investors and owner-occupiers? What additional strategic options can we pursue, and what business partnerships might suit Instone Group? We are intensively examining the answers to these and other questions. And I will be glad to share further details with our stakeholders as soon as we initiate tangible projects in these areas.\n\n#### **Let's turn to Instone Group's shares. The crisis within the industry has hit the share price hard. How do you see things developing next?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** As expected, Instone Group's shares were not immune to the challenging macro-environment. It goes without saying that we are not happy about this. However, in our discussions with analysts and investors, we are also hearing that Instone Group's strategy is widely supported, and that we are expected to be a major beneficiary when the market recovers. Most market players believe it is merely a matter of when and not if this happens. Ultimately, the growing shortage of housing clearly vindicates our business model. Having welcomed several prestigious institutional investors again in recent months, we are feeling positive about the future. The analysts who follow us closely also see significant upside potential, with an average target price of €10 per share.\n\n**Last year, Instone Group made a commitment to being a pioneer within the industry when it comes to sustainability. Is this still realistic in view of the current cost pressure?**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Our intentions in terms of sustainability are more than just lip service – they are now the clear benchmark for our own actions, and hence an increasingly integral aspect in all phases of our value chain. Of course, we are a business with an interest in profitability and efficiency. At the same time, we have a social and ecological responsibility as a project developer. Finding solutions to these supposedly conflicting goals is our aspiration and our obligation. In our view, sustainable action and economic efficiency are not mutually exclusive. Both aspects are becoming increasingly interdependent as the expectations of investors, municipalities and customers grow with regard to sustainability.\n\n*\"Of course, we are a business with an interest in profitability and efficiency.

What goal are you pursuing with them? What findings have already resulted from this teamwork?**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Our ambitious sustainability goals require clearly defined steps. To ensure that we don't just address these topics theoretically and to avoid instances where implementation may be infeasible, we apply our internal expertise and collective intelligence to develop solutions. The main goal of our working groups is to conduct a holistic assessment of the lifecycle of our buildings. Each phase is critically assessed with regard to sustainability aspects – from the selection of the construction materials through the construction process to subsequent use. Every element, however small, helps us to improve the environmental footprint of our properties while creat-\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Instone Group**\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/1 description: A man in a suit and glasses is sitting at a table, pointing his finger at someone out of frame.

The background is a white brick wall.\n\nCOO Andreas Gräf is confident that the new brand identity will help to boost the external visibility of the company's strengths even more.\n\ning added value for the neighbourhood and society. To this end, our team of more than 30 internal experts have already obtained promising insights that we will apply in individual construction projects this year For instance, the hybrid timber working group has examined the extent to which a reduction in grey emissions (embodied carbon) is possible by replacing the structural components with timber solutions. In one specific example, calculations were made for various structures in order to compare them with regard to cost, quality and construction time savings. We are pleased that we are now putting the results into practice.\n\n**In this way, sustainability is becoming increasingly ingrained in how the company views itself. What difference is that making to the company's image?** \n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** We have adopted a clear attitude and developed expertise in the area of sustainability. What this means is we can no longer sail under the radar. In recent months, we have therefore critically analysed our brand identity, which had hardly changed since 2017, and revamped it. Our entire team is working passionately to plan and construct our residential neighbourhoods to deliver substantial added value for the community and the environment – and yet there was barely a hint of this in our corporate identity previously. By embodying our new and clearly defined brand essence, we will impress right across the board in future in terms of our identity, our image and our quality. If you've read an annual report of Instone Group before, you'll no doubt recognise our more clearly defined positioning in the layout.\n\n#### **Finally, how would you describe Instone Group's new brand personality?**\n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** We aim to be **the** housing developer in Germany, and we have set ourselves high targets. Whatever challenges we face, we will keep on taking **bold steps.**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Thanks to the expertise of our team and our strong financial foundations, our projects and our performance are **genuinely good.**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** We act transparently, seek out dialogue on continuous improvement and strive to keep our stakeholders' best interests at heart.

In the current crisis within the industry, rigorous adherence to this principle is paying off, and Instone Group remains a reliable partner for various stakeholders.*\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n> Instone Group's growth strategy has always involved one key element: a strong balance sheet with healthy profitability provides the foundations for sustainably successful business development that benefits all stakeholders. The systematic pursuit of this principle is now paying off in the current crisis within the industry. Thanks to its extremely robust financial position, Instone Group remains a reliable partner to lenders, customers, employees, suppliers, and sellers of land. We are proud to say that this has always been a part of how we view ourselves. Whereas some merely pay lip service to the concept, we ensure that our stability remains clearly visible. Downtime is an alien concept on our construction sites. Instone always finishes what it starts. *I*\n\nContinued overleaf\n\n### Three questions for David Dreyfus\n\n**You were appointed as the new CFO of the Instone Group on 1 September 2023. What were the main issues during the initial phase?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Obviously, lots of different things demand your attention whenever you start a new role. However, I was able to rely on the support of a skilled and experienced team. One major achievement was the successful placement of a new promissory note loan with a volume of €20 million in October 2023 in spite of the bad news emanating from the industry. This served to underline the position Instone Group enjoys with its financing partners even in times like these.\n\n#### **David Dreyfus** CFO\n\nDavid Dreyfus has been the CFO of Instone Real Estate Group SE since September 2023. He has more than 28 years of professional experience in corporate finance and capital market transactions thanks to his various roles, including as a partner at the consulting firm Lilja & Co. and M&A Director at Lazard.\n\n**You are keen to emphasise the remarkable strength of Instone Group's balance sheet. What form does this take?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** At the reporting date, our loan-to-cost ratio (the ratio of inventories and contract assets to financial liabilities) was just 15.1 percent. This is extremely low compared with our sector peer group. Free cash and cash equivalents amounted to €383.6 million as at 31 December 2023. The company also has unutilised credit facilities and project finance for guaranteeing project completion amounting to €304.6 million. In other words, the company enjoys a very robust financial position.\n\n**Many construction projects in Germany are coming to a standstill in the construction phase. Is this not also a risk factor for Instone Group?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Absolutely not. Our projects under construction are fully financed and already have an impressive sales level. A project volume of €2.9 billion is currently in the construction phase. 89 percent of this figure is already sold, meaning that the corresponding cash inflows are guaranteed. We completed all of our projects on schedule in 2023. As such, I am confident that Instone Group is extremely well positioned to emerge from the difficult current market situation even stronger than before.\n\nGenuinely good\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n> Among other things, our strong balance sheet is characterised by extremely low leverage and extremely high liquidity compared with our sector peer group. That is no coincidence, but rather the result of a forward-looking business policy that has always been based on the belief that a company needs to take precautions against potential downturns and ensure that it is resilient. This includes an understanding that crisis situations can give rise to particular opportunities. We intend to leverage these opportunities and make project acquisitions as soon as the market has visibly stabilised. Our liquidity situation will allow us to respond quickly once this is the case.\n\nOne of Instone Group's main strengths – and something that plays a key role in reducing its risk profile – is the extensive portfolio of projects that it has already sold. This means it can rely on considerable future cash inflows with a high degree of certainty, which serves to reinforce its financial strength.\n\nFrom a very early stage, Instone's growth strategy targeted brownfield projects in line with its sustainability focus. This involves housing development projects on spaces that are already in use or have been developed. Among other things, this prevents the need for additional surface sealing, which is more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient. Unlike many of its competitors, Instone Group is well versed in complex urban planning projects and possesses in-house expertise in the area of construction management. This outstanding project development quality within the industry is ultimately also reflected in healthy profitability that benefits all stakeholder groups. As a result, we remain able to act even in times of cost and price pressure and can absorb these adverse effects better than many of our competitors. Our clear strategy combined with our financial strength provides the solid ground upon which our customers, subcontractors and employees can lay the foundations for a good life. We are proud to be seen as a reliable and sustainable partner not only within our industry, but by society as a whole.

A lot has happened since then: The first nyoo projects have been completed and handed over to the buyers, competitions have been won and new properties have been purchased. But the origins of nyoo go back much further.*\n\nProject \"DUI 06\", Duisburg (Artist's impression from 2021/22)\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n> ack in 2015, Kruno Crepulja, CEO of the Instone Group, and current nyoo Managing Director Stefan Dahlmanns were discussing the nature of planning and construction in Germany. \"We soon agreed that substantial change was required in order to enable the planning, construction and use of residential buildings to be managed sustainably and efficiently in the future,\" says Stefan Dahlmanns. \"Complex and multifaceted processes, constantly increasing requirements and labourintensive, traditional building methods are no recipe for competitive housing construction in Germany – especially with an ongoing skills shortage.\" *B*\n\n> The fact is that continuously new prototype planning in housing construction, particularly for affordable homes, is inefficient. In view of the growing housing shortage in Germany, it is imperative to shorten project times as effectively as possible. One sensible approach is to make planning processes thoroughly standardised. This prevents every project from having to start from scratch and allows economies of scale to be leveraged.\n\n### The nyoo concept\n\nThe decision to invest strategically in standardisation and digitalisation while tapping into new markets was taken at an early stage. However, the systematic shift from individual project development to serial product development requires a focused initiative that is separate from day-to-day project business. With this in mind, nyoo was established as a standalone platform that is wholly dedicated to developing the new line of business. Since then, an interdisciplinary team has been working constantly to enhance the concept and deliver and acquire nyoo projects throughout Germany.\n\n*\"Thanks to our wide range of services covering the entire value chain, we can provide our customers with affordable housing as an a full-service package from a single source.\"*\n\n**Stefan Dahlmanns** Managing Director\n\nThe nyoo concept is based on three pillars: **product, process, production.** \n\n**Compact and scalable product** – The concept is built around the rigorous standardisation and digitalisation of planning and product. BIM-based, fully eligible for funding and compliant with building law throughout Germany, this planning module for multi-storey residential and townhouse construction forms the basis for every nyoo project. The innovative aspect is that, despite a high level of scalability, the concept has substantial variability in terms of architecture and urban planning and enables a flexible, rapid response to individual property conditions.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/14 description: A man with a beard is smiling and wearing a white shirt. He is standing outside and appears to be talking to someone, as there is a hand raised in front of him.\n\n#### **Stefan Dahlmanns**\n\nStefan Dahlmanns is the Managing Director responsible for Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. The qualified architect, real estate economist and project developer ran the North Rhine-Westphalia branch of Instone and its predecessor formart from 2013 to 2020. Before that, he worked as a partner for a large German architecture firm in Cologne. This means he has many years' experience in the development, planning and delivery of large-scale urban development and architectural design projects.\n\n**13**\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Standardised and low-interface process** – Lean construction is increasingly becoming the industry standard for modern site management. nyoo goes much further, and has shifted the entire planning and development process to a digital process map. Through its stake in beeboard GmbH, nyoo was heavily involved in developing the digital project management and communication tool that enables collaborative work within the project team. This results in a significant increase in efficiency while also ensuring process quality.\n\n### **Our three pillars: product, process and production**\n\n**Efficient and non technology-specific production** –\n\nConventional construction methods are evolving and increasingly being supplemented by elements of industrial prefabrication, as in the case of bathrooms, lift cores and balconies, for instance. This helps to reduce construction time considerably while maintaining a high level of workmanship or even improving on it. Attention is also paid to the future in areas such as production and the use of renewable raw materials. In this way, the ideal foundations are being put in place for continuously increasing the proportion of prefabrication in the years ahead.\n\n### The nyoo product is an all-round package for third parties\n\n\"As well as making our concept available to investors in the form of conventional trade development, we offer our services on third-party sites as part of a general contractor model for portfolio holders, municipal housing companies and cooperatives,\" says Stefan Dahlmanns. \"The great thing is that, thanks to our wide range of services covering the entire value chain, we can provide our customers with affordable housing as a full-service package from a single source.\"\n\nWith its innovative concept, nyoo is delivering answers to the question of how planning and construction can be made sustainable and efficient – both now and in the future.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/8 description: The image shows a modern, multi-story residential building with a white facade and dark gray balconies.

Key factors in the project's success include partnership-driven cooperation and transparent communication.* \n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Instone Group**\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/1 description: Two men are standing outside in front of a building. The man on the left is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt. The man on the right is wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and a brown belt. The text on the image says that the man on the left is Paul Kienlin and the man on the right is Roman Richter. The text also says that they regularly meet on site to discuss the current issues concerning Parkstadt.\n\n **ith Parkstadt, Instone is developing a new residential neighbourhood with around 600 apartments on a former hospital site comprising some 14 hectares. Why do you consider Parkstadt Leipzig to be a flagship project?** *W*\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Parkstadt was constructed in the late 19th century and is one of the most important examples of pavilion-style construction in Germany. It boasts stylish original façades and trees that are over 120 years old. Parkstadt Leipzig is a place where people can truly enjoy a high quality of life in a park environment, especially in spring and autumn when the atmosphere is awash with light.\n\n**PAUL KIENLIN** When I visited Parkstadt for the first time after joining Instone in 2019, I was struck by the size of the project, as well as the dilapidated condition of some of the existing listed buildings. I realised we would have a big task ahead of us. Today, four years later, the southern section is nearly complete and the results are more than impressive. We are seeing the emergence of a new residential neighbourhood that offers a high standard of living – a unique combination of old and new buildings that embodies the historical and the modern alike.\n\n#### **What were the challenges during the planning and construction phase?**\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Because the City of Leipzig also had a keen interest in giving Parkstadt a new lease on life, the project enjoyed particular attention right from the very beginning. For example, we held numerous coordination meetings with the city authorities while the development plan was being drawn up, which took several years.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/1 description: The image shows two buildings with red roofs, surrounded by trees.

In particular, rising interest rates meant that demand for larger and more expensive apartments declined in favour of smaller apartments, which meant that we had to make some changes to our plans. The funding landscape is also subject to continuous change, and the same is true for the statutory requirements in areas such as heating systems. It is important for us to be able to respond flexibly in order to create properties that are energy-efficient yet affordable despite these challenges.\n\n**As a company, we are confident that project development achieves the best results when we approach all tasks cooperatively and work together to resolve them. What role does this mindset play when it comes to the realisation of the Parkstadt project?**\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Partnership-driven cooperation and transparent communication – both internally and externally – were vital to the success of this project, too. Ultimately, all of the stakeholders have the same objective: to create apartments and neighbourhoods that offer a high standard of living. Every challenge and every milestone demanded close cooperation within our team and with the City of Leipzig.\n\n**PAUL KIENLIN** I would have to agree. For a project of this size in particular, regular dialogue is essential. Everyone across every department is on board, from the buyers, customer managers and sales staff through to the project managers and project developers. There is a lot of discussion and debate, but we always end up finding a solution that works for everyone. The same is true for coordination with the authorities. We have occasionally had to deal with differing requirements from various departments, including heritage protection, fire safety and environ-\n\n### **About the interviewees**\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/14 description: A man with a beard is smiling at the camera.

The cumulative effects of rising construction costs and the negative impacts of soaring interest rates on corporate finance and demand for housing in particular posed difficulties for many companies, in some cases putting their survival at risk. In this highly challenging environment, the Instone Group performed extremely well, meeting its financial targets for 2023 in full. This clearly reflects the strength of our platform. Adjusted revenue for 2023 totalled €616 million. A high adjusted gross profit margin of 25.1 percent again underlines our best-in-class profitability. At €48.2 million, adjusted earnings after tax actually came in at the upper end of our forecast range of €40 million to €50 million.\n\nA strong balance sheet is a key pillar of our corporate strategy. In this challenging market environment in particular, our sound financial position is beneficial in our dealings with finance providers, suppliers and customers. At the reporting date, leverage amounted to just 2.1 percent. The Instone Group holds substantial cash and cash equivalents of €383.6 million. These key figures were boosted further by the positive operating cash flow in 2023.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/19 description: A man with short brown hair and a white shirt under a dark suit jacket is smiling at the camera. The background is blurred and appears to be a brightly lit office space.\n\n### **Kruno Crepulja** Chairman of the Management Board and CEO\n\nInstone Group continues to boast an extensive portfolio of projects that have already been sold. Accordingly, these projects can be expected to generate further substantial cash inflows with a high degree of certainty. A project volume of €2.9 billion is currently in the construction phase. €2.6 billion or 89 percent of this figure is already sold.\n\nWe expect this position of strength compared to many competitors will also give to particular growth opportunities which we intend to take advantage of. We aim to gain significant market share in a highly fragmented market. Our assumption is that the crisis is not yet over and will continue during 2024. However, we are noticing a general improvement in sentiment on the part of our private and institutional customers, especially since the final quarter of 2023. The current easing of the interest rate situation is a major factor in this, although we are not yet anticipating a swift return to normal levels of demand.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n- **[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)**\n- [The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDemand for homes remains huge, and the prevailing shortage of housing in German metropolitan areas is set to intensify further over the coming years as a result of net migration and declining construction activity. With our business model, we stand to benefit from this structural demand overhang as an effective and reliable partner for our customers, suppliers and municipalities and we will position ourselves as a solution provider. This applies in particular to the affordable housing sector. With our subsidiary nyoo, we are able to build more cost-effectively than our competitors using standardised and digitalised planning in conjunction with a serial building method, meaning we can provide urgently needed affordable housing on the market. Our objective remains for the affordable housing segment to account for around half of all homes developed by the Instone Group by 2030.\n\nAs one of Germany's biggest residential developers, we are aware of our social and ecological responsibility. We reconcile economic growth with social requirements and aspects of environmental protection as a matter of principle. Our aspiration is to be pioneers of ESG within the industry. Around 30 of our employees are doing their utmost to move us even further forward on these issues in various working groups. This shows that we are actively committed to this goal rather than merely paying lip service to it. We have adopted a clear attitude and developed expertise in this area. Thanks to our more clearly defined, modern and authentic new brand positioning, our self-image is now also reflected in our revamped corporate identity.\n\nWe anticipate a moderate upturn in demand for new housing in 2024. We continue to benefit from an extensive portfolio of homes that have already been sold. On this basis, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of €500 million to €600 million and adjusted earnings after tax of €30 million to €40 million for 2024. We expect a sales volume of more than €300 million. Our platform has demonstrated its effectiveness even during the current crisis. This is down to the expertise and commitment of our entire team. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of our employees.\n\nDear shareholders, I would also like to expressly thank you for the confidence and loyalty you have placed in us.

Sharp increases in financing and construction costs have massively slowed down new building work in Germany, which is urgently needed, and continue to do so. Inflation for the year as a whole is still on average just under 6%, which has had a lasting negative impact on consumer confidence and investment decisions. In addition, ongoing or resurfaced geopolitical conflicts and economic uncertainties are further exacerbating this effect. This becomes clear, for example, when we consider the reliability of framework conditions for the funding environment of new construction projects, which is so very important for the residential real estate industry and therefore also for us.\n\nI am therefore all the more pleased that our company performed so well in this extremely challenging environment and despite all the difficulties, only some of which I have mentioned. This is thanks to Instone Group taking the right course of action early on, with both determination and focus — which is now paying off once again. Restrained acquisition, measures to further increase efficiency, such as reviewing and adapting the existing project pipeline to changing demand and funding conditions, strengthening the balance sheet — to highlight just a few of the factors behind our success.\n\nWith this in mind, our committee work during the past financial year once again mainly involved extensive and regular supervision of the Company's current situation and the Management Board's strategy. Against this\n\nbackground, I am firmly convinced, and I am speaking here for the entire Supervisory Board, that thanks to our strategic focus and the commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, which is a key element of that focus, we are very well positioned to continue to successfully overcome the challenges we will face in the future — while at the same time taking advantage of the opportunities that arise to ensure our Company's success.\n\nIn this context, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly make specific mention of last year's Management Board and Supervisory Board members. Firstly, we succeeded in filling the position of the CFO, which became vacant in the second half of the financial year, with an excellent candidate in David Dreyfus, an internationally recognised and highly experienced corporate finance and capital market specialist. Secondly, our Supervisory Board has also seen personnel and structural changes during the past financial year. By expanding the committee by one person and appointing Sabine Georgi, with our shareholders' support, we have further strengthened the Supervisory Board's profile on sustainability issues, and have also consequently continued along the path we have set of increasing the number of female members on our committee. With the appointment of Stefan Mohr as representative of our largest individual shareholder, Activum SG Capital, the composition of our committee also takes into account the current shareholder structure of the Instone Group — in line with good corporate governance.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Dr Foruhar Madjlessi for the close and trusting cooperation and the excellent work he has done during his term of office. I would also like to thank Thomas Hegel very much for his work on our Supervisory Board. He has been an important driving force on our committee since 2019.\n\nFinally, on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, our shareholders, for the confidence you once again showed in our Company over the past financial year.\n\nIn the following, we would like to inform you about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board fulfilled all the duties assigned to it by the law and the Articles of Association in the 2023 financial year. It monitored the Management Board's management of the Company and was available to advise the Management Boar[d.

The Supervisory Board also discussed the deliberations of the Management Board concerning the establishment of a sales channel using fund structures and the search for a potential female candidate for election to the Supervisory Board. At its balance sheet meeting in March, the Supervisory Board also held detailed discussions on the audited annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, including the combined management report for the 2022 financial year, and then approved and adopted these. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board approved the proposal for the appropriation of profits and the remuneration report for the 2022 financial year.

The Supervisory Board also received reports on the status of the business and looked several times in detail at the termination of the Management Board mandate of Dr Foruhar Madjlessi and the search for a new candidate to fill the position of CFO.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Supervisory Board held a total of six meetings. At the first two meetings in April 2023, the topics up for discussion included the agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the resolutions recommended by the Supervisory Board as well as its proposals for the planned elections to the Supervisory Board. At the third Supervisory Board meeting in April 2023, the Board received reports on the status of the business in accordance with the usual schedule and once again looked into the personnel details relating to the elections planned at the 2023 Annual General Meeting for the Supervisory Board and the organisation of the Annual General Meeting as an in-person event, to which it agreed as proposed by the Management Board.

GRI 2-18](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Supervisory Board committees\n\nTo streamline the work of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board had three standing committees with various responsibilities in the 2023 financial year, each of which has three members in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board: the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Other committees may be set up by the Supervisory Board as required. The committees prepare the deliberations and resolutions of the plenum in their areas of responsibility. In addition, they make decisions in the context of various tasks defined in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, insofar as the Supervisory Board has delegated these tasks to the relevant committee in the Rules of Procedure. Further information on the roles and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board committees is provided in the corporate governance statemen[t page 182.](#page-181-0)\n\n#### **Audit Committee**\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee in the year under review were Dr Jochen Scharpe (Chair), Stefan Brendgen, Thomas Hegel (up to the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023) and Stefan Mohr (since 14 June 2023). The Audit Committee held eight meetings during the year under review. No written resolutions were passed.\n\nThe topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the period under review included the internal audit personnel, the recommendation to the full Supervisory Board to approve the plan and the budget for 2023 and to approve or accept the consolidated and annual financial statements 2022, the proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2022 financial year, the recommendation for the proposed auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, the existing finance structure at Company and project level, the Company's obligations under existing financial contracts, the audit plan and the main focal points for the auditor and the awarding of the audit contract, the fast close\n\nprocess for the quarterly and six-monthly financial reports and the initial draft for the corporate plan and the budget for the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe Audit Committee also held an intensive discussion over several meetings on the current structure of the Instone Group internal control system and its future development. During the calendar year, the committee also looked at the work by the Company's internal audit team, including in particular the annual audit report 2022/2023 and the personnel resources of the internal audit team. Finally, the Audit Committee looked in detail at the risk management system and the risk reporting system.\n\nIn the past financial year, the Chair of the Audit Committee also made regular use of the opportunity to obtain information directly from the heads of the central divisions of the Company on selected topics.\n\n#### **Nomination Committee**\n\nThe members of the Nomination Committee during the year under review were Thomas Hegel (Chair and committee member until the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023), Stefan Brendgen (Chair since 14 June 2023), Dr Jochen Scharpe (until the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023), Christiane Jansen and Stefan Mohr (since 14 June 2023). The Nomination Committee did not hold any meetings during the year under review. It passed one written resolution.\n\nThe subject of the resolution passed in writing by the Nomination Committee was the proposal to the full Supervisory Board for the election of the members of the Supervisory Board by the 2022 Annual General Meeting and the process for the search for another female member of the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Remuneration Committee**\n\nThe members of the Remuneration Committee in the 2023 financial year were Dietmar P. Binkowska (Chair), Stefan Brendgen and Dr Jochen Scharpe. The Remuneration Committee held a total of three meetings in the year under review. The committee did not pass any written resolutions during the year under review.\n\nAt its meetings, the Remuneration Committee discussed in particular the recommendations to the full Supervisory Board for setting the\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n**[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)**\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nManagement Board remuneration for 2022, the recommendations to the full Supervisory Board for setting the targets for the variable Management Board remuneration, the remuneration report for the 2022 financial year and the status of target achievement for the short-term variable remuneration for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Trusting cooperation between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the context of the topics outlined above and other matters, the Supervisory Board carefully and regularly monitored the management of the Company by the Management Board and supported it on the strategic development of the Company and key decisions. The same applies to the committees of the Supervisory Board within the scope of their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nOnce again in the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board discussed strategic matters with the Management Board in addition to and outside its meetings. In the past year, the focal points included the strategic development of the existing business and the macro-economic environment, the continued development of the Instone Group in terms of ESG and digitalisation, and the development of the share price.\n\nThe Management Board informed the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively about any and all aspects that were material to the Company, and fulfilled its reporting duties as specified by law, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure. Above all, these included the business development of the Instone Group, sales activities, construction cost developments, the development of the share price and fundamental matters concerning corporate planning, strategy and organisation. The Management Board also reported extensively to the Supervisory Board on the business performance of the Instone Group in conference calls that took place in addition to Supervisory Board meetings in connection with the publication of the quarterly statements and the half-yearly financial report. Even outside meetings, the Chairman of the Management Board in particular had intensive and regular exchanges, especially with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nBusiness and transactions requiring the consent of the Supervisory Board under the Articles of Association or Rules of Procedure of the Management Board were submitted to the Supervisory Board by the Management Board for resolution by the Supervisory Board and were discussed in detail with the Supervisory Board in advance of said resolution. In the past financial year, this included in particular the matter of increasing the strategic holding in beeboard GmbH.\n\n#### Corporate governance and declaration of conformity\n\nBoth the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are committed to the principles of good corporate governance in accordance with the recommendations of the German Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code. In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board therefore again extensively and repeatedly dealt with corporate governance matters.\n\nThis included, for example, filling the position of CFO following the resignation of Dr Foruhar Madjlessi from the Management Board, the search for candidates and proposals for filling two seats on the Supervisory Board, the target for the number of female members of the Supervisory Board, Management Board remuneration and the skills profile and qualification matrix for members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn December 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE issued a joint declaration of conformity with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with the provisions of Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act after in-depth deliberations. It is included in the annual report 2023 o[n page 182 a](#page-181-0)nd can also be found on the Company's ä [website](http://www.instone-group.de/en) in the Investor Relations section under Instone Group Compliance Statement.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board also report in detail on the corporate governance of Instone Real Estate Group SE in the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f, 315d of the German Commercial Code, which can be found o[n page 182 o](#page-181-0)f this annual report. The corporate governance statement can also be found on the Company's ä [website in](http://www.instone-group.de/en) the Investor Relations section.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the GCGC, the Supervisory Board also informs the Annual General Meeting of conflicts of interest among members of the Supervisory Board. No such conflicts of interest were disclosed to or identified by the Supervisory Board during the entire period under review.\n\nThe Company supports the members of the Supervisory Board in taking advantage of training and further education options on Supervisory Board-specific topics, for instance by bearing the required costs of such training.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n**[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)**\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Personnel changes in the Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThere were changes in personnel in both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\nDr Foruhar Madjlessi left the Management Board with effect from 31 August 2023 after his Management Board mandate was ended by mutual agreement. The Supervisory Board filled the resulting vacant position of CFO with the appointment of David Dreyfus. He was appointed a member of the Management Board with effect from 1 September 2023 to 31 December 2027.\n\nAt the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023, Thomas Hegel left the Company's Supervisory Board after resigning his mandate prematurely with effect from that date. Stefan Mohr was elected as the new member of the Supervisory Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting until the Annual General Meeting which will be convened to approve the Company's activities for the 2025 financial year. Sabine Georgi is also a new member of the Supervisory Board. She was elected to the Supervisory Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting for the same period and will therefore fill the sixth seat on the Supervisory Board which was also newly created by the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n#### Audit of annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Dusseldorf, was elected as auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year by the Annual General Meeting of the Company and commissioned by the Supervisory Board. The focal points of the audit were discussed in detail with the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting on 12 September 2023 and established accordingly.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted in the European Union and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code.\n\nThe auditor provided its report and the documentation relating to the financial statements for the 2023 financial year to the members of the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board on 11 March 2024.\n\nThe report was discussed in detail at the Audit Committee meeting and the financial statements review meeting held by the plenary Supervisory Board on 11 March 2024. The auditor was present at both meetings. The auditor provided detailed reports on the main findings of the audit at the meetings and answered all the questions posed by members of the Audit Committee and the plenum. In addition, the auditor provided information about services provided by it in addition to the auditing services. There was no evidence of bias on the part of the auditor.\n\nThe auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023 and the combined management report on 11 March 2024. Following a detailed review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report as at 31 December 2023 by the Audit Committee, the latter recommended its approval to the plenum. Per the final result of its own review, no objections were raised by the Supervisory Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Management Board. The annual financial statements have therefore been adopted. The Supervisory Board has reviewed and carefully considered the proposal put forward by the Management Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting for the appropriation of the net profit for the 2023 financial year and agrees with this proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the members of the Management Board and all employees of the Instone Group for their outstanding commitment and excellent performance in the past financial year.\n\nEssen, 11 March 2024\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nStefan Brendgen\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n### **EQUITY STORY**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n#### **Equity story**\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/16 description: The image contains a blue icon of a city skyline next to the words \"Benefiting high density German\".\n\n**Benefiting greatly from the high demand for housing in German cities:** \n\nAs one of Germany's leading residential real estate developers, the Instone Group is benefiting in the medium-term from stable growing demand for housing coupled with low availability of housing, particularly in metropolitan areas.\n\nThe Instone Group is one of the few developers established Germany-wide that focuses on attractive locations in the country's key metropolitan areas and their catchment areas. One key competitive factor is the Group's extensive expertise along the entire value chain, which spans site acquisition and development, planning and construction management, and the sale of the residential units. This comprehensive expertise is also reflected in a sector-leading gross margin of around 25%, which is sustainable even in the face of a slump in current markets and cost inflation. Among other things, this also gives the Instone Group flexibility in terms of pricing.\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/20 description: The image shows a blue icon of a square with rounded corners. Inside the square is a line drawing of a house with a slanted roof and a door. A pencil is positioned diagonally across the house, as if drawing or editing it. To the right of the icon are the words \"Inn\" stacked on top of \"ext\".\n\n**Innovative nyoo promises extra growth potential:**\n\nThe innovative product nyoo for affordable housing gives the Instone Group a clear edge over the competition and considerable potential for growth. After several years of development, the company has managed to significantly reduce planning and construction costs by intelligently standardising the planning process and streamlining the production process. The digitalisation of the planning process and creation of a highly scalable product are key factors to this success. This product is also predestined for the growth field of subsidised housing construction. The expansion of the nyoo business is a key pillar of the medium-term growth strategy, with the annual revenue share of the affordable housing product segment expected to increase to at least 50% by 2030.\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/23 description: The image shows a blue icon of a euro bill with a padlock on top of it. The icon is inside a rounded square with a white background.\n\n**High cash flow security as a result of projects under construction that already have a buyer:**\n\nThe project portfolio secured as at 31 December 2023 with an expected volume of sales contracts of €7.0 billion provides a high level of visibility for the future.\n\nOf this €7.0 billion, projects accounting for around €2.9 billion of revenue are already in the construction phase. Of these, housing accounting for around €2.6 billion of revenue, or around 89%, had already been sold as of 31 December 2023. This makes expected future revenues and cash flows highly secure and therefore strongly protects against risk, especially as the market currently experiences a period of slowdown.\n\nThe Instone Group expects the projects already under construction to generate high, largely hedged operating cash flow over the next three years, which can be used to consolidate the balance sheet, invest in future growth and pay attractive dividends.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n**[Equity story](#page-29-0)**\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/15 description: The image shows a blue icon of a magnifying glass over a bar graph. The magnifying glass is on the left side of the image, and the bar graph is on the right side of the image. The icon is enclosed in a rounded square.\n\n**Strong balance sheet secures defensive risk profile and underpins medium-term growth:**\n\nThe Instone Group has a healthy balance sheet, which was further strengthened in 2023. This gives it a clear competitive advantage, especially given the current climate in the sector. The low debt ratio as at the reporting date is reflected in the leverage ratio of 2.1 (net financial liabilities/EBITDA) and a loan-to-costratio of 15.1%. In addition, the company has €383.6 million of liquidity as at 31 December 2023. This gives the Instone Group sufficient financial leeway to pursue project acquisition opportunities in the coming year.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/18 description: The image shows a blue icon of a hand holding three people, next to the words \"Clear responsibilities\" in blue.\n\n**Clear commitment to social responsibility:** \n\nSustainability is a mainstay of our corporate strategy. The Instone Group supports EU and German federal government climate targets and aims to achieve CO2 neutrality by 2045. Overall, our aim is to be a sustainability pioneer in the sector. In 2023, the ESG rating agency Sustainalytics again ranked the Instone Group among the top 3% of global real estate developers.

Following a strong performance in the final quarter, the DAX recorded a total increase of 20.3%. It also achieved a new record high in December.\n\nThe markets were heavily influenced by the development of inflation and interest rates. The restrictive monetary policy adopted by international central banks as a result of the sudden increase in inflation led to ten consecutive increases in interest rates by the European Central Bank up to September 2023. Falling inflation then gave hope to market participants in the fourth quarter that interest rates had peaked and a relaxation of interest rate levels would follow. This was also the material driver behind the strong share price performance in the final quarter.\n\nOther material factors that affected the share price included the negative news in March from the financial sector in the USA and in Europe, though ultimately this news was managed. Geopolitical tension together with the resulting negative economic implications continued to weigh heavily on the markets in 2023. One of the major factors in this respect was the fear of a potential escalation of the Middle East conflict in Israel, which temporarily placed the markets under pressure in October but was followed by a strong recovery by the end of the year.\n\nAs the sector is sensitive to interest rates, there was a particular focus on real estate shares in discussions about interest rate developments. Faced with a high degree of fluctuation in share prices during the year, the benchmark index of German real estate shares EPRA/NAREIT Germany ultimately recorded a positive performance in 2023 of 27.7%, which means that it actually outshone the performance of the main DAX index.\n\nIn addition to the macro factors described above, the Instone Group share performance was also influenced by a number of negative news stories from the German residential developers sector, including major company insolvencies. Higher interest rates, which mainly subdues demand, but also has a negative effect on costs, combined with higher construction costs placed many of our competitors under severe pressure in 2023. Against this backdrop, Instone Group shares recorded a negative share price performance of 9.5% with a final Xetra price of €7.30. Shareholders received a dividend of €0.35 per share, which at the time of the ex-dividend date following the 2023 Annual General Meeting represented a dividend yield of 6.4%. This meant that overall Instone Group shares delivered only a slightly negative return over the full year of 2023. The share price reached a high of €9.62 on 2 February 2023 (source: Xetra closing price) and a low of €4.99 on 2 June 2023. The Instone Group market capitalisation at the end of the year was €343 million (previous year: €379 million).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n**[Shares](#page-31-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Share price performance from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023**\n\nIndexed, 31/12/2022 = 100% Historical prices (Xetra closing prices)\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/17 description: The image is a line graph comparing the performance of three different indices over time.

Its shares are listed on Deutsche Börse's Prime Standard index. The Instone Group develops residential buildings and apartment complexes and additionally operates in the publicly subsidised residential construction sector. It also works on contemporary urban planning and the refurbishment of listed buildings. These are marketed to owner-occupiers, retail buy-to-let investors and institutional investors. The Company has 441 employees across nine locations in Germany. As at 31 December 2023, the project portfolio of the Instone Group included 45 development projects with an anticipated gross development value of approximately €7.0 billion and 14,252 unit[s. GRI 2-7](#page-286-0) \n\nAround 87.6% of the development portfolio (based on the expected sales volume after completion of the development) is traditionally focused on the most important metropolitan regions of Germany (Berlin, Cologne/Bonn, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt/Main, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich, Nuremberg and\n\nStuttgart. Around 12.4% of the projects are located in other prospering medium-sized cities. Well-connected suburbs and medium-sized cities in the metropolitan regions are becoming increasingly attractive and can thus help to meet the generally high demand for residential space.\n\nIn addition to its traditional core product – i.e. the individually planned and tailored development of homes for rental and homes for sale – the Instone Group also develops affordable newly built housing in the outskirts of metropolitan areas and in well-connected B- and C-tier cities under the brand name nyoo. In line with the Instone Group's strategy, the nyoo brand shall be developed into a key driver of medium-term growth for the company. With the help of Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, about half of all properties developed by the Instone Group will come from the \"affordable housing\" segment (see also the \"Strategy\" section on [page 42\\) a](#page-41-0)s early as 2030.\n\n#### **Coverage of the entire value chain**\n\nThe Instone Group is the only listed developer in Germany that exclusively focuses on residential real estate and also covers the entire value chain, figure 001. We offer a fully integrated platform across Germany that covers land acquisition, land development, concept planning and construction management through to marketing and sales.

In addition, the headquarters of the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, with currently 47 employees, is located in Cologne.\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/17 description: The image shows a map of Germany with several cities marked with a location pin. The cities marked are Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Essen, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Munich.\n\nWith regard to corporate management, the Instone Group implements an integrated risk management system and uses reporting and planning tools to minimise risk in the development process. As per German Broker and Developer Regulations (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung, MaBV), the company has the option of contractually agreeing to instalment payments based on the progress of construction for residential units sold to owner-occupiers or private investors, for example. Comparable financing arrangements are also frequently negotiated with institutional investors in this regard. This significantly reduces both the financing risk and the capital commitment for the Instone Group. Instone Real Estate Group SE acts as a strategic management holding company; the subsidiary Instone Real Estate Development GmbH is responsible for the operational project business with the traditional core product. The company Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, founded in 2019, is responsible for business concerning the new product of affordable housin[g. figure 002](#page-37-0)\n\n#### **Slight decrease in number of employees**\n\nAs part of the current crisis in the sector, we have increasingly focused on our costs and reduced our platform costs. This coincided with a decrease in the number of employees. On 31 December, 2023, the Instone Group employed a total of 441 people.

The market environment in the real estate sector has changed considerably. This is due to heavily rising inflation, which has also led to a substantial increase in building costs and, in particular, a markedly more restrictive monetary policy as a result of inflationary trends. Ultimately, the interest hikes implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) have also led to a historic rise in the ten-year mortgage rates in Germany. These rose from a very low level of less than 1.0% in 2021 to around 4.2% in autumn 2023. This had a significantly negative impact on demand from both private and institutional investors.\n\nDeclining demand for new housing has also already had a negative impact on supply. An expected decline in building completion rates will therefore further exacerbate the excess structural demand on the German residential property market, especially in light of the refugee crisis which has led to an additional increase in demand. On the other hand, the decline in construction activity has led to a certain easing of building costs, which have stabilised in the second half of 2023.\n\n#### **Competitive environment**\n\nIn a fragmented competitive environment, the Instone Group considers itself to be in a leading market position. There are few other project developers that operate across all of Germany and are therefore able to compete nationwide in the purchase of development projects. The competitive situation is instead characterised by smaller, more regional or local project developers.\n\nEspecially in the current industry crisis, which has led to more real estate developers facing insolvency, the Instone Group benefits from its financial strength, which is evident in its very low leverage ratio and high liquidity. This is a key distinguishing factor, especially in a competitive environment characterised by numerous regional providers with limited financial resources. In a difficult financing environment, the Instone Group continues to enjoy unrestricted access to new sources of financing, as confirmed by the issue of a new promissory note loan in the final quarter, for example. We believe that our financial strength is one of the important selling points for our customers and subcontractors, and enables us to capitalise on project acquisition opportunities as soon as the market stabilises.\n\nFurther information on the development of the German residential real estate market over the past financial year can be found in the \"Economic framework\" section starting o[n page 129.](#page-128-0) \n\n#### **Political and regulatory framework**\n\nReal estate development is affected by a number of factors, including the political environment, the regulatory framework and general public acceptance. The housing market has increasingly been the focus of political debate and public discussion in recent years. This is due primarily to the persistently high level of demand for housing driven by demographic change and migration both into Germany and in particular within Germany. Given the relatively low level of new construction activity, these factors are leading to a sustained shortage of housing in the metropolitan areas.\n\nWe believe that the Instone Group has a joint responsibility alongside policy-makers and local authorities to focus on finding solutions to this excess demand, and the main way we can play our part is by creating housing that is both liveable and affordable. The Instone Group is closely and continuously monitoring the shifting regulatory framework and aligning its business activities with the new legislation. We are engaging in a close dialogue with state and local authorities to actively help improve the framework for the creation of housing. To achieve this objective, Management Board Chair Kruno Crepulja is, for instance, Vice Chair of the Residential Real Estate Committee for ZIA Zentraler Immobilien Ausschuss e. V. (German Property Federation), the umbrella organisation of the real estate industry in Germany.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWhen considering the regulatory environment, it is also important to note that it is the balancing of residents' individual interests and the common good within re-densification projects for markets with housing shortages that is increasingly leading to project delays or cancellations. The growing importance of environmental concerns also further complicates the procurement of planning permission. Nevertheless, it is worth noting at present that most Instone Group projects are supported by the public. In our view, this is underpinned by active and transparent communication and high levels of credibility. In development planning processes, the Instone Group maintains open communications and involves all affected stakeholders, such as neighbours and interested citizens, in the planning of the neighbourhoods at an early stage, which results in comparatively few conflicts and minimal associated public law proceedings.\n\nThe Instone Group itself meets its obligations under urban development contracts with local authorities as an integral part of the value chain. Our current projects include the creation of crèche places for 1,759 children and affordable housing in locations with major shortages, amounting to 2,610 subsidised homes or 84 reduced-price homes.\n\nSignificant changes currently affecting the regulatory environment or uncertainty factors that could affect the Instone Group's business model are described below.\n\n#### **Federal government subsidy policy**\n\nGermany's current coalition government has described the creation of new housing to be a key political goal and has established a separate Federal Ministry of Construction for this purpose. The main objective is the construction of 400,000 new units per year, 100,000 of which will be publicly subsidised. However, the number of newly constructed units continued to fall well short of this target in 2023 and even building completion rates are in decline. This is due to poorer overall conditions coupled with rapidly rising loan interest rates and building costs and general macroeconomic risks, in addition to ongoing uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework.\n\nNew subsidies for climate-friendly new builds and the creation of residential property worth €1.1 billion have been launched for 2023. This is a comparatively low volume. Around €350 million of this has been made available to help families own a home (\"Residential Property for Families\", or \"Wohneigentum für Familien\" programme), which was intended to replace the government's Baukindergeld grant programme, which\n\nexpired in late 2022. The new programme will only provide funding for new buildings in Germany intended for owner occupancy that meet the Efficiency House 40 Plus (EH 40) standard. Families with at least one under-age child and a maximum annual taxable household income of €60,000 were eligible to apply. This income limit was raised to €90,000 on 16 October 2023. This limit increases by €10,000 for each additional under-age child. However, families that have already received federal funding for residential property in the past, such as through the former grant scheme, are ineligible. The subsidy system is based on the granting of low-interest KfW loans, which, however, can be used as a replacement for equity. Depending on the number of children and proof of a Sustainable Building Quality (QNG) seal, the maximum subsidy was between €170,000 and €270,000.\n\nAround €750 million was also earmarked to subsidise the construction of new climate-friendly rentals under the \"Climate-friendly new housing\" programme. This programme was aimed at housing groups and cooperatives as well as private developers. To receive funding, the building had to meet the Efficiency House 40 (EH 40) standard and may not use fossil fuels to generate heat. Additional funding was possible by obtaining a QNG certificate for sustainable buildings. This subsidy was also based on the granting of low-interest loans. The programme was terminated early in December 2023 as the funding was used up. The maximum subsidy per unit was €100,000–€150,000.\n\nThe federal government also enacted tax relief for property owners on 1 January 2023. The linear depreciation rate for leased residential building construction is slated to be increased from 2% to 3%, thus shortening the depreciation period from 50 to 33 years. This should help support a campaign of climate-friendly new construction. For a limited time, a special depreciation allowance shall also be put in place under which 5% of manufacturing costs can be deducted as depreciation within four years. These costs are limited to €4,800 per square metre, of which no more than €2,500 per square metre can be claimed for tax purposes. This tax benefit requires the building to meet the Efficiency House 40 standard and have a QNG seal.\n\nAs part of its planned introduction of the new Growth Opportunities Act, the federal government's plans included subsidising new construction by introducing a declining annual depreciation rate of 6% and thus increasing the linear depreciation rate of 3% introduced on 1 January 2023, on 1 October 2023. Federal Council approval, which is required to introduce the act, had not been given by the balance sheet date.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **German Building Land Mobilisation Act implemented at federal state level**\n\nThe Building Land Mobilisation Act, which came into force in mid-2021, has since been implemented to varying degrees in the individual federal states. While Baden-Württemberg, for example, primarily introduced a municipal pre-emptive right to undeveloped land in certain municipalities, Hamburg and Berlin also decided to reserve the right to approve conversion of rental apartments into private property (Section 250 of the German Building Code (BauGB)).\n\nIn the real estate sector, the Building Land Mobilisation Act is seen as a drastic market intervention and encroachment on property rights, which is expected to result in a long-term reduction in supply for purchasers of owner-occupied housing. Thanks to the municipal pre-emptive right, local authorities have more opportunities to gain preferential access to land and housing and to build houses there themselves. The growing use of municipal pre-emptive rights can therefore also influence the acquisition activities of private developers. The generally limited financial flexibility for many local authorities significantly limits their acquisition potential.\n\nHowever, the Instone Group also believes that additional opportunities may emerge through public sector collaborations if pre-emptive purchase rights are exercised more frequently.\n\n#### **Municipal land regulations**\n\nIn recent years, political efforts have been made in a number of the Instone Group's core markets to further extend regulations as part of the creation of new planning permissions. As well as increases in mandatory quotas for the creation of subsidised housing, there are also initiatives to regulate privately financed residential construction more heavily at local authority level, for example by using fixed quotas for homes for sale, homes for rent, reduced-rent housing or cooperative housing.\n\nWhile additional regulations of this type are likely to have negative effects on both the demand for and supply of building land in general, the Instone Group believes it is well positioned to compete in this environment thanks to the development of a product for affordable housing. With our expertise in products and implementation in the area of low-cost construction, our assessment is that we are further strengthening our relative competitive position compared to other developers. Furthermore, current projects with planning permission and projects for which the process of procuring planning permission has already started are not affected by these requirements.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n### **Strateg**\n\nImage /page/41/Figure/9 description: The image shows a combined management report with a list of topics on the left and a diagram on the right.

With nyoo, we are also addressing B- and C-tier locations in the vicinity of economic hubs, which are becoming increasingly attractive. With our projects, we also constantly focus on sustainable, climate-friendly neighbourhood development and the incorporation of social aspects, including the provision of subsidised housing and housing with improved accessibility. Neighbourhood developments consist of a mix of residential units supplemented by other usage categories, such as offices, commercial spaces and community facilities, for example child day-care centres. For a larger proportion of non-residential developments, we take on land development and typically include project partners for the commercial part. With regard to the project sizes, we concentrate on large projects with an average value of around €100 million with our traditional product. In contrast, the average project size for nyoo is around €30–50 million.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Growth driver nyoo for affordable housing\n\nWith our product to create affordable housing, nyoo, we are supplementing our current product range with high-quality, low-cost housing based on modular planning. By combining modular planning, serial construction and streamlined products, we are planning to significantly reduce production costs and project durations. The cost advantages achieved with this product allow the Instone Group to develop a market in the mid-price segment with high growth potential, allowing us to meet the high demand for housing from middle income groups while also making a valuable contribution to providing affordable housing near metropolitan areas as well as in B-tier and C-tier cities, which we consider to be attractive. By 2030, around half of our developed homes will be in the affordable housing category.\n\n#### Project pipeline expansion\n\nThe acquisition of suitable land is essential if the Instone Group is to grow as planned. As early as the 2022 financial year, we significantly scaled back our acquisitions as the market began to experience a downturn, and ultimately abstained from any new project acquisitions in 2023, thus shifting our short-term focus to strengthening the balance sheet. However, we assume that we will be able to benefit from opportunities for land acquisition or projects already at an advanced stage in the current environment in 2024. We plan to resume acquisitions as soon as demand stabilises further. In the medium-term, we plan to again expand our project portfolio in terms of both traditional business and our product for affordable housing, nyoo. The strong key balance sheet figures in the view of the Management Board also lead us to believe that the Instone Group is well positioned to achieve further growth.\n\n#### Making the most of competitive advantages along the value chain\n\nAs one of the few developers in Germany focusing on residential real estate, the Instone Group has many years of extensive expertise along the entire value chain:\n\n- → When acquiring land, we prioritise \"off-market transactions\", i.e. acquisitions outside the multi-stage public bidding process. Establishing networks over the long-term represents an important success factor in opening up attractive buying opportunities.\n- → When making acquisitions, we prioritise land that has no planning permission in order to harness the increased potential for added value. The Instone Group brings its experience to acquiring economically attractive planning permission.\n- → The Group helps local authorities to acquire planning permission, in particular by developing urban planning strategies and proposals for action, and to draft land use and development plans.\n- → In the vast majority of cases, we act as our own general contractor. Contracts are individually awarded to regional and national construction companies from our existing network based on relevant selection criteria. These criteria include the company's experience with comparable projects, the technical requirements and the level of quality required.\n- → Direct access to subcontractors gives us a competitive advantage, especially when contractors are working at near-full capacity. This makes it possible to ensure building capacity early on and to provide a high level of cost transparency. The value created internally has a positive overall effect on our operating margin.\n- → In marketing and sales, we maximise our access to all relevant target groups, such as owner-occupiers, capital investors and institutional investors.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Exploiting efficiency gains through digitalisation\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nFor the Instone Group, greater digitalisation of business processes is a critical factor in further increasing efficiency and a key competitive advantage in a highly fragmented industry with relatively little digitalisation. By continuously digitalising and analysing all of our processes, we can routinely identify potential areas for improvement and thus make our planning and construction processes more efficient in the long-term. As a result, we are working on the uniform digitalisation of our entire process landscape with proprietary software, allowing us to create an integrated planning and construction process that can make the best use of the opportunities presented by serial construction.\n\n#### Leading the way in sustainability\n\nFair and responsible action with regard to economic, environmental and social sustainability is a core component of the Instone Group strategy. We firmly believe that our company's sustainability performance is crucial to our long-term economic success and competitiveness. The fact that we are taking a pioneering role in this is confirmed by specialised sustainability rating agency, Sustainalytics. In its 2023 analysis, it ranked the Instone Group among the top 3% of real estate developers of a total of 288 companies studied worldwide. One way in which we managed to further implement our strategy in the past financial year was by establishing in-house impact groups of around 30 employees each. These groups work intensively on the operational implementation and integration of sustainable materials, neighbourhood infrastructure and important social aspects in our neighbourhoods, for example[.

This is an important success component for further strengthening the Instone Group's competitive position.\n\nIts internal corporate management is, in particular, based on the following elements:\n\n- → Integrated management information system\n- → Database-supported project management\n- → Structured meeting system\n- → Financial and real estate business key performance indicators\n- → Group-wide risk management\n\n#### Integrated management information system\n\nThe integrated management information system (MIS) supports all management levels during planning and decision-making processes. One material element is our \"bottom-up\" business planning which views the specific factors influencing property from a financial perspective.\n\nThe reporting system for the presentation of key developments relating to the real estate and financial key performance indicators is compiled on a monthly basis, supplemented by a consideration of the key project milestones and the development of liquidity.\n\n#### Database-supported project management\n\nWithin the scope of its project management, the Instone Group relies on a database-supported planning and reporting system that is integrated into the wider system landscape. This supports the individual process steps for the monthly preparation of project forecasts and updates. It also serves as a central database for both operational level and higher-level corporate controlling. This makes it possible to identify potential and the need for action resulting from the updated project forecasts at an early stage with the support of tools.\n\n#### Structured meeting system\n\nThe targeted exchange of information from the project teams up to Management Board level is an integral part of the Instone Group's corporate management system. These include, among other things, the monthly project team and results meetings in the branches as well as the discussions with the Management Board regarding the status of the projects.\n\n→ Group-wide risk management\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Corporate governance key performance indicators**\n\n#### **Financial and real estate business key performance indicators**\n\n#### Important corporate governance key performance indicators\n\nFor governance of our sustainable economic success, we use the profitbased key performance indicators (KPIs) of adjusted revenue, adjusted gross profit margin and adjusted earnings after tax (EAT) as financial performance indicators and the real estate business key performance indicator of volume of sales contracts as a non-financial performance indicator.\n\n#### **Adjusted revenue**\n\nThe key indicator for the performance of the Instone Group is adjusted revenue. Thanks to the application of period-based revenue recognition in almost all project developments in the Instone Group, adjusted revenues represent a key indicator for assessing the performance of the Company which is sufficient in our view. The adjusted revenue recognition similarly includes share deals and asset deals in analogous application of IFRS 15 in the determination, regardless of the decision of IFRS IC to exclude share deals from the revenue recognition over time under IFRS 15. In addition, adjusted revenue recognition is calculated without the effects from purchase price allocations.\n\n#### **Adjusted gross profit margin**\n\nAdjusted gross profit is determined from the adjusted revenue less cost of materials, changes in inventories, material-costs related other operating income, indirect sales costs and capitalised interest, but without considering the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals. The adjusted gross profit margin as a ratio of adjusted gross profit to adjusted revenues reflects the operating result after deducting all external costs that can be directly attributed to the project and places the focus on the projects' profitability.\n\n#### **Adjusted earnings after tax**\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax is calculated on the basis of adjusted gross profit less platform costs, consisting of staff costs, other operating income and expenses, depreciation and amortisation, investment and other income, financial result and income taxes, but is also adjusted for the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals, as well as any non-recurring effects, where applicable.\n\nIn particular, the following significant expenses are adjusted for disposal losses from sales of tangible or financial assets or securities, unscheduled depreciation and amortisation of tangible and financial assets, one-off expenses relating to the valuation of inventories, costs for acquisitions, merger losses, contractual penalties, demands for additional taxes from previous years based on audits, severance payments to the Management Board, and personnel reductions and restructuring to a greater extent, if these do not meet the strict criteria set out in IAS 37. The adjustment of material income includes, in particular, income from capital gains arising from sales of non-current assets, compensation for damages, writeups on non-current assets, refunds of taxes from previous years based on audits, reversals of provisions for extraordinary events and merger gains.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-49-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Business model and strategy**\n\n[TCFD risk management](#page-289-0) \n\n#### Business model ( )\n\nDetailed information on the business model is presented in the section \"Foundations of the Group[\" page 36.

TCFD governance](#page-289-0)\n\n#### Equity story\n\nThe equity story of the Instone Group is based on the realisation of futureoriented residential property projects. With this approach, the Instone Group continues – even in a difficult environment – to make an important contribution to easing the shortage of affordable housing in Germany. Further information on the equity story can be found o[n page 30.](#page-29-0) \n\n#### Strategy in the context of sustainability\n\nThe Company's primary goal is to position itself as a leading neighbourhood developer in sustainability and social impact. The Instone Group pursues its sustainability goals at both the corporate and project level.\n\nAn important step in the strategic orientation of the Instone Group towards sustainability is also manifested in the further increased prioritisation of this topic by the Management Board of the Instone Group. This can be seen, for example, in the structural adjustments and further developments of our corporate organisation, which are closely supported by the Chairman of the Management Board, as a result of which the topic of sustainability is even more closely interlinked with the overall business strategy.\n\nFor the Instone Group, transparency and communication regarding key strategic goals for sustainability are not only an obligation to stakeholders but also an essential tool for building trust and maintaining an open dialogue with partners. This is why the Instone Group is proactively taking steps to bring its reporting in line with the CSRD/ESRS. In order to meet the ambitious requirements of the CSRD/ESRS, it is necessary to embed sustainability aspects in all relevant processes and practical operations. The inclusion of every single employee is essential to accomplish this.\n\nA crucial step in this transformation was to establish five Group-wide working groups, consisting of 30 employees from the various operations areas of the Company (e.g., project management, project development) and with diverse skills (see graphi[c page 4\\). S](#page-3-0)ince the end of 2022, these working groups have been working hard to operationalise our sustainability goals and establish them in practice. The working groups' specific goals are derived from the topics the Instone Group identified in its materiality analysis. They develop proposals for practical solutions and create guidelines for the Instone Group's future operations. After spending the last few years focussing on data availability and analysis, the previous year was spent optimising systematic and electronic data collection processes as well as comprehensive data analysis to build the foundation for further optimisation and critical decision-making for construction projects.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n- **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n- [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **The working groups focus on the following:**\n\n- **Sustainable building** Focus: Sustainable building materials and resource-optimised planning\n\t- **Hybrid timber** focus: timber as construction material\n- **Neighbourhood infrastructure** focus: energy, mobility and water management\n- **Neighbourhood impact**  Focus: social impact\n- **ESG inside** focus: Instone Group Work Environment Office and Construction Site\n\nThe results of each of the working groups are integrated into the Instone Group's material sustainability topics. One example of this is the \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group's close examination of heating systems. An efficiently planned heating system can help reduce operating emissions.\n\nThe project members are seen as the experts at the Instone Group and act as Group-wide sustainability ambassadors. All employees are invited to get involved in the process and offer suggestions.\n\nFurther details on work results can be found in the sections on the respective sustainability topics.\n\nSustainability is increasingly becoming an integral part of every link in our value chain, with the most emphasis placed on taking a holistic approach to the life cycle of a property. From the choice of construction materials and the construction process to the eventual operation – every phase is scrutinised in terms of sustainability. This comprehensive approach provides a holistic view of the environmental footprint of our real estate projects.\n\nAside from environmental aspects, the Instone Group takes into account both social and economic factors. An example of this is the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. Our subsidiary nyoo has set itself the goal of building with mass-produced and inexpensive components, making its product accessible to as many people as possible. The inclusion of all three sustainability dimensions can be seen in other areas as well, such as in the design of our projects (see also the section \"Cities/communities[\" page 112\\).](#page-111-0)  The cost-effectiveness of sustainable building methods and practices is seen not just as a goal in itself but as an integral part of our responsibility towards our investors and the economy.\n\n#### Value chain\n\nDetailed information on the Instone Group's value chain is provided in the section \"Foundations of the Group[\" page 36.](#page-35-0)\n\n#### Table of targets\n\n [table 004 p](#page-58-0)rovides an overview of our sustainability goals – all annotations are addressed and explained further in the subsections covering the environment, social matters and governance.\n\n#### Materiality analysis\n\n[TCFD risk management/metrics and targets](#page-289-0) \n\n#### Procedure ( )\n\nIn order to identify sustainability topics relevant to the Instone Group's business activities and stakeholders, the materiality analysis was redesigned and conducted in the financial year 2022. Since, after conferring with the Management Board, there have been no material changes either in the state of affairs or to the business activities of the Instone Group in 2023, this materiality analysis forms the basis for the sustainability topics reported. In preparation for the CSRD, the following financial year will see the re-identification and examination of material sustainability topics as part of a comprehensive materiality analysis based on the now-final ESRS requirements and the implementation guidance of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG).1\n\n<sup>1</sup> The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is a non-profit organisation that assists the European Commission with the application of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to EU accounting. In 2023, the EFRAG published the first three drafts of its implementation guidance for the ESRS.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group's underlying materiality analysis meets the requirements of Germany's CSRD Implementation Act (CSR-RUG) and HGB. The Instone Group is also guided by the GRI's requirements and the CSRD's/ESRS's definition/understanding of double materiality.\n\nThe following are therefore considered to be material:\n\n- Topics that have a material influence on or involve a material risk for the Company, its value or its activities (financial materiality) and/or <sup>2</sup>\n- Activities that cause the Company to have a material influence on its environment **(impact materiality).**\n\nThe assessment of which topics are material to the Instone Group from these two perspectives takes the form of a survey of representative internal key account managers concerning the positions of the following stakeholder groups: banks, investors, municipalities, associations and NGOs, employees and clients. Alongside the evaluations of the stakeholders' representatives, the findings of the Sustainability Department were taken into consideration as an additional group in the evaluation process.\n\nThe impact is assessed by evaluating three parameters:\n\n- 1. Scale: How important is the impact?\n- 2. Scope: Does the impact relate to the entire company or only to specific areas?\n- 3. Remediability: How easily can a negative impact be mitigated?\n\nThe financial materiality is assessed by means of the following three parameters:\n\n- 1. Scale: How significant is the financial risk?\n- 2. Scope: Does the financial risk relate to the entire company or only to specific areas?\n- 3. Remediability: How easily can a financial risk be mitigated?\n\nAll three parameters are given a score between zero and five using a manual assessment process. The final result of the evaluation of impact materiality and the financial materiality of a theme is the total of the parameters. The general procedure for the materiality analysis at the Instone Group can be found in the following graph (last performed in 2022). All key issues are monitored by the Sustainability Department on an ongoing basis (see also Risk Management, Due Diligence and Internal Control Syste[m page 124\\).](#page-123-0) [GRI 3, 3-1, 3-3](#page-287-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> Topics identified as material as defined in Section 289c (3) HGB.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Material topics under the CSRD and the ESRS that will be mandatory for the Instone Group starting with the annual report 2025.

collected, consolidated and analysed data on environmental topics such as climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity and resource management. In the following sections, all topics identified as having at least single materiality are categorised into the appropriate areas.\n\n### **Climate change**\n\n- **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION**\n\t-\n\t-\n- \n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality ( )\n\nClimate change has been evaluated as material from the financial and impact perspectives. This is reflected in the assessment of the topics \"CO₂ emissions from building operations\" (E3), \"CO₂ emissions from building manufacture\" (E4) and \"Energy consumption and intensity\" (E13) as having double materiality. Climate change affects all strategic business decisions, such as the selection of the location of new projects, the choice of materials and design in the planning phase and the selection of heating systems for the buildings.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Instone Group announced its new climate strategy, which forms part of its sustainability strategy. This included the publication of the Company's long-term climate target: achieving net zero emissions along its entire value chain by 2045. The Instone Group also set a medium-term target of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 and has had this validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In addition, the medium-term target for scope 3 is currently being expanded. Work to develop appropriate action plans is continuing and validation by the SBTi will be accelerated in the coming years.\n\nTo identify the transition and physical risks and opportunities involved in the recommendations of the Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the climate scenario analysis that was redesigned in 2022 was updated in the financial year 2023. In addition, the work on incorporating and implementing the climate strategy as part of the general business strategy continued.\n\nAt the Instone Group, scope 1 comprises the company car fleet emissions, while scope 2 is based on electricity and heat consumption by offices and branches as well as electricity consumed at construction sites. Our Scope 3 emissions comprise those generated during the various life cycle phases of a building, such as the manufacture of building materials, as well as use and disposal. Our Scope 3 emissions also include those caused directly by the Instone Group, including business travel, employee commutes and emissions from buildings leased before project start.

gas (GHG) emissions are recorded based on a standard internal process. For Scope 3, this includes both the overall perspective and the life cycle perspective; for Scopes 1 to 3, this comprises all energy consumed as part of our business activities, which ensures all the impacts of our activities are covered.1\n\nOver the past year, the ESG Inside working group has developed a package of measures to reduce energy consumption in offices and at construction sites. Among other things, the group conducted a company-wide survey and interviews in order to gather as many opinions as possible and to generate ideas. The results form the basis for the further implementation of tangible measures.\n\nGHG emissions reporting for projects is shared within the organisation, so not just employees from the Sustainability Department but also employees from Project Service collect data and contribute to the consolidation work. Employees have been trained in the life cycle analysis software used for this reporting. Thanks to an increase in personnel capacity, data collection for initial projects is now carried out at an early planning phase. This means that potential optimisation options, such as alternative designs, can be assessed and compared at an early stage of the planning process. The Controlling Department's project management software is already able to retrieve the data on the average annual output of solar power systems/photovoltaics in projects, for example, internally. Retrieval is currently being expanded (SDM project) to include emissions and energy consumption, for instance for other climate-related key figures, and will soon be an integral part of the Instone Group's key figures system. Property-related aspects such as energy consumption and energy management systems have a significant impact on the recording of GHG emissions (especially Scopes 2 and 3) and thus are collected together.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The GHG emissions that we produce are divided up using two different approaches. On the one hand, we use the standard classification according to Scope 1, 2 and 3 as described in the GHG Protocol. From this perspective, the overall perspective, the emissions are recorded in the year they are produced. The downstream scope 3 emissions of products that have been sold are an exception. They are fully reported once they are sold in the year when they are handed over. In our case, this means that the emissions from the entire use phase (around 50 years) and the dismantling of the buildings which we completed in the financial year 2023 will be recorded in the same year. The life cycle perspective, the second method of presenting the data used in this report, assigns all the emissions from all the completed buildings in the reporting period to the relevant life cycle phases (manufacture, use, disposal). This allows us to distinguish between the operational emissions that result from energy consumption in the use of buildings (operational carbon) and the grey emissions that make up all the other emissions in the life cycle of a building (embodied carbon).\n\nIn terms of target attainment, the sum of GHG emissions from Scopes 1 and 2, which make up 0.5% of total emissions, fell by 46.1% absolute compared to the base year 2020 and by 61.5% in terms of GHG intensity/m<sup>2</sup> compared to the base year 2020. This means that, last year, the Instone Group (more than) met its SBTi-validated target for annual reductions, which involves decarbonising in accordance with the 1.5°C pathwa[y; figure006. T](#page-72-0)he Scope 2 improvements were mainly achieved by gradually switching offices and construction sites to green energy. The ongoing replacement of fleet vehicles with more fuel-efficient as well as electric models had further positive effects on scope 1 emissions. The measures listed below have the potential to reduce energy consumption and Scope 1 and 2 emissions next year as well.\n\nIn addition to the Scope 3 emissions from the project development process, there are emissions from travel and employee commuting, which make up around 0.1% of Scope 3 emissions. These emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the previous year, which is mainly due to the increased use of rail as the mode of transportation. The lower number of employees also resulted in lower emissions from commuting.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **Projected versus actual climate targets FIGURE 006**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n```\nRisk and \nopportunities report\n```\nGroup\nort\nCO₂e int\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nAt least -42% in une with\nthe SBTI-1.5°C scenario\n\nAlready achieved reduction\nfor Scope 1 and 2 emissions:\n-46.1%\n\n1.5°C path\n\nConstruction scenario\n\nClimate protection scenario\n\nLong\nClima\nin Sco\nand 3\n\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n\n<sup>3</sup> Climate change mitigation scenario: This calculation for scope 2 is based on the assumption that decarbonising the energy sector achieves climate neutrality in 2045 (based on Agora et al., 2021).\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The course of Scopes 1 and 2 is based on projects involving planned measures, taking planned growth into account.\n\n2 BAU scenario: This calculation for Scope 2 is based on the assumption that decarbonising the energy sector is only progressing moderately (in accordance with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, 2021).\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>C\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/20 description: This image is a line graph showing CO2e int emissions from 2020 to 2030.

This is based on a calculatory approach, which assumes that the construction phase lasts two years until the completion of the individual building. In the second year, emissions from the construction phase and all emissions from the use and disposal phases are recorded in the Scope 3 calculation. The comparison of Scope 3 emissions revealed a reduction in GHG intensity of 5.9% compared to the previous year (2022). This reduction can be attributed, among other things, to a reduction in the completed project area and thus to a reduction in emissions. The measures intended to help reduce scope 3 emissions in the medium and long term will only produce measurable effects in the coming years.\n\n#### EXCURSUS: In focus – Scope 3 emissions: Analyses and concrete examples from the Instone Group\n\nIn addition to creating cross-departmental working groups, another part of the refinement of our approach to reducing Scope 3 emissions and achieving our target of net zero emissions entails the analysis and comparison of the potential pathways for Scope 3 emissions. Here, we focused in particular on completed building[s. figure 007 s](#page-74-0)hows an example of the emissions reduction requirements for achieving our net zero target in accordance with the specifications of the SBTi. The information from the emission sources in the building's upstream and downstream value chain, from the perspective of the Instone Group as the project developer, and the technological options in the life cycle phases of the building were included in the process of identifying the requirements. This means that the selection of energy sources for the buildings developed by the Instone Group in the planning phase is directly connected to the reduction of GHG emissions. The process of recording the building information in the life cycle analysis software includes identifying energy sources, energy consumption and energy intensity.<sup>1</sup> This allows different energy concepts for individual projects to be compared and assessed. The results are reviewed and discussed by the operational working group focussed on \"Energy\". However, it must be assumed that the emissions in the use phase, for example, can be reduced more quickly than those in the manufacturing phase in the period up to 2030 because technologies and other measures that will deliver significant decarbonisation in the production of materials are only expected to become available after 2030. By contrast, the use phase is dependent on the energy sources used to provide heating and electricity. To achieve a substantial reduction in the emissions in the use phase by 2030, project developers are partly dependent on the pace of the expansion of renewable energies in the power grid and of centralised\n\nheating sources such as renewable district heating. In winter 2022, a project was begun to deduce what are known as marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). This work was continued in 2023 and applied to a specific project.\n\nA specific project was chosen as a usage example because the planning phase examined a total of three energy sources (pellet heating, cogeneration, heating pump with photovoltaic system) for the heat source and calculated project-specific investment costs. This information, combined with scientific information on the average emissions of the energy sources as well as operating, maintenance and consumption costs, allowed these energy sources to be compared in terms of emissions and potential costs over an assumed life cycle of 20 years. The results show that although the heating pump with photovoltaic system that was ultimately chosen had higher costs than the other energy sources, its use resulted in considerably lower emissions. However, this is only the case if it can be assumed that the heating pump is supplied exclusively with electricity from the photovoltaic system as well as electricity from renewable sources supplied by local utilities and not from Germany's general electricity mix (see comparison of two heating pump options).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FIGURE 008**\n\n#### <span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n- **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Comparison of the CO2 emissions of the heating systems in the application project FIGURE 007**\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/17 description: The image contains the title \"Comparison of the costs of thermal energy sources in the application project\".\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/18 description: This bar chart compares the costs of different heating systems.

This is assumed to be equally weighted with electricity from wind offshore, wind onshore and hydropower and calculated accordingly.\n\nIn addition, another analysis of scope 3 emissions in the use phase was conducted in the previous year to assess how various energy sources could potentially contribute to a scope 3 target. This analysis was performed by calculating how much the most relevant energy sources could reduce emissions and simulating the percentages of the portfolio that would have to be reached to achieve this internal target. The findings from the MACCs and projected trends, such as the change in emissions intensity in the electrical and district heating grids, were also factored in. This trend is based on information from the Fraunhofer Institute, which was compiled as part of a study commissioned by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on reaching climate neutrality by 2045.\n\nThe analysis based on this data showed that reaching climate neutrality by 2045 remains challenging even under very favourable assumptions and with an optimised portfolio of heating sources. The possible emissions reduction for the use phase could range between 35% and 58% by 2030, whilst a reduction of 59% compared to 2022 would be needed to reach the reduction benchmark of the 1.5°C pathway. We could expect a reduction of 47% to 86% by 2045, though this would not reach the necessary 97% of the benchmark. These reduction ranges include the reduction potential of possible changes to the heating and electrical grids as well as possible changes in the Instone Group's portfolio with regard to the use of heating sources.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FIGURE 010**\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n-35%\n-47%\n100\n-58%\n-59%\n50\n\n-86%\n-97%\n0\n2022 2025 2030 2035 2040\nYears\n\nPortfolio: Instone 2023/stagnation scenario\nPortfolio: district heating/climate change mitigation\nUse phase reduction benchmark (1.5°C pathway)\n\n**Possible CO2 reductions due to changes in energy networks and adjustments in portfolio shares**\n\nBoth the use of various energy sources in a specific project and the analysis of various future developments in the energy grids combined with various portfolio strategies paint a similar picture. When it comes to reducing Scope 3 emissions, the Instone Group is heavily dependent upon other industries, such as the energy industry and its emissions reduction efforts.\n\nOther analyses will be conducted in the coming year to investigate the effects of the analysis results on a possible Scope 3 emissions target. This will include monitoring of both the tense situation in the construction industry as well as the political situation in which renewable energies are not being developed at a sufficient rate and climate change mitigation subsidies are being questioned, with a view to defining appropriate measures. These analyses will also support our efforts to define measures that facilitate the setting and attainment of a scope 3 target.\n\nThe examination of the manufacturing phase is currently on hold as there is little concrete information available to quantify material emissions reductions.<sup>1</sup> The Instone Group expects that information will soon be available; however, scalable technologies for reducing GHG emissions (specifically in trades such as concrete, cement and steel) in the use phase will only be available starting in the 2030s (German Environment Agency, 2020).\n\n**Scenario for a potential Scope 3 net zero pathway for the completed buildings of the Instone Group (base year 2020)1**\n\n**FIGURE 009**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/20 description: This image shows a graph titled \"Scope 3 emissions target curve based on SBTI\".

The results again include specific quantitative calculations relating to cost, revenue and profitability. These were calculated factoring in market changes, regulations and changes in energy prices. The source of the scenarios – the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – was augmented where necessary with current material prices, macroeconomic data and internal information (detailed description of the scenarios and procedure in the annual report 2022).\n\nThe following results showed no significant changes from the previous year. All the scenarios include much higher increases in the costs of energy and emissions from 2023 to 2030 compared with the period between 2030 and 2050. In the 1.5°C scenario, this is due primarily to the energy sector's transition to a larger proportion of renewable energies and a faster phaseout of fossil fuels, including gas, which is reflected in a rapid rise in energy\n\nprices. From 2030 onwards, energy prices in particular will stabilise, while the CO₂ price will continue to increase slightly.\n\nThe 2.6°C scenario is based on a lower level of transformation activity, with a less dramatic rise in energy prices primarily as a result of the expansion of gas and, to some extent, renewable energies in response to the current energy crisis. Fossil fuels will remain in the energy mix in the long term. The CO₂ price will remain at a level that has no impact on our activities.\n\nUsing the scenario assumptions, we were able to develop chains consisting of drivers of climate risks and climate opportunities for business activities and for the upstream and downstream value chain in terms of both costs and revenue.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity assessment for manufacturing costs in the 1.5°C

information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Employee diversity (S1 )**\n\nAt the Instone Group, diversity means forms of work in which different skills, talent, experience and beliefs can play a role. In line with the core elements of the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter) as well as the commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in compliance with the International Labour Standards of the ILO, the Instone Group is committed to the issues of diversity and respect for human rights and acts both within the Group and with contractual partners in accordance with these guidelines. In addition, vacancies are advertised and filled in accordance with the German General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). In this sense, the Instone Group is committed to always treating both applicants and employees equally, regardless of differences in age, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, religion, ideology or other characteristics.\n\nThe Instone Group endeavours to increase the percentage of women in leadership positions and uses targets as an instrument to promote gender equality. The current distribution and target rate of managers by gender can be found in [table 004. F](#page-61-0)urther information on the topic of diversity at the Supervisory Board and Management Board levels also can be found on [page 191. T](#page-190-0)he process of achieving this target is assessed through continual due diligence. The Management Board will next review the target rates for the first and second management levels under the Management Board as well as for the Board itself in 2025. Considering almost no vacancies were filled in the past year due to the economic situation, there have been hardly any changes in distribution compared to the previous year. The goal of organic employee growth, which could not be pursued in the reporting year due to the economic situation, remains in the long-term but must be revised for the financial year 2024. The target is to keep the number of employees at the current level.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the Instone Group established a working group from the HR and Communications Departments to conceptualise and refine the topic. The group's first step was to conduct a comparative analysis using the Diversity Charter. In addition, strategic considerations were made to continuously expand the diversity issue at the Instone Group. To this end, initial implementation ideas were exchanged and agreed in close coordination with the Management Board.\n\nThe Instone Group is laying the foundation with the establishment of the uniform management principles developed in 2022. The importance of employee diversity is addressed in this report. These principles also emphasise heterogeneous team structures, a variety of personalities and skills and the diverse strengths of employees as key success factors. With the implementation of the management principles, the Instone Group is creating a binding framework and enshrining the topic of diversity in the Company's culture. Responsibility for this lies with the HR Department in close coordination with the Management Board. [GRI 405](#page-288-0)\n\n#### **Work-life balance (S2)**\n\nDue to the increasing digitalisation of work processes, work environments can now also be outside the traditional office setting. As an attractive employer, the Instone Group normally offers employees the option of mobile working – working from any location – two days per week, though operations must maintain the necessary level of efficiency. The current works agreement governs the possibilities and conditions for mobile working whilst also protecting operational processes, ensuring the security of the company IT network and defining the precautions and preventive measures necessary for occupational health.\n\n#### **Employee satisfaction (S13)**  [GRI 202-2](#page-286-0)\n\nAside from recruiting skilled and junior personnel, employee loyalty is a chief concern and a strategic challenge in the face of the ongoing skills shortage. Employee satisfaction is a key lever in this regard. Risks may arise if key vacancies cannot be filled in a timely manner – or at all. Opportunities arise from redirecting skilled workers towards attractive and secure employers such as the Instone Group.\n\nOne approach to providing employees with personal development opportunities and retaining them more closely with the company is the internal mentoring programme. This supports young leaders at the Instone Group in finding their leadership role. In this programme, mentees are supported by experienced mentors over a period of two years. The programme also gives young managers the opportunity to grow their internal network and gain experience from various keynote speeches.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group also offers all employees an extensive training and professional development programme. In addition to the mandatory training on data protection, IT security and compliance (anti-corruption and competition law), employees have the opportunity to participate in professional training, soft skills training and individual training.\n\nThe Instone Group's good kununu<sup>1</sup> rating of 3.9 qualifies it as a top employer.<sup>2</sup> The annual employee survey showed a Group-wide participation rate of 72% in the 2023 financial year (previous year: 82%). The participation rate thus remained at a high level. However, the survey showed that employee satisfaction (very satisfied/satisfied) fell 28% to 47% (previous year: 75%). In the reporting year, more employees rated their satisfaction as neutral (34%). This can be explained by the changing market situation, the tense economic situation and the resulting high degree of uncertainty. Due to the challenging market conditions, planned adjustments to reduce platform costs were also implemented in the past year. As a result, the fluctuation rate in the reporting year was higher (16.0%) than in the previous year (9.3%). The average length of service, on the other hand, rose slightly to 7.3 years (previous year: 6.5 years[\\). GRI 401-1](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Instone Group enables young people to gain practical experience and take on responsibility early on. The Company employs a large number of interns and student trainees to give them an insight into the work of a project developer and to recruit them into a permanent position after graduation. In addition to a targeted induction plan devised by the relevant specialist department and the HR department, areas of responsibility are transferred gradually to new employees.\n\nThe \"New work\" trend is also gaining traction at the Instone Group. The digital workplace is an important step in the transformation into a modern work environment. We are digitising communication, tools, processes and information in a strategically effective way. This makes efficient, modern mobile working possible for employees.\n\nThe Instone Group is also keen to address the increasing importance of having a sense of purpose in the workplace. In implementing its corporate and sustainability strategy, the Instone Group is clearly demonstrating that it takes its responsibility seriously. The Instone Group is transparent in showing what solutions it is addressing in relation to social topics that are part of its business model, for example by establishing working groups to examine these topics. The sustainability strategy and related ambitions that the Instone Group has are taken into account when designing individual job profiles with their duties.\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety (S4)**\n\nThe Instone Group's external service provider for the topic of occupational health and safety is responsible for the identification and analysis of potential emergencies. Accident prevention is pursued through regular training, workplace and construction site inspections as well as (safety) instructions to increase the safety of employees, contractors and clients.\n\nTogether with the occupational safety service provider and the accident prevention and insurance association for the construction industry, it is ensured that all relevant legal requirements and internal guidelines are met. Instone Group construction sites are secured with temporary fencing surrounding the property. Debris netting, covered walkways and adequate lighting and signage are all monitored by security services where necessary. Safety officers in all areas of the Company support the occupational health and safety team.\n\n<sup>1</sup> https://inside.kununu.com/kununu-pruefprozess/ and https://inside.kununu.com/wie-kununu-datenverarbeitet/\n\n<sup>2</sup> Portal for applicants and employees to rate employers created by the social media network Xing.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe continuous monitoring and improvement of occupational health and safety as well as offers of programmes to promote health are all geared towards prevention. Employees were offered regular eye check-ups in the financial year 2023. In addition, a company-wide psychological risk assessment was carried out for the first time. The six core dimensions of work content, working time, social relations, work organisation, work environment and work equipment were examined. [GRI 403, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 403-8, 416, 416-1](#page-288-0)\n\n#### **Fair pay and remuneration (S10)**\n\nThe Instone Group's remuneration framework forms the basis for fair market value pay for employees. Accordingly, remuneration is determined by an employee's position, experience, responsibilities and work quality – and is non-discriminatory and performance-based. Comparisons of the last few years show that the differences caused by demographic factors are gradually levelling out. The Instone Group continues to make every effort to eliminate any and all unjustified differences in remuneration between employees. The Group bases the remuneration of its employees on the collective agreement for the construction industry, which also ensures that the conditions are in place for the statutory minimum wage and fair remuneration. In addition to the current works agreements, the commitment to the collective bargaining agreement forms the basis for a transparent salary structure.\n\n#### **Social dialogue/good working conditions (S12)**\n\nAs an employer, the Instone Group is not aware of employee membership or involvement in trade unions. At the Instone Group, there is a general works council at Group level and in the subsidiaries, plus employee representatives in the North-east (Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig), West (Essen, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main) and South (Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart) regions. Employees at all levels work on the basis of trust-based working time. Employees' supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the general occupational health and safety rules are followed. As part of a works agreement, each employee is given three days of time off in lieu per year scheduled by site.\n\nFeedback that employees wish to give regarding their work, duties or leadership can be noted in Management Board livestreams. Alternatively, the anonymous whistleblower contact option can be used. Over the past year, communication channels and interactions were expanded in order to remain in contact, particularly in these current challenging times. These include regular on-site visits and video messages by the Management Board to reach all employees as directly and simultaneously as possible as well as the set-up of an anonymous query tool so employees can submit questions at any time. These questions can then be addressed and answered in writing and/or in the Management Board livestream.\n\nTo promote internal and external social commitment, the Instone Group allocates at least one working day per year as a social day and involves all employees at the respective location in this initiative.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Contractual partners in the supply chain and their employees**\n\n**MATERIAL TOPICS IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nContractual partner fair pay\n\nG7 Fair competition\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nWithin the scope of its project development, the Instone Group works in partnership with its contractors. Among other things, the Instone Group awards the implementation of its construction projects to contractual partners, who take over the various construction activities under the coordination of Instone Group project management. As a result, our contractual partners' employees play a key role in that they complete the projects of the Instone Group successfully and to a high level of quality. This means that these employees, some or all of whom are working at the construction site, are exposed to different risks than employees working in offices.\n\nThe Instone Group endeavours to establish lasting and dependable partnerships with its contractual partners. Once an order is initiated, sustainability topics are discussed with the contractual partners and the results documented in the minutes of the meeting in order to increase transparency and ensure these topics are included in the collaboration. This also allows us to comply with the various regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Purchasing Department is primarily responsible for the management of material topics under \"Contractual partners in the supply chain and their employees\". The current (regulatory) requirements for sustainable cooperation, especially in construction, are addressed in regular exchanges with the Sustainability department and translated into concrete (communication) measures. Given that legal requirements are continually changing, it is important to include contractual partners in this process and notify them of any changes at an early stage. This is especially true with the current drafts of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which is expected to become relevant to the Instone Group from 2025 once it is finalised. We have already conducted a preliminary review of the potential implications and requirements for the Instone Group. The Instone Group will continue to monitor these developments and take appropriate measures as soon as the final version with binding requirements is passed.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Contractual partner fair pay (S10) | Fair competition (G7)**\n\nThe Instone Group awards single or (partial) general contracts for construction services. In cooperation with the Project Service and Project Management departments, bills of quantities are created based on planning documents, building specifications, expert reports and other documents, and invitations to tender are then sent by Purchasing on a trade-specific basis to a predefined group of tenderers.\n\nThe tenders submitted are compared in a price table. Depending on the requirement, the tenders are negotiated with the potential contractual partners in a process that is transparent within the Company; this process is recorded and any changes, for example to the scope of work, are recorded in the contract. Every decision to award a contract is made following a standardised multiple-control verification process. This open and transparent process is a key component of any lasting, trusting cooperation and ensures fair competition.

The quarterly monitoring of the topics is conducted in the risk report.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee performs a quarterly review of the progress made towards achieving the set sustainability targets. Suggestions for new targets and/or changes to existing targets are discussed and the effectiveness and feasibility of measures as well as their implementation are examined.\n\nThe results of the review, the list of intended measures as well as associated and qualified impacts, risks and opportunities are submitted to the Management Board for final review at the end of the due diligence process and once every step of the materiality analysis is complete. If a change is made, it is documented accordingly and the final list of approved material topics, including estimates of impact, risks and opportunities as well as action plans, is approved. Progress on the measures is documented in the annual report.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Sustainable corporate governance**\n\n- **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nA description of the key principles of corporate governance and culture and associated policies is provided in the general section on governance processes in the management report o[n page 182 et seqq.](#page-181-0) \n\nIn terms of the integration of sustainability aspects into corporate governance, the focus this past year was primarily on increasing the standardisation of electronic data collection and processing for key sustainability figures. Further formalising data collection and integrating it into the existing process landscape is an important goal, especially with regard to CSRD/ESRS requirements. The integration of the key sustainability figures into investment decisions and sales approvals demonstrates how relevant they are. The new processes enable (project) decisions to be made based on data whilst also ensuring that business practices are aligned with sustainable targets. Responsibilities and approval and control processes (ICS) have been defined as part of the expansion of the structured recording of relevant key sustainability figures, especially at project level. The Sustainability department is responsible for initiating/monitoring the overall process.\n\nThe Instone Group regularly audits compliance with contractual partner requirements, required proof of good standing and compliance with minimum wage laws, as well as the daily site diaries. Compliance with Instone Group policies and regulations, which include compliance with ESG criteria in addition to technical, professional and legal requirements, play an increasingly central role (Business ethics, G2).\n\nThe Management Board has laid down the fundamental values of lawful, ethical conduct in a Group-wide Code of Conduct for employees and contractual partners. This specifies the Instone Group's understanding of business ethics as well as applicable duties and responsibilities and establishes standards of conduct. It provides employees and contractual partners with guidance in their daily work and contains binding requirements for their conduct.\n\nCompliance with the Code of Conduct and other provisions aims to protect the Instone Group from losses resulting, for example, from corruption, money laundering, unfair competition, abuse of power, violations of employee rights (including by contractual partners), greenwashing, or violations of other laws and regulations.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\nSustainable corporate governance is ensured by the governance processes (se[e page 182 et seqq. of](#page-181-0) the management report). This means no further measures are required for compliance. The implementation of the material topics is described further and specified below.\n\n#### **Economic development of the company (G1 )**\n\nThe \"Economic development of the company\" was identified in the materiality analysis as a topic with double materiality. The economic report o[n page 129 et seqq. c](#page-128-0)ontains detailed information on this subject. The key points of the strategy and the future prospects of the Company are described here. The resulting risks and opportunities can also be found in the risk and opportunities report on [page 156 et seqq..](#page-155-0) \n\n#### **Payment behaviour (towards contractors) (G8 )**\n\nIn addition to transparent communication, compliance with agreed payment terms is crucial to establishing trust. As a reliable partner, the Instone Group normally makes a contractual commitment to make payment within 14 to 30 days of invoice receipt, depending on the agreement. The Instone Group generally meets the agreed payment deadlines. This is an important basis for trusting cooperation between the Instone Group, as customer, and its contractual partners.\n\nRisks relating to contractual partners resulting from the current situation are addressed in the risk and opportunity management section of the management repor[t. page 168](#page-167-0)\n\n#### **Respect for human rights (S11) | Business ethics – compliance with social and ethical criteria (G2)**\n\nRespect for human rights is a vital part of the Instone Group's responsible corporate governance. In its declaration on human rights, diversity and freedom of association released in the past financial year, the Instone Group expressly committed itself to respecting human rights. The Company believes that all humans are endowed with equal and inalienable rights from birth. Every person deserves respect, dignity and the chance to live free of discrimination. The Instone Group condemns all forms of injustice, oppression and violence against fellow human beings.\n\nThe Instone Group expects and requires complete and total respect for human rights along the entire value chain, internally and externally, at all times. The fundamental values of lawful and ethical conduct are defined in the Instone Group's Code of Conduct for contractual partners and employees and are derived from the duties and responsibilities prescribed by law or official regulations and the Instone Group's understanding of the matter. These are used to establish standards of conduct. All employees/contractual partners receive the Code of Conduct as an annex to their contract form (G2). It provides employees, service providers and contractual partners with guidance in their dayto-day work and conduct. If the Instone Group becomes aware of any non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, a review will be initiated and appropriate action considered. For contractual partners, the Legal, HR and Purchasing departments are responsible for reviewing these matters and deciding what action to take. Information on the number of incidents/complaints is shown i[n table 004.](#page-66-0)\n\n#### **Compliance/anti-corruption measures (G4)**\n\nAt the Instone Group, compliance is an integral part (impact dimension) of responsible corporate governance. The central compliance organisation sees itself as a key contributor to an integrity-led corporate governance and culture.\n\nManagement of the material topics in this action area is primarily the responsibility of the Legal Department, which undertakes the planning and implementation of measures for material topics in the areas of compliance, anti-corruption and the prevention of money-laundering as part of a due diligence process and coordinates with the Sustainability Department and committee on relevant topics in accordance with the governance concept.\n\nThe goal of the Group-wide compliance management system is to prevent violations of applicable laws and internal policies, and to protect the Instone Group and its employees from inappropriate and unlawful conduct. The key pillars of the compliance management system include the welldeveloped compliance culture, in particular the whistleblower system, and the compliance programme, which includes measures that are used to avoid and mitigate compliance risks.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe whistleblower system offers employees and third parties the opportunity to report potential violations of rules or laws by employees to the Instone Group. Each report is examined and followed up systematically in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- The process is fair,\n- The whistleblower's anonymity is protected,\n- Investigations are confidential and\n- Processes are efficient and protected.\n\nA digital whistleblower system and direct contact with the Compliance Officer are options available to those looking to report misconduct.\n\nLikewise, under no circumstances is corruption tolerated by the Instone Group, neither on the part of business partners or third parties nor on the part of the Company's own employees. Corruption cases are consistently investigated without exception in order to protect employees and the Compan[y. GRI 205-3](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Instone Group also does not allow transactions with the Company to be misused for the purposes of money laundering or the financing of terrorism. The Company rejects any transaction in which a third party benefits from a criminal act. The Instone Group has therefore put in place special preventive measures as part of its compliance programme, to be taken on a routine basis or as the need arises, to detect and combat such suspicions. These measures include:\n\n- Due diligence of business partners for compliance risks,\n- Due diligence around suspected money laundering,\n- Checking of potential business partners against sanctions lists and\n- Verification of banking information in payment transactions with business partners and clients.\n\nThe Instone Group is involved in various initiatives, associations and organisations. In some cases, the Company's employees perform representative duties. The principles of responsible corporate governance are also ensured in this regard: No financial resources beyond normal membership fees are provided[.

According to the Federal Statistical Office, priceadjusted gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 0.3% in 2023. As a result, development in Germany fell short of development in the other major economies in the EU, the USA or China.\n\nThe main factors were the long-term weak order books, which is likely to have had an increasing impact on industrial production. In addition, increased financing costs and the expiry of the environmental bonus dampened investments. The increase in interest rates and the poor weather with high rainfall also weighed on construction production and investment.\n\nFor 2024, the Deutsche Bundesbank expects a moderate recovery of the German economy and moderate GDP growth of 0.4%. The Bundesbank assumes that expanding international markets will have a positive impact on export demand and that falling inflation combined with significant wage increases should have positive effects on private consumer demand. The Bundesbank expects German GDP growth to accelerate slightly to +1.2% in 2025.\n\n#### **The labour market remains stable**\n\nThe labour market remained robust despite the difficult economic environment.\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office, the average number of people in employment in Germany continued to rise by an average of 333,000 people (+0.7%) despite the decline in economic output, reaching a new record level with an average of 45.9 million employees. The reasons for this increase included the immigration of foreign workers and the increase in the employment of the domestic population. According to the Federal Employment Agency, the unemployment rate in Germany rose slightly year-on-year to 5.7% in December 2023 (previous year: 5.3%). This increase was particularly due to Ukrainian refugee migration. The Federal Agency assumes that this effect accounts for 0.4 percentage points.\n\nThe Bundesbank assumes that this high level of employment can be maintained in 2024. However, due to the increased level of refugees, this can lead to an average annual increase in registered unemployed.\n\n#### **Inflation remains high but declining**\n\nThe development of inflation was also one of the most important economic parameters in 2023. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the average increase in consumer prices in Germany in 2023 was 5.9% (previous year: 6.9%). The inflation rate therefore remained at a consistently high level. The impact of geopolitical crises remains noticeable in this respect. Following the sharp rise in energy costs in the previous year, food prices were a major cost driver in 2023 and underwent increases of an average of 12.4% year-on-year. However, the rate of inflation showed a marked downward trend over the course of the year. Even though the inflation rate rose again in December compared to the previous month, at 3.7% by the end of the year it was already well below the average level for the year as a whole.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nTo contain inflation, international central banks relied on the continuation of restrictive monetary policy with further interest rate increases.\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank expects inflation to fall further to 2.7% for the 2024 average for the year. As labour costs continue to rise, a reduction in the price pressure on food and energy raw materials should contribute to this.\n\n### **A further rise in interest rates on housing loans has a significant negative impact on credit demand**\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has continued to raise interest rates significantly from 2.5% at the end of 2022 to 4.5% by September 2023 in several interest rate steps. This coincided with an increase in long-term interest rates. According to the Deutsche Bundesbank, the average effective interest rate for housing loans granted to private households rose from 3.6% in December 2022 to 4.12% in December 2023. At the end of 2021, the comparable interest rate was 1.34%.\n\nThe further increase in financing costs had an increasingly negative impact on the affordability of real estate and therefore on demand for real estate loans in the course of 2023. According to the Deutsche Bundesbank the volume of newly issued real estate loans from German banks to private households fell to around €161 billion in 2023 – a significant decrease compared to around €257 billion in the same period of the previous year (37.4%).\n\n### **Population in Germany increased again**\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office, 84.6 million people lived in Germany as of 30 September 2023. This corresponds to a population increase of 336,000 people (+0.4%) year-on-year. The population of Germany has therefore reached a new peak. However, the rate of increase has weakened compared to 2022. Due to the refugee migration following the war in Ukraine, the increase in the population in 2022 amounted to around 1.1 million people. This positive development is driven exclusively by net immigration, whereas the surplus of deaths compared to births had a negative impact on population development. Since the early 1970s, deaths in Germany have exceeded births.\n\nThe development of the number of households is the most important demand determinant for demand for housing. Several social developments have ensured that this figure has increased disproportionately compared to population development in recent years. According to the Federal Statistical Office, while the population grew by only 2.5% between 2000 and 2022, the number of households increased by 8.5% over the same period. This is largely driven by the increase in the share of single-person households, which rose from 35.8% to 40.8% during this period. One reason for this is, for example, the increasing number of people living alone (singularisation) due, among other things, to increasing life expectancy. The Federal Statistical Office expects a further increase in the share of single-person households by 2040.\n\nAs a result of these factors, there will also be an increase in demand for housing in German cities with good infrastructure in the coming years.\n\n#### **Building permits and completions are declining**\n\nFrom January to November 2023, the number of building permits in Germany fell by 25.9% compared to the previous year to a total of 238,500 homes. This includes both new builds and new homes in existing buildings. In the new construction sector, permits for single and two-family homes in particular fell drastically by 38.6% and 49.2%, respectively, while in the case of multi-family homes there was a drop of 23.8%.\n\nThis development also indicates a significant decline in construction work. While in 2022 some 295,000 apartments were completed in Germany, the ifo Institute only expects 245,000 homes to be completed in 2023 and 2025 out of 200,000. This is a clear failure to meet the federal government's target of 400,000 new homes per year.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Crisis exacerbates housing shortage**\n\nThe rising demand for housing as a result of the positive development of households and the population as well as the continuing decline in the supply of new housing is exacerbating the housing shortage in Germany. A study by the Pestel Institute found that more than 700,000 additional homes were required in Germany in 2023. This is the biggest housing deficit in more than 20 years. The shortage is increasing all the time, particularly where affordable housing is concerned.\n\nThe continued reduction in vacant housing also reflects the scarcity in the housing market. This is shown in the data from the current CBRE empirica vacancy index. At the end of 2022, the market-active vacancy rate, in other words apartment blocks that can be rented directly or capitalised in the medium-term, was 2.5% (previous year: 2.8%). As a result, the absolute vacancy rate fell significantly year-on-year by around 53,000 to around 554,000 homes (previous year: 607,000 homes). For the first time in 22 years, there has been no increase in one of the 400 areas analysed. The lowest rate remained unchanged in Munich with 0.1%, followed by Frankfurt am Main, Münster and Freiburg at 0.2% each.\n\n### **Comparatively moderate declines in new housing prices in 2023**\n\nPrices for newly built residential units in Germany in the top 7 cities fell moderately in 2023. According to data from the consultancy company bulwiengesa, the average price development in the individual cities was around 4%. According to bulwiengesa, the cities of Stuttgart and Munich have the most stable development in this respect, while the price declines in Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main have been somewhat stronger.\n\nFor 2024, we expect prices for new build properties to stabilise in Germany's most attractive metropolitan regions as supply is still very low in these regions and this will be offset by a substantial and growing demand surplus. This is also reflected in the sustainable positive development of rents. The high energy efficiency of new buildings is another factor stabilising the prices of our products. Non-renovated old buildings have lost more value.\n\nThere continues to be a clear upward trend in rents. The continuing high demand for rental homes is due to a lack of affordable supply. Net immigration and declining new construction activity are exacerbating the shortage. In addition to cold rents, ancillary costs have also increased enormously as a result of the energy crisis, which has led to a significant cost burden for tenants. This has triggered additional demand pressure from tenants for energy-efficient apartments and thus new buildings.\n\nAccording to bulwiengesa, first-time rents for new buildings in Germany increased by an average of 4.3% in the top 7 cities in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Overall statement on the financial year**\n\n**2023 financial year: Instone Group achieves annual** \n\nDespite a crisis in the housing development sector in 2023, the Instone Real Estate Group SE was able to hold its own in a difficult overall economic environment and achieve all its financial targets for the 2023\n\nThe sharp rise in interest rates led to a significant decline in private and institutional demand and to a deterioration in financing conditions in the sector. The further increase in construction costs – even if this weakened over the course of the year – also had a negative impact on project margins. In this environment, the Instone Group benefited from a high number of projects already sold. The continuing high gross margin is also strongly attributable to its own expertise in construction management and the associated stringent cost discipline, which is a distinguishing feature of\n\n**targets in a difficult industry environment**\n\nthe company compared to many of its competitors.\n\nThe decrease in its project portfolio by 31 December 2023 to €6,972.0 million (previous year: €7,668.8 million) was the result of disposals due to completion in the amount of €493.2 million and revaluations and the effects of the deconsolidation of a project in the amount of €203.6 million. Adjusted group sales fell by around 1% to €616.0 million as a result of the interest rate-induced decline in demand (previous year: €621.0 million). Adjusted earnings after tax (EAT) were down slightly on the previous year at €48.2 million (previous year: €50.0 million). The improved result of equity investments was almost completely compensated by the increase in platform costs.

Despite continuing construction activity, the significantly reduced purchases of land plots resulted in a reduction in the cost of materials to €-544.5 million (previous year: €-551.2 million). The increase in inventories to €167.6 million (previous year: €123.5 million) reflects the increasing progress of construction in projects that are not sold or that are sold in the form of a share deal.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, one-off expenses relating to the valuation of inventories in the amount of €-17.7 million were recorded in project costs. These expenses result from the rescheduling of projects due to the continuing difficult conditions in the industry and general economic environment in Germany and the need to replan individual projects. These expenses are unusual in their amount and cannot be regarded as recurring on a regular basis. For this reason, these are adjusted as non-recurring effects.\n\nIndirect sales expenses in the amount of €-2.5 million (previous year: €-2.8 million) and material cost-related other operating income of €15.1 million (previous year: €10.2 million), of which €13.4 million from grants, were allocated to adjusted project costs as of 31 December 2023. The adjustment of the capitalised interest in the changes in inventories of €-12.2 million (previous year: €-3.2 million) were was added to the adjusted project costs. Effects from the amortisation of purchase price allocations reduced adjusted project costs by €3.0 million (previous year: €10.3 million). Due to the separate valuation of share deals, adjusted project costs again increased by €-88.0 million (previous year: €-50.6 million).\n\n| Project costs                             |        |        | TABLE 024      |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |        |        |                |\n|                                           | 2023   | 2022   | Change<br>in % |\n| Project costs                             | -394.6 | -427.6 | -7.7           |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations | 3.0    | 10.3   | -70.9          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          | 0.5    | 4.1    | -87.8          |\n| + non recurring effects                   | 17.7   | 0.0    | 0.0            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      | -88.0  | -50.6  | 73.9           |\n| Project costs adjusted                    | -461.5 | -463.8 | -0.5           |\n\n#### Gross profit\n\nAdjusted gross profit declined to €154.5 million as a result of the heavier fall in revenue compared to project costs during the financial year and due to the lower project gross profit margin (previous year: €157.2 million) compared with the previous year.\n\n| Gross profit                              |       |       | TABLE 025      |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |       |       |                |\n|                                           | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| Gross profit                              | 119.6 | 139.9 | -14.5          |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations | 5.6   | 14.3  | -60.8          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          | 0.5   | 4.1   | -87.8          |\n| + non recurring effects                   | 17.7  | 0.0   | 0.0            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      | 11.1  | -1.1  | n/a            |\n| Gross profit adjusted                     | 154.5 | 157.2 | -1.7           |\n\nThe adjusted gross profit margin – calculated from the adjusted gross profit relating to the adjusted revenue – amounted to 25.1% (previous year: 25.3%).

In terms of costs, the measures introduced to increase efficiency will contribute to a noticeable reduction in platform costs. This enabled us to achieve the goal of reducing the ongoing annualised platform costs to around €70 million by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. In the financial year, indirect sales costs of €2.4 million and material cost-related other operating income in the amount of €15.1 million were reclassified as project costs and other non-recurring effects were adjusted in the amount of €3.8 million.

GRI 2-7, 2-8](#page-286-0) \n\nThe reported other operating income, at €25.6 million (previous year: €17.9 million) was higher than last year. This included material cost related other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials of €15.1 million (previous year: €10.2 million), which were reclassified as project costs. Included in this are especially income from the realisation of grants of €13.4 million (previous year: €7.3 million). Income from the reversal of provisions for and liabilities relating to employees during the reporting period was below the previous year's level at €3.3 million (previous year: €3.8 million). In addition, income was realised from the reversal of provisions and project-related liabilities released in the amount of €3.5 million (previous year: €5.8 million). In addition, income of €2.8 million was reported from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.\n\nThe reported other operating expenses increased to €-36.5 million in the reporting period (previous year: €-31.6 million), mainly due to increased expenses for warranty claims for old projects (€-5.0 million) and increased expenses relating to structural reorganisation of €-2.1 million. This is offset by consulting expenses of €2.6 million and sales costs of €1.5 million. Other operating expenses mainly include costs for warranties, consulting expenses, sales costs, IT costs and court costs, solicitors' and notaries' fees.\n\nThe reported depreciation and amortisation was €-5.0 million (previous year: €-4.8 million), a slight increase compared with the previous year.\n\n#### Share of results of joint ventures\n\nThe adjusted shares of results of joint ventures of €8.1 million (previous year: €3.9 million) during the financial year was attributable almost completely to construction activities and the sale of the Berlin joint venture Friedenauer Höhe, and reflects the expected development of this project.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)\n\nIn 2023, adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell slightly compared to the previous year to €86.1 million despite the increased earnings from share of results of joint ventures compared to the previous year, essentially due to the increased platform costs and the reduced gross profit compared to the previous year (previous year: €88.6 million).\n\n| EBIT                                      |      |       |      | TABLE 027      |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|-------|------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |      |       |      |                |\n|                                           |      | 2023  | 2022 | Change<br>in % |\n| EBIT                                      |      | 60.1  | 76.6 | -21.5          |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations |      | 5.6   | 14.3 | -60.8          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          |      | -12.2 | -3.2 | >100.0         |\n| + non recurring effects                   |      | 21.5  | 2.1  | n/a            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      |      | 11.1  | -1.1 | n/a            |\n| EBIT adjusted                             |      | 86.1  | 88.6 | -2.8           |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                      | In % | 14.0  | 14.3 |                |\n\n#### Investment and financial result\n\nAs in the previous year, there was no materially adjusted income from investments in the reporting period.\n\nThe reported financial result deteriorated in the financial year to €-27.1 million (previous year: €-19.1 million).

Current right of use assets in the amount of €3.0 million (previous year: €3.0 million) covers a leasehold plot intended for project development.\n\nOther current receivables and other assets decreased from €133.9 million to €74.6 million in 2023. A considerable share of these items consists largely of approved public grants of €51.6 million (previous year: €86.7 million) for the construction of buildings, including subsidy of the KfW efficiency programme. The majority of this change as at the reporting date is due to approved grants being reported in a different period for the purposes of accounting that is expected to occur between the start of sales and the start of construction. In addition, conversions of projects due to these changes were corrected according to the corresponding receivables. In addition, the decrease in the success-based income is also due to pledged public grants already being accepted. Prepayments on land for which the transfer of benefits and encumbrances takes place after the balance sheet date decreased to €14.1 million in the financial year due to a lack of new investment (previous year: €42.4 million[\\). GRI 201-4](#page-286-0)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and term deposits of €383.6 million (previous year: €255.6 million) increased mainly due to the continuous inflow of funds from ongoing project developments.

During the same period, current financial liabilities fell to €136.1 million (previous year: €228.6 million). The total decline in financial liabilities is due to a reduced net borrowing of financial loans in the reporting period.\n\nLeasing liabilities in the amount of €14.7 million (previous year: €10.9 million) have increased mainly due to the initial accounting of a leasehold plot intended for project development as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe increase in other non-current liabilities to €37.8 million (previous year: €0.0 million) was completely related to interest and repayment subsidy in connection with subsidised loans.\n\nTrade payables fell during the financial year to €142.2 million (previous year: €150.5 million) and mainly included the services provided by contractors. The fall corresponds to the decrease in output in the financial year and is also related to the reporting date.\n\nThe increase in other non-current liabilities to €431.9 million (previous year: €393.6 million) resulted mainly from advance payments received for the \"Westville\" project in the amount of €383.5 million (previous year: €302.5 million). The fall in liabilities from government grants in the amount of €32.4 million (previous year: €79.8 million) corresponds to the decrease in other current receivables and assets related to public funding.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDeferred tax provisions as at 31 December 2023 amounted to €44.1 million (previous year: €50.3 million).

As of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents totalling €423.3 million (previous year: €458.6 million) were available from project financing (excluding the subsided loan for the \"Westville\" project) and in the amount of €335.0 million (previous year: €348.0 million) from corporate finance. These corporate finance agreements contain financial ratios that are described in the \"Other disclosures\" section of the notes to the consolidated financial statement[s page 241.](#page-240-0)\n\nIn the balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, the liabilities from corporate finance amounted to €176,8 million (previous year: €179.7 million) and liabilities from project-related financing (including the subsidised loan for the \"Westville\" project) ) to €355.8 million (previous year: €341.0 million). Recognised total liabilities from financing operations thus fell to €532.6 million on the reporting date (previous year: €520.6 million). The current project financing included in this is composed of option agreements for extension.\n\nThe individual project financing of the Instone Group was negotiated with various financial institutions and is subject to different conditions. In general, the loans are subject to variable interest rates. Different amounts and frequencies have been agreed for the use of funds from loans with fixed interest or fixed term. The average interest margins for 2023 were at the same level as the previous year. As a result of the project financing, which is mainly subject to variable interest rates, the interest rate increases of the European Central Bank led to higher interest rates and, as a result, to higher interest expenses. The mostly variable interest rates are between 1.24% and 3.00% (previous year: between 1.24% and 3.00%) on EURIBOR and under fixed-interest contracts at a fixed interest rate between 1.15% and 6.51% (previous year: between 1.95% and 4.50%).\n\nShort-term funds needed for project-related payments can be obtained by means of overdraft facilities agreed with individual banks. To compensate for interest payments, all payments already received which the buyers of our properties pay into separately managed collective accounts for the purchase price payment are credited to these current account facilities. If necessary, these overdrafts can be converted into fixed-interest or fixedterm loans.\n\nThe maturities of the non-discounted repayment amounts are as follows:\n\n### **Financial liabilities TABLE 035**\n\nIn millions of euros\n\n#### **Corporate finance (promissory notes)**\n\n|                        | Due in | Credit<br>amount |\n|------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Term < 1 year          | 2024   | 5.0              |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years | 2025   | 100.0            |\n| Term > 2 and < 3 years | 2026   | 20.0             |\n| Term > 3 years         | 2027   | 50.0             |\n|                        |        | 175.0            |\n\n| Corporate finance (syndicated loans) |        |             | Utilisation |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023  |\n| Term < 1 year                        | 2024   | 118.3       | 0.0         |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years               | 2025   | 41.7        | 0.0         |\n|                                      |        | 160.0       | 0.0         |\n\n| Project financing      |        |             | Utilisation |\n|------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n|                        | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023  |\n| Term < 1 year          | 2024   | 133.1       | 129.0       |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years | 2025   | 232.7       | 92.2        |\n| Term > 2 and < 3 years | 2026   | 0.0         | 0.0         |\n| Term > 3 years         | 2027   | 57.6        | 57.6        |\n|                        |        | 423.3       | 278.8       |\n\n| Project financing<br>(promotional loans for customers) |        |             | Utilisation1 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|--------------|\n|                                                        | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023   |\n| Term > 3 years                                         | >2026  | 199.0       | 115.9        |\n|                                                        |        | 199.0       | 115.9        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> This includes interest and repayment subsidy of €37.8 million that is recognised under other non-current liabilities.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n|                               | Condensed statement of cash flows                           |       |       | TABLE 036      |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n|                               | In millions of euros                                        |       |       |                |\n| Our company                   |                                                             | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| To our shareholders           | Cash flow from operations                                   | 107.7 | 70.2  | 53.4           |\n| Combined<br>management report | Cash flow from investing activities                         | 11.5  | 9.4   | 22.3           |\n|                               | Free cash flow                                              | 119.2 | 79.6  | 49.7           |\n|                               | Cash flow from financing activities                         | 9.8   | 45.0  | -78.2          |\n| Foundations of the Group      | Cash change in cash and cash equivalents                    | 129.0 | 124.6 | 3.5            |\n| Sustainability report         | Cash and cash equivalents at the<br>beginning of the period | 255.6 | 131.0 | 95.6           |\n| ► Economic report             | Other changes in cash and cash<br>equivalents               | -1.0  | 0.0   | n/c            |\n|                               | Cash and cash equivalents<br>at the end of the period       | 383.6 | 255.6 | 50.1           |\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\nRisk and\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nCash flow from operations in the Instone Group in the amount of €107.7 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: €70.2 million) was mainly positively influenced by the increased cash flows from customer payments for ongoing projects as well as by cash flows from handovers of projects with final payment. There was a reduction of liabilities to contractors for ongoing projects with simultaneous purchase price payments and land acquisition taxes for land totalling €10.4 million (previous year: €117.0 million). In addition, income tax payments amounting to €44.3 million were made in the reporting period (previous year: €4.5 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group was able to achieve a positive overall cash flow from operations and thus strengthen its position in terms of cash and cash equivalents. The operating cash flow, adjusted for payments for land, in the period under review was distinctly positive at €118.1 million (previous year: €187.2 million). This underpins the long-term positive liquidity returns of the Instone Group from the ongoing housing project developments despite the continuing difficult industry environment.\n\n| Cash flow from operations                            |       |       | TABLE 037      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                                 |       |       |                |\n|                                                      | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                      | 91.1  | 93.4  | -2.5           |\n| Other non-cash items                                 | -9.5  | -20.2 | -53.1          |\n| Taxes paid                                           | -44.3 | -4.5  | n/c            |\n| Change in net working capital1                       | 70.4  | 1.6   | n/c            |\n| Cash flow from operations                            | 107.7 | 70.2  | -53.4          |\n| Payments for land                                    | 10.4  | 117.0 | -91.1          |\n| Cash flow from operations<br>without new investments | 118.1 | 187.2 | -36.9          |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Net working capital is made up of inventories, contract assets and trade receivables, other receivables less contract liabilities and trade payables and other liabilities.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation of non-current assets of €5.0 million (previous year: €4.8 million), expenses from deferred tax of €5.9 million (previous year: € 2.2 million), the results from the revaluation of investments valued at equity by €8.1 million (previous year: €3.9 million), expenses for interest of €27.1 million (previous year: (€19.1 million), the decrease in provisions by €6.0 million (previous year: decrease by €4.6 million), one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories in the amount of €17.7 million (previous year: €0.0 million) as well as expenses for income taxes amounting to €20.0 million (previous year: €15.4 million) in the 2023 financial year did not affect cash.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to €11.5 million in the financial year (previous year: €9.4 million).

The combination of the high level of interest rates, the more restrictive procurement of real estate financing (compared to the period before 2022) and the loss of purchasing power resulting from the significant increase in consumer prices from 2021 to 2023 continue to unsettle private buyers and is reduce the number of potential buyers in the year under review.\n\nInstitutional investors also exhibited considerable purchasing restraint due to interest rates and the tougher macro environment.\n\nThe forecast published by the Management Board on 16 March 2023 for the volume of sales contracts in the 2023 financial year of more than €150 million was achieved with a sales volume of €211.4 million for 370 units and exceeded original expectations by 40%. This represents a decrease of around €81 million compared to the sales volume of €292.1 million (530 sales units) achieved in 2022. It should be noted that the direct and indirect economic effects of the war in Ukraine at the beginning of 2022 only had a significant effect on the sales agreements towards the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIn a long-term comparison, the sales speed of our unit sales projects for 2023 as a whole is below average. In the last quarter of the 2023 financial year, there was a moderate recovery. This is also due to the \"Urban.Isle Campus\" sub-projects in Hamburg that have been launched in sales and to a sub-project of the \"Neckar.Au-Viertel\" in Rottenburg. In addition, a large part of the sales success is reflected in projects tailored to investment sales. The shortfall in the fixed interest rate of 4% for ten and 15-year construction loans had the first positive effects on the number of sales contracts at the end of 2023. With a sales offering of 325 units in unit sales at the beginning of the year and an increase in supply of 419 units, 166 units with a revenue volume of €82.0 million were sold in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe majority of the sales volume in the reporting period was attributable to our institutional projects amounting to €129.4 million and 204 sales units. Adjusted for the sales volume resulting from supplementary items to purchase agreements concluded prior to the reporting period (around €50 million), the sales performance of institutional investors and in individual sales, however, is at a comparable level in the year under review.\n\nThe realised volume of sales contracts of around 78% as at 31 December 2023 was mainly focused on the most important metropolitan regions of Germany. Around 22% is attributable to other attractive, medium-sized cities.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n### **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and\n\n#### [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nImage /page/146/Figure/17 description: This image is a pie chart titled \"Marketing in 12M 2023 by region\".

Given the current supply base, we are at a lower level than at the end of 2022 (325 units and €221 million).\n\nFor example, the Instone Group has driven product modification through higher sustainability classes, increased eligibility and smaller housing typologies to achieve broader performance and attract investment sales. As a result, four sub-projects with a total of 419 sales units were launched on the market in the year under review and led to an increase in the sales offer of the individual sales objects. As of 31 December 2023, 333 of the new units that had been launched for sale were already under construction. Construction of the 86 others is planned to start in 2024.\n\n# ←\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\nThe sales made in the reporting period in the individual sales division led to a reduction in the sales offering. A total of 166 units were successfully sold in the 2023 financial year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Instone Group's project portfolio comprised 45 projects with a current expected volume of sales contracts of €6,972.0 million. It was therefore down on 31 December 2022 (€7,668.8 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group continued to pursue the strategic approach of extremely selective investment activity, which was deliberately chosen in 2022. For example, no new investment approvals were granted in the reporting period and therefore no new property purchase agreements were concluded. We also expect attractive acquisition opportunities for projects of competitors with weaker financial resources in the changed interest rate and financing environment. The exploitation of these opportunities is expected to lead to significant investment activity on our part in the near to medium-term.\n\nThe main factors in the portfolio decline are the completions (€-493 million) and the portfolio's revenue reductions (€-204 million).\n\nFor example, a total of six projects were completed in the reporting period and taken out of the project portfolio review with the successful handover of all sub-projects (see the section \"Adjusted sales revenues[\" page 151\\).](#page-150-0)\n\nIn terms of revenue changes, the removal of the \"Am Sonnenberg, Wiesbaden\" project due to the change in the continuation of the project in the at-equity company as of the second quarter of 2023 played a significant role in the reduction. Further revenue reductions in various projects were mainly offset by revenue increases in other projects within the scope of further planning specification and changes in the sales concepts, as well as sales price increases through supplementary items to the purchase contract.\n\nWe have already realised adjusted revenues of €2,022.5 million from the current project portfolio, of which €788.2 millionhas already been handed over.\n\nImage /page/147/Figure/16 description: This image shows the development of the project portfolio on December 31, 2023.

As of 31 December 2023, the Management Board expects construction prices to move sideways, due to the current high cost level and the decreasing dynamics in construction production. An additional positive effect results from the adjustment of one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories (see also Results of operations, net assets and financial position chapter, Project costs section). This is reflected in the project valuations at the end of 2023 and leads to an improvement in the forecast gross project profit margin on the project portfolio to around 24.6%, without taking into account the \"Westville\" project in Frankfurt am Main.1\n\nImage /page/148/Figure/17 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"Project portfolio by region\".

The total value of the project portfolio is €7.0 billion.\n\n**FIGURE 020**\n\n<sup>2</sup> 0.7% of the project portfolio has already been transferred. These projects are included in \"pre-construction\".\n\n<sup>3</sup> 8.0% of the project portfolio are in the status of land acquisition. These projects are included in \"pre-sale\".\n\nGiven our project portfolio's continued growth in recent years, the conscious decision to take a selective approach to starting sales in the current macroeconomic environment and the on-going completion of sold projects, most of our current projects are in the \"pre-sale\" development stage.\n\nThe total revenue volume of the completed and handed over projects for the 2023 financial year amounts to €493 million. This is offset by an expected total revenue volume of €201 million from the sub-projects which construction began on in 2023. Since the total portfolio value decreased during the course of the 2023 financial year, all of the categories listed in figure 020 are at a comparable, relative level to the previous year (31 December 2022: 41.3% \"under construction\", 2.2% in \"pre-construction\" and 56.4% in \"pre-sale\").\n\nIn addition, the preceding diagram shows that, as at 31 December 2023 we had already sold approximately 39% of the anticipated overall revenue volume of the project portfolio. In terms of the anticipated revenue volume from \"under construction\" and \"pre-construction\" projects, approximately 88% of projects had been sold as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition to the 45 projects, the Instone Group's project portfolio will be supplemented by four further projects that will be realised in joint ventures. Overall, a total volume of sales of around €1.3 billion (Instone Group share approx. €630 million) and the development of approximately 2,100 residential units was expected for these projects consolidated using the equity method.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**Adjusted revenue**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDespite the persistently difficult macroeconomic conditions, adjusted sales at €616.0 million were achieved in the 2023 financial year at the previous year's level (previous year's figure: €621.0 million).

In the 2023 financial year, other operating expenses mainly included expenses for organisational consulting and services amounting to €-5.5 million (previous year: €-6.9 million), other taxes expenses of €-1.7 million (previous year: €-1.3 million), expenses in connection with severance payments in the amount of €-1.4 million (previous year: €-0.2 million), expenses for IT services in the amount of €-1.2 million (previous year:€-0.3 million) and expenses for insurance premiums of €-0.8 million (previous year: €-1.0 million).\n\nThe changes in the financial result to €56.6 million (previous year: €63,7 million) were essentially made up as follows:\n\n- → Income from profit and loss transfer agreements amounted to €51.6 million (previous year: €71.1 million). The significant decline is due, on the one hand, to the lower margins compared to the previous year for the residential development projects handed over to customers after completion and, on the other hand, to one-off expenses recorded for the first time in the year under review relating to the valuation of inventories in the amount of €17.7 million (previous year: €0.0 million) owned by Instone Real Estate Development GmbH.\n- → Income from loans amounted to €15.3 million (previous year: €9.2 million).\n- → Income from interest on investments amounted to €4.5 million (previous year: €0.3 million)\n- → Expenses from the acceptance of losses amounted to €-3.1 million (previous year: €-5.8 million).\n- → Interest and similar expenses were at a similar level to the previous year at €-12.0 million (previous year: €-11.0 million).\n\nTaxes on income and earnings amounted to €-17.7 million (previous year: €-16.9 million).\n\nIn the period under review, there was a total net profit of €22.8 million (previous year: €34.3 million).

On the assets side, this is mainly due to the reduction of loans to and receivables from affiliated companies and, on the liabilities side, mainly result from the reduction in liabilities to affiliated companies.\n\nNon-current assets mainly included the investment book values of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, Essen amounting to €222.1 million (previous year: €181.8 million). The increase compared to the previous year is mainly due to the lateral merger of Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH, Leipzig with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, Essen.\n\nLoans, receivables, other assets and deferred income amounting to €210.9 million (previous year: €307.0 million) include loans to affiliated companies amounting to €119.4 million (previous year: €200.4million) and ongoing receivables from affiliated companies based on profit and loss transfer agreements.

This requirement results from the exemption from property transfer tax expenses in connection with the acquisition of the Company, for which a corresponding provision exists.\n\nAs of the reporting date, temporary valuation differences between the commercial balance sheet and the tax balance sheet resulted in deferred tax assets in the amount of €5.6 million (previous year: €4.8 million).\n\nThe equity ratio on the balance sheet date was 69.7% (previous year: 62.1%).\n\nProvisions fell to €14.6 million in the financial year (previous year: €31.6 million) and relate in particular to personnel provisions for pensions and for bonus commitments to the Company's employees and employees of group companies as well as tax provisions. The sharp decline mainly relates to tax provisions and results from the advance payments made in the year under review with a declining tax base.\n\nThe liabilities essentially consist of loan liabilities to credit institutions and other lenders amounting to €177.6 million (previous year: €180.9 million) and those to affiliated companies in the amount of €1.5 million (previous year: €58.2 million). The loans from banks, other lenders and affiliated companies result, in particular, from the strategic alignment of financial management, with which corporate financing is taken up by the highest group company and free liquidity is bundled in the highest group company. They are then used within the group companies. The significant decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies is the result of the sideways merger of Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and the associated offsetting of receivables and liabilities.\n\n#### **Financial position**\n\nAs an objective of appropriate financial management, the Instone Group, through Instone Real Estate Group SE, provides sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the operational and strategic financial needs of the Group companies at all times in the management's view. As a listed company, Instone Real Estate Group SE considers the interests of shareholders and banks in its financial management. Instone Real Estate Group SE ensures an adequate ratio between equity and debt financing in the interests of these stakeholders at its discretion.\n\n### **Staff**\n\nAt the end of the year, around 97 members of staff were employed at Instone Real Estate Group SE (previous year: 104 employees)[. GRI 2-7](#page-286-0)\n\n### **Outlook**\n\nDue to its position as a strategic holding company, the company does not have its own operative business. Sales arise almost exclusively from the administrative services provided to group companies and the remuneration agreed for this purpose. At the same time, the Company accepts expenses for the salaries of employees of administrative central departments, the salaries of the Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, as well as for interest expenses for corporate financing, including guarantee commissions. The sum of these expenses exceeds the recoverable sales revenue.\n\nCompared to the previous year's outlook, earnings after tax fell by €11.4 million to €22.8 million, contrary to expectations. This is mainly due to the lower income from profit and loss transfer agreements compared to expectations. In particular for the subsidiary Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories had a significant impact on the annual profit for the year in the reporting year.\n\nThe Company receives significant income from existing profit and loss transfer agreements with subsidiaries, in particular with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH Due to the expected business development of this subsidiary , a significant increase in income from profit and loss transfers compared to the previous year is expected for the 2024 financial year. Because of the overall effects described, we expect earnings after tax for the 2024 financial year to be well above the previous year's figure.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-155-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and opportunities report**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Risk and opportunities report**\n\nThe risk management of the Instone Group is geared towards securing the successful, continued development and profitability of the Group in the long-term.\n\n#### **Risk management system** [TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\nAt the Instone Group, the risk management system is understood to mean the entirety of all organisational regulations and measures intended to identify business risks at an early stage and to counteract them with appropriate measures in good time. This is intended to secure the defined business goals and future success of the Instone Group. Unrecognised and therefore uncontrolled and unmanaged risks represent a high risk potential for the Instone Group. Systematic risk management reduces the risk potential and ensures the continuation of the Company, the preservation of jobs and the successful further development of the Instone Group.\n\nKey elements of the risk management system include the use of risk management software, quarterly risk identification measures, closely monitored, database-assisted project controlling, periodic reviews, internal approval processes for any far-reaching decisions, the ICS and the foureyes principle. The powers for individual decision-making levels are clearly regulated in the internal guidelines. The risk management process does not encompass a separate opportunities management function. The Instone Group assesses identified opportunities with regard to their impact on the planned results within the framework of existing planning and controlling processes.\n\nWe are continuously working to optimise the risk management system together with our independent partners. As a German stock corporation listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Instone Group is subject to the corresponding regulatory framework. As a result, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are also obliged to issue an annual declaration on the extent to which the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) have been observed. All applicable internal guidelines, rules of procedure and measures designed to ensure a Groupwide standardised and structured approach to risk management are reviewed internally on a regular basis and updated where applicable.  [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\nIn organisational terms, the Risk Management Department is part of the Controlling Department and reports directly to the Management Board, which bears overall responsibility for the risk management system. It makes decisions regarding the structural and procedural organisation of risk management and the provision of resources. The Board also adopts the documented risk management results and takes them into consideration in its management of the company. The Supervisory Board's audit committee monitors the findings of the risk management system. In the interest of key stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and investors, the Management Board pursues a conservative, safety-focused risk strategy, which also takes the sustainability of our activities into account.\n\nThe first and second levels of executives below the Management Board are called risk owners and in this role bear responsibility for identifying, evaluating, documenting, managing and communicating all material risks in their respective areas of responsibility. Every employee of the Instone Group is required to behave in a risk-aware manner, i.e. to be clear about the risk situation within their area of responsibility and to deal responsibly with identified risks.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nWithin the scope of the risk management process, the Risk Management Department coordinates the identification, evaluation, documentation and communication of risks. It consolidates the risk reports of the risk owners and prepares the report for the Management Board and Supervisory Board. This enables the Management Board to systematically identify and assess material risks within the Company or in the Company's environment in a timely manner and initiate appropriate countermeasures.\n\nIn our view, the risk management system of the Instone Group ensures the early identification, assessment, management and monitoring of all material risks. This also includes risks that exist beyond the financial risks processed in the Controlling Department, which can endanger not only the net assets and financial position of the Company, but also intangible assets such as the Company's reputation. Project risks are identified and evaluated in particular as part of the project controlling process. Project Controlling uses a central database-supported software programme, the data and reports of which are used for close coordination regarding the status of projects and potential risks – at both the project level and the company level. In this way, potential dangers that may affect the Company's value or performance are recognised at an early stage. Under this approach, environmental and company-specific early warning indicators are taken into account and the regional knowledge and perceptions of our nationwide employees are taken into consideration.\n\n#### Risk assessment\n\nBy means of a systematic process, the risk owners regularly identify, analyse and update all risks in their respective area of responsibility, with the support of risk assistants, if necessary, that arise by comparison with the applicable medium-term business plan. These are subdivided into the six risk categories \"general business risks\", \"compliance risks\", \"financial risks\", \"IT and communication risks\", \"project business risks\" and \"legal risks\" and their subcategories. The determined levels of loss and probabilities of occurrence are classified within specified ranges for each risk and documented in a Group-wide risk overview. EBT and liquidity are assessed to identify any plan variances over a three-year horizon.\n\nRisks are documented as gross risks and net risks, meaning that the probability of occurrence and damage impact are determined from two perspectives, both before (gross) and after (net) the effects of effective measures to be implemented. The goal is to control every risk with the help of measures. Countermeasures serve to avoid, reduce or transfer risks. However, risks must be accepted in some cases in which no countermeasures can be identified, for example, due to macroeconomic effects that cannot be influenced. Individual risks are assessed as severe if the corresponding net risks would have a serious impact and at least a medium probability of occurrence. Risks assessed as being severe are to be explicitly listed in the risk and opportunity report.\n\n| Probability of<br>occurrence | In %          | Extent of loss | EBT<br>In thousands<br>of euros | Liquidity<br>In thousands<br>of euros |\n|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Low                          | ≤ 10          | Low            | ≤ 4,000                         | ≤ 3,000                               |\n| Medium                       | > 10<br>≤ 25  | Moderate       | > 4,000<br>≤ 10,000             | > 3,000<br>≤ 9,000                    |\n| High                         | > 25<br>≤ 50  | Material       | > 10,000<br>≤ 20,000            | > 9,000<br>≤ 15,000                   |\n| Very high                    | > 50<br>≤ 100 | Severe         | > 20,000<br>≤ 40,000            | > 15,000<br>≤ 30,000                  |\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\nThis scheme creates an assessment matrix that categorises the individual risk notifications into a traffic light system (green, amber and red).\n\n#### **Risk assessment matrix**\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n### **Independent**\n\n**[auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Supervision of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is regularly updated and developed and particularly adapted to changes in the Company and/or the Instone Group. The Risk Management Policy describes the core elements of the risk management system and defines the responsibilities. This is amended continuously as necessary. Basic and coordinating activities related to the risk management system are carried out by the Controlling Department, communicated to the Risk Management Committee and if necessary approved by the Risk Management Committee and the Management Board of the Instone Group. This process includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- → Documentation and communication of rules for the risk management process at the Instone Group\n- → Definition, ongoing determination and review of the Company's riskbearing capacity\n- → Further development of existing risk management regulations\n- → Point of contact for all fundamental questions of risk management at the Instone Group\n\nImage /page/157/Figure/23 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix.

Extraordinary meetings are convened when needed.\n\n#### Reporting\n\nRisk management activities and results are documented in a quarterly risk report, which is made available to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board's audit committee is also informed about the risk situation four times a year. This reporting system ensures that both management and supervisory bodies are fully informed and that relevant operational early warning indicators are in place. In this way, undesirable developments can be detected in good time and countermeasures initiated at an early stage. If material risks occur suddenly, they are reported to the Management Board without delay.\n\n#### Internal Control System (ICS)\n\nThe ICS is closely linked to the risk management system and regulates the avoidance or limitation of risks with the aid of control measures. It is therefore aimed at safeguarding both the risks of financial/sustainability reporting and operational risks. The ICS is regularly adapted to the current risk situation of the Group. The accounting-related ICS ensures the accuracy and reliability of accounting and compliance with the legal requirements applicable to the Company. In addition, it ensures the effectiveness and profitability of the business activities. The focus is on the prevention and detection of asset misappropriation and the protection of the Company's assets. The ICS is the responsibility of the Management Board. The Management Board is responsible for set up, monitoring, effectiveness testing and development. The objective of the accountingrelated ICS within the meaning of the relevant regulations is to ensure the legal compliance and adequacy of financial reporting. For this purpose, the ICS is embedded in the Finance and Accounting Department. The finance and accounting department is responsible for guidelines for the adoption of accounting regulations and for the content and timing of the financial reporting process. From an organisational viewpoint, work on financial statements for all companies included in the consolidated financial statements is carried out by the parent company. All companies and branches included in the consolidated financial statements are located in an SAP environment. The entire Group is subject to uniform accounting/ valuation requirements, charts of accounts, account assignments, processes and process controls. The central control elements are the internal approval processes, the dual control principle and the required separation of functions. The Instone Group has an authorisation concept that is adapted to the job profiles of the respective employees.\n\n#### Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department prepares a risk-oriented audit schedule annually based on an analysis of all material business processes. After approval of the audit plan by the Management Board, the Internal Audit Department independently and autonomously audits compliance with the legal requirements and Group-wide guidelines for the control system. It assesses the functionality and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system and identifies possible optimisation potential for minimising risks in process execution and in the control environment. The individual audit reports are made available to the Management Board, the audited business units and the risk management system for the purpose of checking potential identified risks. This allows the Management Board to make timely adjustments to processes and to further develop the ICS that is already in place. The implementation of the measures specified in the audit reports is the subject of follow-up audits. The Management Board and the Audit Committee receive an annual report from the Internal Audit Department for informatio[n. GRI 205-1](#page-287-0)\n\n#### Risk-bearing capacity\n\nWithin the risk management system, ensuring the Company's risk-bearing capacity is a key objective at the Instone Group. The assessment of the overall operational risk by means of risk aggregation makes it possible to conclude whether a company's risk coverage potential is sufficient to cover all risks, also in the future. The risk-bearing capacity is determined by comparing the risk coverage potential with the respective overall risk exposures over the three-year planning horizon. It can therefore be interpreted as available EAT or liquidity cover funds after the consideration of the\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nidentified quantitative net risks. The risk-bearing capacity over time is considered cumulatively.\n\nThe overall risk exposure refers to the measure of risk that results from the aggregation of all quantitative net risks in the risk inventory according to their effects on EBT and liquidity. The overall EBT risk exposure is then converted to an overall EAT risk exposure.\n\nThe risk coverage potential is regularly determined by the Controlling Department and is incorporated into the risk-bearing capacity assessment logic. The basic scenario for the risk coverage potential is based on continued corporate planning, taking into account the existing projects of the project portfolio, while maintaining personnel and material cost planning. The risk coverage potential for comparing the overall risk exposure EAT is formed by IFRS equity or, in terms of liquidity, freely disposable cash and cash equivalents, including contractually guaranteed credit lines.\n\n#### **Current risk assessment**\n\nThe main risk categories and risk sub-categories at the Instone Group are described in the following condensed risk assessment. The description is based on the risk inventory as at 31 December 2023. The greatest risks in the risk sub-categories are explicitly mentioned in the descriptions. Risk sub-categories are divided into \"relevant\" and \"not relevant\". Risk sub-categories are assessed as relevant if they account for more than 5% of the overall risk situation assessed (total of expected values), if at least one risk is in the \"material\" or \"severe\" range or if the Instone Group Management Board makes a corresponding determination from its higher-level perspective.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, as in the previous year, the Instone Group identified the sales risk for all planned sales activities of the portfolio as a severe individual risk due to the macroeconomic effects described in the section \"General business risks\".\n\nAs in the previous year, a large part of the risk situation relevant to the Instone Group is derived from the market environment, which is characterised by high interest rates and decreased purchasing power. In addition, the Instone Group sees a tightening of lending standards by credit institutions, also influenced by raised regulatory requirements. As a result, in addition to the significant increase in debt financing costs, the Management Board is particularly also focusing even more on new\n\nfinancing and refinancing at the company and project level on the basis of risk management. Changes in the risk situation are continuously monitored, assessed and, if necessary, incorporated into the ongoing forecast.\n\nThe same risk sub-categories as in the 2022 Annual Report are assessed as relevant, as the risk situation has remained relatively constant compared to the previous year.\n\n#### General business risk[s TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\n#### **Global/national economy**\n\nThe Instone Group is dependent on the German residential real estate market, which is influenced by various macroeconomic and general factors, such as economic, demographic and political trends. The increasing geopolitical tensions in recent years have caused growing political and economic uncertainties throughout the world. Detrimental political and economic trends across the world and in Europe could have negative effects on the export-oriented German economy as a whole and may particularly lead to a higher unemployment rate, lower per capita purchasing power and rising economic uncertainty. Such factors may delay demand for residential property.\n\nThe surge in inflation since 2022 prompted an interest rate reversal on the part of both central banks and capital markets, leading to a rapid rise in interest rates. This led to an increase in financing costs, which has had a dampening effect on real estate demand. Institutional investors also exhibited considerable purchasing restraint due to changes in interest rates and the tougher macro environment. If central banks stick to a more restrictive monetary policy and keep key interest rates at the current levels, this could lead to persistently high financing costs, which could also continue to restrict demand for Instone Group's products. In addition, demographic and socio-economic trends in key markets for the Instone Group could have a considerable impact on residential property demand. Although the population in the most important population centres of Germany rose between 2008 and 2023 as a result of increasing urbanisation and a generally growing population in Germany, this trend could reverse or at least slow down. In 2023, growth was comparatively less strong than in the first two quarters of 2022, which were marked by large movements of Ukrainian refugees. Not taking immigration into account, a shrinking and ageing population is to be expected in Germany. Lower immigration rates could reduce demand, especially in the key markets of the Instone Group. At this point, however, it should be taken into\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n```\nOutlook\n```\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\naccount that adverse development for the Instone Group would only become noticeable after the housing shortage in Germany has been reduced (see the \"Economic framework\" section starting o[n page 129\\).](#page-128-0)\n\nHowever, the Instone Group has achieved broad regional diversification so that it can better respond to possible changes in the market. The Instone Group is represented in core cities and prosperous medium-sized of Germany, where it offers real estate in different price segments ranging from publicly subsidised housing to high-end housing. The project portfolio includes new construction projects as well as the renovation of listed buildings. Projects have been sub-divided into different building phases so that the Company can respond to differing market requirements in each phase. Also in sales, different customer groups such as owner-occupiers, investors and institutional investors are served. Despite this diversification and other measures, the impact of the remaining risk arising from the global and national economies is considered to be relevant.\n\n#### **Sector-specific regulatory risks**\n\nThe real estate industry is subject to a great many legal regulations and legally influenced operating conditions. Changes in these areas can necessitate adjustments and measures on the part of companies in the real estate sector, including the Instone Group. These may include, but are not limited to, legislative changes or adjustments to construction regulations such as the German Building Energy Regulation, as well as regulatory intervention in the real estate market in the form of rent controls on new builds or quotas on housing subsidies, for example, which are not currently covered by civil law. Risks are identified on a case-by-case basis as part of regular screening of changes to relevant legal framework conditions. In addition, changes to these legal framework conditions due to longer building permit processes, for example, can lead to delays in the implementation of real estate development projects.\n\nThe Instone Group is active in real estate interest groups such as the German Central Real Estate Committee (ZIA) in order to contribute its extensive experience accumulated from a wide variety of projects over many years. Furthermore, we examine possible regulatory developments when acquiring land and take them into consideration in drafting the contract or determining the purchase price.\n\nDue to the potential severe effects of regulatory risks and given that they cannot be ruled out due to the multi-year project periods, the Instone Group deems them to be relevant.\n\n#### **Market developments**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, approximately 88% of our portfolio (based on anticipated revenue volume after completion of development) was located in the most important population centres and metropolitan areas in Germany (Berlin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Cologne/Bonn, Leipzig, Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart) and approximately 12% in other prosperous medium-sized cities. The positive population and household trends and the continuing need for new housing are, in our view, favourable factors in the current real estate market. In recent years, increased demand for housing has been observed in major population centres and large cities. If growth in the population centres changes, that would pose a risk to the core markets of the Instone Group. The Instone Group is also looking into project opportunities outside the core cities to counteract such a development. With the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, which operates in the affordable housing segment, the target group that can be reached and the potential project locations in major population centres and beyond – especially in so-called B locations – will be significantly expanded. We monitor market developments and the situation of supply and demand very closely so we can react to any changes that may occur. The year 2023 was marked by falling sales prices and declining sales transactions across all residential property categories (new and existing construction of single, two and multi-family homes), particularly due to the fact that demand is not sufficiently supported by purchasing power and financing ability. The Instone Group currently expects the residential property market cycle to stabilise again in 2024 and continue to recover in the future. This expectation is supported by signs that interest rates are beginning to decline and the fact that the growing demand for housing, also due to the high rate of immigration, will come up against a relatively tight supply of housin[g. GRI 202](#page-286-0)\n\nAs the Instone Group is directly affected by changes in the market, the effects arising from market development risks are deemed to be relevant.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Staff**\n\nThe factors of globalisation and digitalisation have lasting effects on the labour market. Moreover, sustained inflation is shaping the labour market and is a particular challenge at the current time. To counteract this, the parties to the collective agreement decided back in February 2023 to pay an inflation bonus split between 2023 and 2024. Furthermore, it is expected that with the expiry of the currently valid collective bargaining agreement in March 2024, the issue of inflation compensation will be the focus of the negotiations. In addition to those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements who have taken inflation compensation into account under collective bargaining conditions, those not covered by such agreements and their salary structure are regularly reviewed by Instone.\n\nFurthermore, the shortage of skilled workers creates a dynamic in the market of job seekers that exposes a growing shortage of skilled workers. This is a strategic challenge because key positions can only be filled after a delay. There is a risk that knowledge transfer management cannot be optimally organised. In order to meet this challenge, the Instone Group has set itself the task of identifying key positions and pursuing active succession management. The Instone Group continually evaluates the age structure within the corporate group and analyses future search profiles. The aim is to devise countermeasures to avert a potential loss of know-how at an early stage.\n\nIn addition to attracting new specialists and young talent, retaining employees is a key concern and a strategic challenge given the persistent shortage of skilled workers. In this context, the Instone Group is continually developing talent development programmes in order to develop the company's potential on an ongoing basis. A key approach is the internal mentoring programme to support young managers in their leadership roles at the Instone Group. Under this programme, the mentees are supported by experienced mentors in a programme lasting two years. In addition, the programme gives young managers the chance to expand their internal networks and broaden their experience by attending various keynote lectures. For the Instone Group, employees are the face of the Company and the link to our customers and business partners. By targeting qualified personnel, the Company can fill key positions with highly trained employees. These initiatives have a positive impact on the image of the Instone Group brand. They also help to retain sufficiently qualified personnel.\n\nDue to its streamlined business structure, the Instone Group cannot rule out vacancies in positions requiring highly specialised and individual expertise due to absences due to illness, termination or holidays. This may present a risk in certain situations.\n\nOverall, we consider the impact of personnel risks to be relevant despite the measures implemented.\n\n#### **Reputation**\n\nTo some extent, the Instone Group's business and growth strategy partly depends on preserving the integrity of the brand and reputation of the Instone Group as a reliable partner and quality supplier.\n\nThe Instone Group's reputation could be damaged by a number of factors and events which the Instone Group may not be able to influence at all or only to a small degree. These include unethical or illegal behaviour by employees or business associates, working conditions, incidents on construction sites, extensive or significant construction defects and associated claims for damages, an inability to provide the services requested by customers, negative reports in the (social) media, as well as threatened or actual litigation. In addition, the debates surrounding regulatory issues such as housing affordability and sustainability issues could adversely affect the reputation of the Instone Group.\n\nThe Instone Group may also encounter disagreements with local authorities and/or regulators in connection with its activities, resulting in administrative proceedings and unfavourable orders, directives or decrees that could lead to financial losses and delays in the completion of development projects.\n\nWith the involvement of external partners, the Instone Group has coordinated and developed a communication strategy and action plans to be implemented in response to different events. Reports in the (social) media are monitored continually in order to be able to quickly respond to any relevant reports. Incorrect or poor communication with the capital market (analysts and investors) would present the risk that the Instone Group could fail to meet the expectations of the capital market. This could lead to a lasting loss of reputation that could have an impact on the valuation of the Company.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### [Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Company's aim is to be informed at all times about the current business and market developments within the Group through regular coordination of the specialist departments. This information policy forms the basis for external communication. The Group maintains an ongoing dialogue with the capital market (investors and analysts).\n\nDespite the established risk communication, the Instone Group considers the impact of potential reputation damage to be relevant.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy** [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0) [TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\nA detailed description of the Group's sustainability strategy and the resulting opportunities and risks can be found in the sustainability report starting o[n page 48.](#page-47-0) \n\nThe Instone Group is preparing to report in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), applying the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which will be mandatory for the Instone Group from financial year 2025 onwards. Since the 2022 reporting year, all major financial market participants have also been subject to a reporting obligation under the EU Taxonomy. The Instone Group is currently not required to report, but has been voluntarily reporting on its activities since the 2022 Annual Report. The ongoing and evolving legislative process is continuously monitored by the Instone Group.\n\nIn order to achieve the national climate targets in the long-term, new materials, new construction methods and new standards must be developed and implemented (target: climate-neutral 2045). Among other things, the focus is on reducing CO2 emissions and promoting the resourceconscious use of materials and using and recycling them in the context of the circular economy in the building sector. In reducing CO2 emissions, the Instone Group is also dependent on other industries such as the energy industry and their efforts to reduce emissions. The costs associated with a switch to recycled, reused and/or alternative natural building materials and materials for the Instone Group cannot yet be quantified. This is due in part to the volatility of prices for conventional, but also natural materials and building materials, but also in part to the fact that products made from recycled, reusable or natural materials are not always available on the market in sufficient quantities. The use of diverse and alternative building materials will lead to a broader supply in the future, which may have an impact on pricing.\n\nOther factors resulting from the derivation or implementation of climate targets, as well as the intensification of physical climate risks and preventive measures, may lead to higher project costs. Early consideration of physical climate risks in the planning process creates planning security and can increase the resilience of properties in the long-term.\n\nDifferent trends can be observed in the financial market. First, climate stress tests are being performed by investors and second, a change of investment behaviour can be observed, which supports climate-conscious decisions as long as they do not exceed a set cost framework. The Instone Group anticipates a steady increase in climate-conscious investment behaviour in the future. Failure to meet the emission reduction targets as a result of insufficient investments in climate protection or in sustainable product design can therefore result in a loss of revenue. The general market trend remains to be observed, but is generally positive for the Instone Group. For example, the company is building very low-CO2 and energy-efficient buildings that could potentially be priced higher than conventional buildings and therefore compensate for the additional costs of the sustainable transformation.\n\nThe risks of the sustainability strategy risk sub-category are considered relevant by the Instone Group.\n\n#### **Competition**\n\nThe German residential real estate market is highly competitive. This competition covers the entire value chain of the Instone Group's development activities. Competitors mainly consist of local real estate developers who have very good networking and specialist knowledge in these markets. Moreover, a few major competitors operate throughout Germany in the same regions and cities where the Instone Group is represented. In our view, the Instone Group is competing with these housing developers to acquire attractive development land, the availability of which is usually limited. Due to the changing market situation, however, competition for these properties eased in 2022 and 2023 due to the development of demand.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nNevertheless, the Instone Group is one of the leading project developers with expertise in urban property development and complex building law. With its established branch structure focusing on core cities and prosperous medium-sized cities, the Instone Group has continued its strategy of intensive, regionally adapted market development. The Instone Group achieves excellent networking results in the markets thanks to its regional structure. This enables us to achieve our targeted acquisition volume and gives the Instone Group access to interesting projects.\n\nThis risk is deemed to be relevant despite the lessened competition pressure and successfully implemented strategy.\n\n#### Compliance and data protection\n\nThe real estate and construction sectors are subject to various laws and regulations, which relate to compliance with price-fixing and data protection law and paying the minimum wage in addition to measures to combat illegal work, bribery and corruption as well as anti-money laundering, among other things. As a listed company, the Instone Group is also subject to a number of capital market regulations, compliance with which is required by law. The Instone Group depends on the compliance of all employees with applicable laws and the compliance guidelines of the Instone Group. The internal Group-wide compliance guidelines and procedures for further expanding compliance are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are up-to-date and revised as necessary. All employees and business partners of the Instone Group are obliged to comply with the Code of Conduct for employees and contractors. To ensure this, every employee must complete mandatory training on compliance and data protection.\n\nWith the help of our compliance and risk management procedures and monitoring mechanisms, we seek to detect and prevent any violations of the law and unethical behaviour, including corruption and terrorist financing, investigate indications of suspicious activity, and immediately detect contraventions. In addition, we want to ensure that our internal guidelines are also observed by our employees.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram illustrating compliance responsibilities.

A digital whistle-blower system is available to employees and third parties such as customers and business partners so that they can report any wrongdoing anonymously.\n\nAt the Instone Group, the Compliance Department is organisationally part of the Corporate Legal Department of Instone Real Estate Group SE, whose head reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board also deals with compliance issues and reports to the Supervisory Board on this subject. The Instone Group has also set up a\n\nCompliance Committee, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of the Legal Department and the Heads of Taxation, Finance and Accounting Department, the Head of the Human Resources Department and the Head of Controlling & Risk Management. The Compliance Committee deals with compliance-related topics, including the continuous optimisation of the compliance management system, on a regular basis.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were no legal proceedings due to anticompetitive behaviour, price-fixing or monopoly practices. In addition, there was no evidence of any relevant compliance violations at the Instone Group in the past financial year that have been confirmed. Nevertheless, the Instone Group will carefully investigate and respond to suspected cases of compliance. The Instone Group is currently not aware of any cases of corruption and therefore no meaningful risks have arisen in this area.  [GRI 206, 206-1](#page-287-0)\n\nNew, extensive data protection rules must be observed by the Instone Group in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on 24 May 2016 and has been applicable since 25 May 2018. The potential sanctions for non-compliance are considerable. The Instone Group has appointed an external Data Protection Officer who is available to all employees as a contact person. The Instone Group provides annual training to its employees and provides them with information materials from external data protection officers. The IT landscape of the Instone Group is adapted to the current laws and regulations. The technical and organisational measures taken to protect data are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date and offer little scope for cyber attacks. A potential data breach or non-compliance with other data protection regulations can have significant consequences. [GRI 418, 418-1](#page-288-0)\n\nDespite the measures implemented, there is still a residual risk that violations of data protection regulations may occur. In the past financial year, there were a total of three known cases of personal data violations, but they posed no risk or only a minor risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.\n\nDespite the measures implemented, there remains a residual risk. We consider the effects of these risks arising from the areas of compliance and data protection to be relevant.\n\n#### Financial risks\n\n#### **Banking partners**\n\nDeposits with our bank partners outside of deposit protection can be subject to a total loss in extreme scenarios. Existing financing may not be continued. Both risks can cause a liquidity bottleneck for the Instone Group, so that new acquisitions cannot be made or liabilities cannot be serviced. Furthermore, interest rate increases may cause the previous financing\n\nconditions to deteriorate, so that existing variable financing becomes more expensive or new financing can only be concluded on worse conditions. To counteract this, interest rate developments are monitored continuously and all planning elements are adjusted accordingly on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Instone Group has a Financial Risk Policy that specifies the concept and structure of bank selection. Financial transactions may only be concluded with the prior approval of the Management Board and only with approved banking partners. In order to assess creditworthiness, the Instone Group follows the general market observations of the individual credit institutions and reviews potential default risks in given cases. To minimise the risk of default, investments are distributed among several banks. We consider the potential impact of the risk to be relevant.\n\n#### **Financing structure**\n\nIn principle, financial covenants are agreed in the corporate financing contracts. Failure to comply with the financial covenants may involve the risks of more stringent financing conditions and extraordinary terminations of financing. A termination of financing would trigger immediate repayment and, via a cross default, also the repayment of other corporate finance. In the event of terminations and the associated premature repayment of the financing, refinancing would only be possible under worse conditions. The covenant requirements are continuously monitored and forecast by the Instone Group. Prior to investment decisions, the impact of the respective investment on the existing financial covenants is checked. The Instone Group believes that there is comfortable leeway with respect to this covenant.\n\nDue to continuous monitoring, the probability of occurrence of the violation of a financial covenant is low. Based on corporate planning, there are also no indications that the financial covenants cannot be serviced in the future. Nevertheless, non-compliance with the financial covenants would have a severe impact on the Company so we consider this risk to be relevant.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Interest**\n\nThe vast majority of our project financing and parts of corporate financing are concluded on the basis of variable interest rates. The reference interest rate is based on the requirements of the European Central Bank. If the noticeable increase in interest rates since the beginning of 2022 continues or worsens, our externally financed projects would have to bear higher interest costs and interest payments than currently calculated. The findings from ongoing interest rate monitoring are reassessed monthly in the project calculations.\n\nFurther interest increases would also exceed the calculated estimates for the project portfolio share with planned property and/or structural financing and would lead to additional costs and margin burdens. After detailed analysis, interest rate hedging instruments have not been entered into to date.\n\nIn view of the current interest rate environment, the Instone Group considers the potential impact of further interest rate increases to be relevant.  [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nThe solvency of the Company is monitored on an ongoing basis by continuously updating the liquidity forecast. The liquidity forecast structures anticipated cash flows in monthly time windows according to their origin so that the level of risk and probability can be identified in a targeted way and quantified. The respective specialist departments provide planned figures for higher-level cash flows. The resilience and feasibility of investment projects or strategic management decisions can be analysed with the help of scenario analyses in the overall context of the company-wide liquidity forecast.\n\nThe Group must maintain a minimum level of liquidity to ensure stable liquidity. As far as economically reasonable, debt financing is generally concluded for projects.\n\nDue to the current lack of visibility into the recurring stabilisation of the demand situation, the sales speeds in the existing projects and the associated payment returns from the medium-term planning are mapped very conservatively. Unforeseen further delays in payment returns can have a negative impact on the Company's liquidity.\n\nSufficient cash and cash equivalents were available throughout the financial year. There are no discernible circumstances that indicate a liquidity shortage.\n\nDespite the implemented measures, the Instone Group considers the potential impact of liquidity risk to be relevant due to the tremendous effects.\n\n#### **Tax**\n\nThe expansion of the Real Estate Transfer Tax Act to include the notional element of the change of shareholders in corporations could also lead to real estate transfer tax in existing structures in the case of listed real estate companies.\n\nRegular tax audits may reveal tax risks that might reach a relevant level when they occur.\n\nThe current tax audit for the years 2014 to 2016 of the Instone Group is expected to end in the first quarter of 2024. Any findings that could arise from this are taken into account by suitable provisions. The ongoing tax audit of the Instone Group companies for the assessment periods 2017 to 2019 is expected to end in 2024. The basis for the conservative tax declaration is provided by accounting which uses the described ICS. The ICS aims to ensure the accuracy of the disclosures.\n\nThe possible effects from tax risks are considered to be relevant.  [GRI 207-1, 207-2](#page-287-0)\n\n#### Project business risks\n\nProject risks are recorded, evaluated and summarised in reports. Based on this information, meetings are held monthly in the project team and in forecast and result discussions with the Management Board. The risks associated with approved projects or upcoming acquisitions and their respective mitigations are discussed and determined during these meetings.\n\nThe various levels of management are granted clearly defined decisionmaking powers, including those relating to project management. For example, each new project (this also applies to the approval of the initiation of sales) is approved by the Management Board and, in the case of larger projects, also by the Supervisory Board. If projects run the risk of\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-167-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\ndeviating from key approved parameters, this must be explained and discussed with the Management Board within the scope of the monthly forecast and result meetings. In addition, in the decision-making process preceding the investment approval, the investment capacities of the coming years will be examined on the basis of the existing project portfolio and with the addition of the investment measure applied for. From the time of approval, each project must be fully taken into account in the ongoing planning process until it has been handed over in full or until the decision to dispose of it.\n\n#### **Business partner selection and contractor retention**\n\nThe Instone Group relies on the provision of construction and other services by external suppliers and contractors for the realisation of its development projects. Such outsourced services in particular include architectural and engineering services as well as all construction services. Although the nationwide increase in construction volume from previous years stagnated in the 2023 financial year, bottlenecks could also arise in the future on the supplier and execution side due to business closures and insolvency.\n\nIf the Instone Group is unable to find qualified and reliable contractors for its development projects, that could hamper its ability to complete projects on time within the stipulated limit and in the requisite quality.\n\nAs part of its corporate strategy, the Instone Group relies on its regional and partially cross-regional networks to engage qualified and reliable contractors, most of whom have long-standing relationships with the Instone Group, with a correspondingly long-term lead. In addition to maintaining a consistently high quality, these measures also serve to ensure the sustainable safeguarding of resources on the market. The Instone Group has also set out guidelines indicating the evidence to be provided by contractual partners in order to prove their qualifications and reliability.\n\nFurthermore, a lack of cost certainty in projects due to late subcontracting to subcontractors may lead to projects or individual sections of projects being implemented inefficiently. Cost increases due to short-term contracts and the resulting insufficient market penetration may have a negative impact on project results.\n\nThe implementation standards of our projects are subject to continuous development in order to adapt them to current state-of-the-art technology and the requirements of our customers. To ensure a high degree of cost certainty is achieved for the individual projects, the Project Service department, before sales release by the Management Board, carries out cost calculations for all projects on the basis of the individual costs of the partial services and can draw on the key cost figures and experience from the entire projects of the Instone Group. For the continuous verification of our cost approach, we regularly create post-calculations based on the actual costs incurred per project and transfer the knowledge gained from this to the ongoing calculation process.\n\nFurthermore, we also reduce cost risks by agreeing long-term partnerships with our contractors and by awarding contracts to contractors as early as possible for the most important contract work. Structural work, building envelope and technical building equipment. The Instone Group assesses the potential impact of the risks to be relevant and takes steps to protects itself against these risks in each individual case at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n#### **Approval process**\n\nDue to the possibility that the desired target building right with regard to an economically viable use cannot be achieved or can only be achieved with a considerable delay with the investment approval, there is a risk of selling a property without being built up. Furthermore, inadequate capacities of government agencies and changes in local government committee meetings could mean that processes such as obtaining planning rights and building permits may not be completed on time. This can lead to shifts in the sales and construction starts and, as a result, to subsequent realisation of earnings and return on payments for our projects.\n\nThe Instone Group relies on a strong regional network and expertise and maintains close contacts with the competent government agencies to reduce the risk of delayed project implementation due to delays in obtaining building rights. Any challenges during the procurement of construction rights are analysed in detail. Outstanding issues are clarified in dialogue with local authorities and community representatives. In the event of a high number of building applications, however, there may be delays in the process which could have a negative impact on the planned implementation schedule. In exceptional cases, the acquired land will need to be resold if construction rights are not granted. Due to the large project portfolio, such delays can often be addressed by re-prioritising the project implementation so that the impact is absorbed at Group level. The Instone Group considers the potential impact of this risk to be relevant.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Project implementation/construction**\n\nA number of risks can arise during project implementation, causing a delay to the start of construction or the late completion of the development project. Such delays can also lead to an increase in construction costs that the Instone Group may not be able to compensate for. As a result, under some circumstances the Instone Group may not be able to sell some or all its development properties on profitable terms. In order to avoid the risk of building cost increases, the Instone Group strives to agree fixed prices with all contractual partners for the duration of the respective project construction period. If this is not successful in individual cases, it is possible to coordinate sliding price clauses, which are agreed transparently on a sub-section basis based on construction cost indices according to Destatis. In addition, construction delays and any resulting delayed handovers can trigger contractually regulated rights of withdrawal and contractual penalties. In addition, this may also result in claims for damages on the part of the buyers and investors. In order to avoid such risks, possible project delays are subject to monthly monitoring with regard to their contractual provisions and the implementation of countermeasures.\n\nThe refurbishment of listed buildings involves special risks associated with the essence of the building. This could lead to risks in terms of costs and time delays. These specific cost and deadline risks are part of our project planning and costing. Our branch office in Leipzig, which has many years of experience in the renovation of listed buildings, can transfer the experience of already successfully developed projects to the new projects, thus reducing or eliminating unexpected risks.\n\nThe effects on raw materials markets, energy costs, production capacities, supply chains and price increases caused by the war in Ukraine in 2022 were less likely to affect costs and processes in 2023. All year round, material prices stagnated at a high level, and in a few sub-segments (for example wood, concrete steel) they showed a significant decline. The same was true for energy costs. Nevertheless, the price trend must still be regarded as volatile. Further geopolitical events and their consequences can again have a strong impact on prices. Supply chains have largely returned to normal, not least due to declining demand. From today's perspective, we expect stable material and sub-section prices on average in the coming years. Although there are also external market estimates of falling construction prices, it cannot be ruled out that the price trend will pick up again due to unforeseen events and that the economic viability of our projects will be adversely affected.\n\nThe continuing tense situation on the German construction and real estate market can also be seen in 2023 as the number of company insolvencies rises. In isolated cases, the potential insolvency of our contractors can lead to construction delays and additional costs. In addition, the development of construction companies is also restricted by the banks' cautious and cautious business activities. This makes it more difficult for companies to obtain new loans , for example to compensate for pre-financing costs for larger orders. This development will also influence the contractor portfolio of the Instone Group.\n\nIn order to be able to identify possible risks and effects at an early stage , internal purchasing risk management is structured in such a way that monitoring of the contractual partners must be actively initiated during the contract award phase by calling up a financial information. Each change in the respective company (e.g. in terms of financial position, legal form, change of management) is then re-evaluated and automatically reported to the requester via monitoring for one year. For verification purposes, in individual cases, a second information about another business service is also requested.\n\nDue to climate change, more and more weather events can occur, which restrict future construction activity to the extent that construction progress can slow down due to heavy rain, heat, cold or storms, for example. The Instone Group is protected by insurance against damage, but not against delays. Any events that involve delays in the construction process can lead to a later generation of revenue. In addition, delays due to late completion of construction work can lead to the elimination of already approved funding.\n\nThe Instone Group makes every effort to identify and evaluate all potential project risks at an early stage. The purpose of the regular meetings at project, branch and Group level is, among other things, to closely support the project and discuss potential risks at an early stage in order to consider the further course of action together. The Instone Group encourages communication between its employees to support knowledge transfer. This allows them to pass on specialist knowledge to each other. All projects are conservatively forecast in the Controlling System and brought up to date with the current state of knowledge.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the potential effects of these risks to be relevant.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Marketing/sales** [GRI 417, 417-2, 417-3](#page-288-0)\n\nBefore sales begin, it may be possible to apply market prices that can no longer be implemented at the time of the sale, so that the marketing and sales process of the Instone Group would be slower or more cost-intensive.\n\nIn our opinion, the purchase restraint described in the chapter \"Project business at a glance\" in the 2023 financial year will not resolve abruptly in 2024. In line with the current market situation, the company's forecast therefore continued to take account of the reduced speed of sales compared to the level prior to the crisis. There could also be further reductions, including a temporary stop to the sales process. It cannot be ruled out that the purchase prices will be significantly reduced compared to current price assumptions in order to improve sales performance.\n\nOur risk management ensures that the planned revenues and schedules for each project are analysed and scrutinised critically by the Management Board during the approval and sales release processes. We use our presale quota to test the project development concept and planned sales prices in terms of market acceptance. If the concept is not accepted or, for example, if sales expectations are not achievable, the project will be re-adjusted and rechecked. This is intended to identify and implement alternative sales channels and product modifications.\n\nAs in the previous year , the sales risk for all planned marketing activities of the portfolio represents a severe individual risk as of 31 December 2023, because it has a severe damage impact and a high probability of occurrence.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the potential effects of these risks to be relevant.\n\n#### IT and communication risks\n\nThe Instone Group relies on dependable, efficient IT systems for its operations and uses complex, customised IT systems to manage all phases of its development activities along the value chain. The Instone Group's IT systems may fail or be disrupted by events that are entirely or partially beyond the control of the Instone Group. The systems may be vulnerable to unauthorised access and data loss (inside or outside the Group), computer viruses, malware, cyber security attacks and the interception or misuse of information transmitted or received by the Instone Group.\n\nThe Instone Group has implemented extensive data security measures and is constantly working to keep pace with developments and meet the needs of the IT industry. To ensure this, the Instone Group relies on specialist service providers and renowned manufacturers. In addition, the legal requirements, for example, from the European General Data Protection Regulation, are taken into account when designing IT systems.\n\nThe server infrastructure of the Instone Group is fully implemented in the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform in the EU and is redundant due to the data storage in the Microsoft data centres in Amsterdam and Dublin. Continuously updated defence systems, client and identity management systems for all mobile devices, apps and user accounts, as well as a 24/7 Cloud Security Operation Centre of a commissioned specialist service provider protect the infrastructure against external cyber attacks. Multi-level data storage systems allow the complete recovery of all data. The measures taken ensure a minimum risk of failure and a high level of data security, in our opinion.\n\nThe Instone Group does not consider the possible effects of IT and communication risks to be relevant due to the IT concepts that it has implemented.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Legal risks\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Liability and insurance**\n\nAs the warranty period extends over several years, the risk of warranty claims continues long after completion of the projects. This could lead to costs which were not factored in. The Instone Group, working together with its contractors, strives to hand over real estate of defect-free or nearly defect-free quality and therefore prevent any potential claims. The Instone Group is also entitled to assert the buyers' claims against the executing contractor.\n\nWhile the Instone Group is insured against fire, natural disasters, business interruption and third-party liability, the insurance contracts are subject to exclusions (such as terrorist attacks) and liability limitations for claims and insured events. The assessments of the insurance brokers commissioned by Instone Group to develop the insurance concept are based on qualified, industry-specific risk assessments. Exclusions and liability limitations have been individually defined with specific reference to the Instone Group products according to the probability of occurrence and possible effects.\n\nIn a specific, foreseeable individual case, the existing insurance concept can be subsequently expanded by individual contract adjustments or additional insurance policies, so that risks currently subject to exclusion or their effects could be covered.\n\nOn the basis of an extensively coordinated insurance package, we assume that we are adequately insured against the most common types of damage. We consider the potential effects of this risk to be relevant.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n- **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n- [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n- [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Report on opportunities**\n\nThe Instone Group defines its opportunities as a positive deviation from corporate planning, similar to risks. In addition to the risks mentioned, we believe that the current prevailing market conditions and forecasts for market development, based on the Group's valuation scheme, give rise to opportunities for the Instone Group, which will bring the current adverse market situation back to a higher price and margin level in the mediumterm to long-term. These include:\n\n- → Sustained high demand for housing and associated rent increases\n- → Rising population in conurbations\n- → Expansion of demand to the outskirts of the conurbations\n- → High willingness to invest in sustainable residential properties\n- → Socially and politically demanded sustainability in building efficiency\n- → Establishing efficiency-enhancing planning and construction processes for our nyoo product in the core business to create affordable and sustainable living space\n- → Attractiveness of residential developments through proximity to services, integrative concepts and social infrastructure\n- → Social and political pressure for the realisation of subsidised housing\n\nThe low leverage and high liquidity reserves of the Instone Group in conjunction with our nationwide presence and very good networking, our development competence with regard to urban districts with complex building regulations and our good reputation among municipal and institutional decision-makers provide the financial framework and the confidence to be able to use the opportunities arising from land acquisitions for the realisation of large-scale and complex projects in terms of volume to an even greater extent. From this position, the Instone Group also sees itself sufficiently prepared to take advantage of attractive purchasing opportunities from the current precarious environment of the real estate market.\n\nThe Instone Group is one of the largest German project developers in residential real estate and is represented nationwide in the most in demand conurbations in Germany. The majority of other German residential developers only have a local presence. They have very good networks in the market environment, but their potential project volume is generally smaller than the size of our projects.\n\nIn view of the properties it has already acquired and will still acquire, we see opportunities for the Instone Group to increase the commercial exploitation of properties in terms of gross floor area (GFA), site occupancy ratio (SOR) and floor area ratio (FAR), given the Group's many years of experience in this business.\n\nThe Instone Group pursues a value-oriented business model that is geared to growth, social and environmental sustainability and the interests of all relevant stakeholders. The objective is underpinned by a high degree of transparency, a comprehensive sustainability report that goes far beyond the legal requirements and the continued dialogue with all our stakeholders. This gives us further opportunities to be able to act successfully in line with our growth strategy.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Management Board's overall assessment of the risk and opportunities situation**\n\nAll things considered, the overall assessment of the risk situation for the Instone Group as at 31 December 2023 and the forecast for the current financial year continue to show a significantly adverse macroeconomic risk situation.\n\nOur forecast assessment is based on the assumption that we reached a bottom in terms of the price trend and number of transactions for residential real estate sales in the Federal Republic of Germany in 2023 and that we will see a modest recovery of the sales volume of our residential real estate products in calendar year 2024. Nevertheless, the risks are still high, especially in terms of sales speeds and sales prices, given that the timing of a trend reversal cannot be predicted exactly. The Management Board has adopted a series of measures to address this situation. Where possible, sales of the Instone Group products and construction starts will be carried out on a more detailed and sequential basis in order to minimise the risks of residual materials. The acquisition of properties will be much more selective. Liquidity and debt will continue to be the main focus of management decisions. The Management Board will continue to monitor developments closely and has prepared appropriate options for action in all relevant scenarios.\n\nOn the construction cost side, the Management Board that prices of materials and construction services will remain stable. It is currently not possible to conclusively assess the extent to which the declining demand for tradesman services would also lead to sustainable price advantages for the Instone Group.\n\nAny continued restraint in the case of new acquisitions will, according to current estimates, have a negative impact on the recovery of the growth momentum of the company in the medium-term.\n\nThe current financing environment has direct implications for the ability to finance individual existing projects as well as new acquisitions.\n\nProject-specific municipal decision-making processes, which are particularly related to the creation of planning and construction laws, remain risky and not always predictable in terms of time.\n\nFrom today's perspective, the Management Board of the Instone Group does not consider there to be any risks that the Company would be unable to adequately counteract or which could affect the results of operations, net assets and financial position in a way that could jeopardise the Group's continuation as a going concern.\n\nOverall, the macroeconomic risks and the associated risks of sales remain significantly increased. The Management Board has responded to these risks by implementing a series of measures aimed in particular at securing the company's balance sheet strength for all relevant scenarios and also enabling the company to benefit from the acquisition opportunities that can be expected in the medium-term.\n\nThe current risk situation was taken into consideration in the forecast.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-173-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n**Outlook**\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Outlook**\n\n#### **General economic and industry economic conditions**\n\nIn a crisis-ridden environment, the German economy as a whole is still in a weak phase. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, priceadjusted gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 0.3% in 2023. The restrictions on global trade caused by geopolitical tensions for the exportfocused German economy, the effects of the energy crisis and the rise in interest rates have been key factors in this. Higher energy costs and general inflationary trends put a heavy burden on manufacturing companies and consumers. The significantly higher interest rates resulting from the surge in inflation had a significant impact on the real estate and construction industry, which had previously benefited from very low interest rates.\n\nFor 2024 , the Deutsche Bundesbank anticipates a modest recovery of the German economy and moderate GDP growth of 0.4%. The Bundesbank expects that expanding international sales markets will have a positive impact on export demand and that falling inflation combined with significant wage increases should have positive effects on private consumer demand. The Bundesbank expects that German GDP growth will accelerate slightly to +1.2% in 2025. Due to the fall in inflation, the majority of economists also expect the ECB to take advantage of the leeway in terms of monetary policy and to initiate a rate reversal with several interest rate cuts.\n\nThe labour market remained robust despite the difficult economic environment. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, the average number of employed people in Germany rose further rise by an average of 333,000 people (+0.7%) despite the decline in economic output. According to the German Federal Employment Agency, the unemployment rate in Germany increased slightly year-on-year to 5.7% in December 2023 (previous year: 5.4%) year on year. This increase is\n\nlargely due to the forced migration of Ukrainians. The German Federal Employment Agency assumes that this effect accounts for 0.4 percentage points. The Bundesbank expects that this high level of employment can be maintained in 2024. However, due to the higher numbers of refugees, this can lead to an annual increase in registered unemployed.\n\nIn the past year, the market for residential real estate in Germany continued to be affected particularly by the sharp rise in interest rates. The increase in financing costs led to a slump in investment in residential real estate for both private and institutional buyers. At the same time, the structural supply-demand imbalance in the German market has been exacerbated by construction projects that have been postponed in part. While some 270,000 residential units were completed in Germany in 2023, the ifo Institute expects that only 225,000 residential units will be completed in 2024 and 175,000 residential units in 2025. Thus, the German federal government's target of 400,000 new residential units per year was again missed by a wide margin.\n\nPrices for newly built residential units in Germany in the top 7 cities fell moderately in 2023. According to data from the consulting and analysis company bulwiengesa, the average year-on-year price trend in the individual cities is around 4%.\n\nFor 2024, we expect prices for new construction properties to stabilise in Germany's most attractive metropolitan regions, as the still very tight supply in these regions will be accompanied by substantial and growing surplus demand. The high energy efficiency of new buildings is another factor stabilising the prices of our products. Unrenovated older buildings with a poor energy balance have lost value the fastest in the last two years.\n\nConstruction costs continued to rise in the past year, albeit with a marked decline in upwards momentum. Construction prices for newly built residential units have increased by +4.3% year-on-year in the time until November 2023. The Management Board of the Instone Group expects construction costs to be stable on average in 2024.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n**[Outlook](#page-173-0)**\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Outlook for the Instone Group**\n\nThe development of the macroeconomic and industry environment has a significant effect on the forecasts presented below. Another important prerequisite is the achievement of significant milestones in our projects. Other essential factors particularly include the creation of building rights and the granting of building permits, announced sales launches, meeting planned targets for the speed of sales, expected construction starts and the planned construction progress of projects.\n\nAny deviation from the management's assumptions regarding the development of the macroeconomic and industry environment, any changes in political factors or the risks and opportunities already described in the section \"Risk and opportunities report\" [page 156 o](#page-155-0)f this combined management report or any changes in project schedules may cause the actual business performance to differ from the forecasts, in the opinion of the Management.\n\nAs in the previous year, the negative effects of the significantly higher level of interest rates on demand were taken into account by the assumption of a lower speed of sales compared to the historical average. In an industry environment characterised by reduced forecasting certainty, we also assumed an even smaller number of transactions with institutional investors compared to the historical average.\n\nOn the basis of the assumptions made and taking the current uncertainties into account, we expect the sales volume to pick up significantly in 2024 compared to 2023, although we continue to expect that the volume of sales contracts will be lower than the historical average, at more than €300 million.\n\nWe are forecasting adjusted revenue of €500 million to €600 million for 2024, largely on the basis of already secured sales and expected new sales.\n\nFor the project mix that is relevant for revenue recognition, we expect a gross profit margin of around 22%.\n\nAdjusted consolidated earnings after tax are forecast to be in the range of €30 million to €40 million.\n\nAdjusted consolidated earnings after tax also form the basis for determining the profit distribution. The target figure for the expected payout ratio is 30% of adjusted consolidated earnings.\n\n| Forecast of key management performance indicators for 2024 in millions of euros | TABLE 045    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                 | 2024 outlook |\n| Revenue (adjusted)                                                              | 500-600      |\n| Gross profit margin (adjusted) as a %                                           | ~22%         |\n| Consolidated earnings after tax (adjusted)                                      | 30-40        |\n| Volume of sales contracts                                                       | >300         |\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-175-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**Other disclosures**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Other disclosures**\n\n### **Takeover law disclosures**\n\nThe legal acquisition disclosures are shown below in accordance with Sections 315a and 289a HGB:\n\n#### **1 Composition of the share capital**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the share capital (registered capital) of Instone Real Estate Group SE amounted to €46,988,336.00.

Furthermore, they may also be issued by companies dependent on the Company or majorityowned by the Company; in this case, the Management Board is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to assume the guarantee for the Bonds on behalf of the Company and to grant the holders of such Bonds option or conversion rights to shares in the Company and to make further declarations required for a successful issue and to take actions. Issues of bonds can be divided into sub-bonds with equal rights.\n\nThe Management Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights to bonds (i) in order to exclude fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio from shareholders' subscription rights to the bonds, (ii) in order to issue bonds against cash payment, provided that this is done at an issue price that is in line with the recognised issue price, however, this authorisation to exclude subscription rights only applies to the extent that the shares issued or to be issued to service the option or conversion rights or to fulfil the conversion obligation do not account for more than 10% of the registered capital. The registered capital figure on the effective date of this authorisation is decisive when calculating this limit. If the registered capital is lower at the time the authorisation pursuant to number (ii) is exercised, this lower figure shall be used. This amount shall include the pro rata amount of the registered capital, (x) which is attributable to shares that have been or will be issued during the term of this authorisation until its utilisation from authorised capital to the exclusion of the subscription right pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 of the AktG, (y) which is attributable to treasury shares in the Company that have been or will be sold on the basis of authorisations pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the AktG during the term of\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nthis authorisation until its utilisation to the exclusion of the subscription right of shareholders pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, and (z) which is attributable to shares that are or will be issued to service warrant or convertible bonds issued or to be issued during the term of this authorisation until its utilisation on the basis of another authorisation in similar application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG to the exclusion of the subscription right. Finally, the Management Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights to bonds (iii) to the extent necessary to grant subscription rights to the holders of bonds with warrants or convertible bonds (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority interest to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising their rights or fulfilling their obligations.\n\nBonds may only be issued with the exclusion of subscription rights if the total of the new shares to be issued on the basis of such bonds, together with new shares from authorised capital or treasury shares of the Company, which are issued or sold by the Company during the term of this authorisation until it is exercised by utilising another authorisation with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights, and, together with rights issued during the term of this authorisation until it is exercised by exercising another authorisation under exclusion of subscription rights and which enable or oblige the conversion into or subscription to shares of the Company, no more than 10% of the registered capital is arithmetically allotted. The basis for calculating the 10% limit of the registered capital is the registered capital figure at the time of effective date of this authorisation. If the registered capital figure is lower at the time the authorisation is exercised, this lower figure shall be used.\n\nIn the case of convertible bonds, the holders shall have the right to exchange their bonds for new shares in the Company in accordance with the specific conditions. The conversion ratio is calculated by dividing the nominal value of a bond by the fixed conversion price for a new share in the Company. The conversion ratio may also be calculated by dividing the issue amount of a bond below the nominal amount by the fixed conversion price for a new share in the Company. The conversion ratio can be rounded up or down to a whole number; in addition, an amount to be paid in cash can be set. Finally, it can be stipulated that fractions can be combined and/or compensated for in cash. The proportionate amount of the registered capital represented by the shares of the Company to be issued per bond may not exceed the nominal amount of the bond or an issue price of the bond that is lower than the nominal amount.\n\nThe conditions may provide for the right of the Company to pay the holders of the conversion right the equivalent value in cash instead of the shares in the Company in the event of conversion; the value in cash is to be calculated in accordance with the specific conditions and shall correspond to the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the share in the Company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Xetra (or a comparable successor system) during the last ten trading days before the conversion was declared. The conditions may also provide for the right of the Company to grant the holders of the conversion right treasury shares in the Company or new shares from an authorised capital in the event of conversion. The conditions may also provide for a conversion obligation at the end of the term or at another time.\n\nThe conditions may provide for the right of the Company to grant the creditors of the bonds, in whole or in part, new shares or treasury shares in the Company in lieu of the payment of a due amount of money. The shares are credited with a value which, in accordance with the specific conditions, is based on the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the shares in the Company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Xetra (or a comparable successor system) during the last ten exchange trading days before the sum is due.\n\nWhen issuing warrant bonds, one or more warrants shall be attached to each partial bond, entitling the holder to purchase shares in the Company in accordance with the conditions. The conditions may stipulate that those entitled to exercise the warrant bonds are either granted treasury shares in the Company or new shares from authorised capital. The proportional amount of the registered capital in the shares of the Company to be acquired per warrant bond may not exceed the exercise price of the warrant bond.\n\nThe option or conversion price for a share must be at least 80% of the arithmetic mean of the stock exchange prices of the Company's shares in the Xetra closing auction on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a comparable successor system), and indeed, (i) if the subscription right is excluded or subscription rights trading does not take place for another reason during the ten exchange trading days before the day that the resolution is passed by the Management Board on the issue of the bonds or otherwise, (ii) during the exchange trading days on which subscription rights to bonds are traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with the exception of the last two exchange trading days of the subscription right trading.\n\n←\n\n===\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe option and conversion price will then be reduced, without prejudice to Section 9 (1) AktG, on the basis of an antidilution clause in accordance with more detailed provisions of the terms and conditions by payment of a corresponding amount in cash when the conversion right is exercised or by reduction of the additional payment, if, during the option or conversion period, the Company increases the registered capital or issues further bonds or grants or guarantees option or conversion rights while granting subscription rights to its shareholders, and the holders of existing option or conversion rights are not granted subscription rights to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising their option or conversion rights.\n\nInstead of a payment in cash or a reduction of the additional payment, the exchange ratio may also be adjusted, as far as possible, by dividing by the reduced conversion price. The conditions may also provide for a valuepreserving adjustment of the option or conversion price even for other measures taken by the Company that may lead to a dilution of the value of the option or conversion rights, as well as in the event of a capital reduction, a stock split or a special dividend.\n\nSubject to compliance with the above provisions, the Management Board is authorised to determine the further details of the issue and terms of the Bonds and their conditions or to determine them in agreement with the corporate bodies of the Group Company issuing the Bonds, in particular the interest rate, issue price, term and denomination, subscription or exchange ratio, creation of a conversion obligation, determination of an additional cash payment, compensation for or combination of fractional amounts, cash payment instead of delivery of shares, option or conversion price and the option or conversion period.\n\nUntil now, the Management Board has not made use of its authorisation to issue warrants or convertible bonds.\n\n#### 7.4 Authorisation for the Company to acquire its own shares\n\nBy the resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 13 June 2019, the Management Board was authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to acquire treasury shares from the end of this Annual General Meeting until 12 June 2024 up to a total of 10% of the registered capital of €36,988,336 or the lower share capital figure at the time the authorisation is exercised, by being able to exercise the authorisation in full or in partial amounts, once or several times. However, the shares acquired on the basis of the authorisation, together with other shares in the Company that the Company has already acquired and still owns, may not\n\naccount for more than 10% of the existing registered capital at any time. The authorisation may also be exercised by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake or by third parties for the account of the Company or by its dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake. On the basis of the authorisation, the Company may also agree with one or more banks or other companies meeting the requirements of Section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG that they will deliver to the Company a predetermined number of shares or a predetermined euro equivalent of shares in the Company within a predefined period, whereby the price at which the Company acquires these shares must in each case show a discount to the arithmetic mean of the volume-weighted average prices of the Company's shares in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over a previously determined number of trading days. The banks or other companies meeting the requirements of Section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG must undertake to purchase the shares to be delivered on the stock market at prices that are within the range that would apply if the shares were purchased directly on the stock exchange by the Company itself under this authorisation.\n\nThe purchase must be made via the stock market or by means of a public offer directed at all shareholders in the Company. If the purchase of the shares is made on the stock market, the purchase price (excluding incidental acquisition costs) must be no more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean value of the share prices (final auction prices of the Instone Real Estate Group SE shares in Xetra or a comparable successor system) on the stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main on the last three exchange trading days before the acquisition or the undertaking of an obligation to purchase. In the case of a purchase via a public offer, the Company may either publish a formal offer or publicly request the submission of offers for sale. The purchase price offered (excluding incidental acquisition costs) or the limit values of the purchase price range per share set by the Company (excluding incidental acquisition costs) must be no more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean value of the share prices (final auction prices of the Instone Real Estate Group SE share in Xetra or a comparable successor system) on the stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main on the last three exchange trading days before the publication of the purchase offer or the invitation to tender. In the event of an amendment of an offer, the date of publication of the offer adjustment shall replace the date of publication of the purchase offer. If the Company publicly solicits the submission of offers to sell, the day of acceptance of the offers to sell shall take the place of the day of publication of the offer to buy or of the adjustment of the offer to buy.

The basis for calculating the 10% limit is the registered capital figure at the time of effective date of this authorisation. If the registered capital is lower at the time the authorisation is exercised in accordance with number (iii), this lower value shall be used. Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised to use the treasury shares acquired on the basis of this authorisation under the conditions described above, (iv)\n\nto fulfil obligations of the Company arising from conversion and option rights or conversion obligations from convertible bonds or bonds with warrants (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent or majority-owned companies of the Company, and (v) to grant subscription rights to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent or majority-owned companies of the Company to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising the rights or obligations arising from the aforementioned instruments.\n\nThe authorisations pursuant to numbers (i) to (v) may also be exercised by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake or by third parties for the account of the Company or its dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake.\n\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, on 10 February 2022 the Management Board approved the acquisition of up to 2,349,416 shares (share buyback programme 2022/I) and on 25 October 2022 the acquisition of up to 1,349,417 shares (share buyback programme 2022/II), in other words up to 3,698,833 shares in total using the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 13 June 2019 for the acquisition of its own shares. As part of share buyback programme/I and share buyback programme/II, the Company bought back a total of 3,698,833 shares, of which it currently still holds 3,665,761 shares.\n\nThe Management Board has therefore fully exhausted the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting to acquire the Company's own shares passed on 13 June 2019.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **8 Key agreements reached by the Company in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid, and the consequent effects**\n\nIndividual contracts of corporate financing of the Company provide for a special termination right of the other party in the event of a change of control (partly defined as the acquisition of a majority interest by voting rights or equity interest, partly defined as holding more than 30% of the voting rights in the Company).

Under the employment contract of a Management Board member, the conclusion of a control and/or profit transfer agreement with the Company as obligated parties does not qualify as a significant adverse effect in the running of the business under certain conditions.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-181-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **Corporate governance statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Corporate governance statement (unaudited)**\n\nIn this report, Instone Group provides information about the Company's corporate governance in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) on the principles of corporate governance and Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). In addition to the Declaration of Compliance with the GCGC, the corporate governance statement also contains information about corporate governance and the compliance management system, the composition and working methods of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as well as the Supervisory Board committee[s. GRI 2-14](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Implementation of the GCGC**\n\nCorporate governance involves the responsible management and control of companies, geared towards long-term value creation. The corporate governance and corporate culture of Instone Real Estate Group SE comply with the legal requirements and – with a few reasonable exceptions – the additional recommendations of the GCGC. The Management Board and Supervisory Board feel very committed to good corporate governance and all divisions are guided by this objective. The Company focusses on values such as competence, transparency and sustainability.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board have carefully considered the fulfilment of the GCGC requirements. In doing so, they have taken into account the GCGC in the version dated 28 April 2022 and, in accordance with Section 161 AktG submitted their joint regular Declaration of Compliance with the recommendations of the GCGC in December 2023 and commented on the few exceptions.\n\nThe statement and any further declarations of compliance since the IPO [are published on the Company's website in the](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5910/entsprechenserklaerung.html) ä Instone Group Declaration of Compliance.\n\n#### **Declaration of Compliance**\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE (the \"Company\") are required pursuant to Section 161 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) to issue an annual declaration of compliance stating that the recommendations of the \"Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code\" published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official Section of the Federal Gazette have been, and are being, complied with or which recommendations have not been, or are not being, complied with and why not. The Management Board and Supervisory board last issued a Declaration of Compliance in December 2021.\n\nThe Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board declare that for the period since the last Declaration of Compliance was submitted in December 2022, they have complied with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the version last published in the official part of the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022 and dated 28 April 2022 (\"2022 GCGC\") and will also do so in future:\n\n- 1. According to recommendation B.3, the first appointment of members of the Management Board is for a maximum of three years. During the declaration period, the Supervisory Board filled the position of CFO, which had become vacant following the departure of Dr Madjlessi, with David Dreyfus for a term of appointment of four years and three months. The Supervisory Board has therefore deviated from recommendation B.3 in the interest of the Company because David Dreyfus emerged from the structured recruiting process as the clear favourite and first choice of the Supervisory Board and one of the conditions by which he was recruited for this position was on the basis of the agreed term of his appointment. In addition, the agreed term of appointment reflects a reasonably long-term, sustainable appointment pursued by the Supervisory Board, which at the same time also prevents the existing Management Board mandates all expiring within a short period of time.\n- 2. In accordance with recommendation G.7 of the GCGC 2022, the Supervisory Board must define the performance criteria for all variable remuneration components for each member of the Management Board for the forthcoming financial year, which, in addition to operational targets, should primarily be based on strategic objectives. The corporate planning and the forecast, from which the relevant performance criteria for the Management Board are derived by the Supervisory Board, are adopted at the beginning of the financial year due to the higher level of planning accuracy. Based on this, the\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-182-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nSupervisory Board also defines the performance criteria for the variable remuneration components at the beginning of the relevant financial year. From the Supervisory Board's point of view, this is appropriate to harmonise the corporate planning adopted with the performance criteria for the Management Board. This recommendation will therefore not be followed in the future.\n\n3. Under recommendation G.10 sentence 2 of the GCGC, a member of the Management Board should not actually receive variable long-term remuneration amounts for four years. The remuneration system for the Management Board and the contracts of employment for the members of the Management Board, however, state that long-term variable performance-related remuneration should be paid at the end of a threeyear performance period. This is in line with the requirements under stock corporation law for long-term assessment bases for variable remuneration as well as the recommendations of various institutional advisers. In the view of the Supervisory Board, however, a longer delay in the payment of the variable long-term remuneration has no added value for the incentive of the Management Board compared to the existing contractual provisions. This recommendation will therefore not be followed in the future.\n\nEssen, December 2023\n\nThe Management Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\n**Corporate governance practices**\n\nThe management of Instone Real Estate Group SE is largely determined by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and is also focussed on the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Management Board has laid set fundamental values of lawful and ethical conduct in a Group-wide Code of Conduct, which is also available on our website at ä http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/ [English/5800/verhaltenskodex.html. This specifies existing duties and](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5800/verhaltenskodex.html )  responsibilities at the Instone Group and derives various codes of conduct on the basis of the law or existing official instructions. The Code of Conduct provides guidance and assistance to Instone Group employees in their dayto-day work while at the same time defining binding requirements for the actions of all employees. Instone Real Estate Group SE is expressly committed to the values reflected in the Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board has defined overarching principles for the thoughts and actions of the Instone Group, which can also be viewed on our website at ä [www.instone-group.de/en. T](http://www.instone-group.de/en)hese include, for example, the positioning of the Instone Group on topics such as social responsibility, the environment, economic growth, the sustainability of our projects and external communications, as well as the handling of stakeholder groups relevant to our company, including customers, employees, partners and contract partners.\n\n### **Working methods of the Management Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Instone Real Estate Group SE is a European listed company (SE) with headquarters in Essen, Germany, which in accordance with its articles of association, has a dual management system consisting of the Management Board and Supervisory Board. These work together closely and trustingly for the benefit of the Company. The Management Board manages the Company whereas the Supervisory Board provides advice and supervision.\n\nBoth the Management Board and the Supervisory Board each have their own Rules of Procedure which include detailed regulations about the respective activities of the Boards and the internal organisation, as well as for the collaboration between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board which go beyond the provisions of stock corporation law[.

The Management Board also discusses the status of the strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board at regular intervals. The Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Audit Committee regularly liaise with the Management Board between meetings and discuss questions of strategy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management, compliance, the internal control system and aspects of sustainability with the Management Board. The Chair of the Supervisory Board is informed by the Management Board without delay about important events which are of material importance for the assessing the financial position and performance as well as for managing the Company and its Group companies. The Chair of the Supervisory Board then informs the Supervisory Board and convenes an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting if necessary. In addition, the Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly and as required by law, by the Articles of Association and by the Management Board's Rules of Procedure, which contain comprehensive provisions for the reports and information to be submitte[d. GRI 2-30,](#page-286-0) [3](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board also stipulate that fundamentally significant measures and legal transactions must be subject to approval by the Supervisory Board. The relevant rules of procedure of the Management Board and Supervisory Board also contain provisions for the handling conflicts of interest within the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, which, in addition to an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay, provide for the approval of the Supervisory Board in the event of material conflicts of interest within the Management Board and, in the event of conflicts of interest identified on the Supervisory Board, prevent the member concerned participating and/or voting. In the event of material and not merely temporary conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board member concerned must resign from office. No conflicts of interest were identified on the Management Board and Supervisory Board during the year under review.\n\nTransactions between members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and related parties with the Company or its affiliates also require the approval of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The assumption of ancillary activities outside the Company by the members of the Management Board – in particular, supervisory board mandates and mandates on comparable supervisory bodies of commercial enterprises – requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA D&O group insurance policy has been concluded for the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.

GRI 2-9](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Distribution of duties and rules of procedure\n\nThe Management Board performs the management function as a collegial body. Irrespective of the overall responsibility for the management, the individual members of the Management Board are responsible for the departments assigned to them in accordance with the legislation, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, and are personally responsible in the context of Management Board resolutions. The Management Board has not formed any committees. The work of the Management Board, including the allocation of responsibilities, is governed by the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, which were adopted by the Supervisory Board and last amended on 26 April 2022.\n\nThe organisational chart defined for the Management Board is shown on the following page. The Management Board's rules of procedure also set out the cases which require a resolution by the entire Management Board. Management Board meetings are held fortnightly when possible, but at least once a month, in face-to-face or virtual form, chaired by the Chair of the Management Board. The Rules of Procedure for the Management Board also allow resolutions to be passed outside of meetings. Resolutions are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast unless the law provides otherwise.\n\n#### Reservations of consent and rules of information\n\nIn addition to certain approval reservations contained in the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board has set out certain other transactions and measures of fundamental importance in the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board which require its prior approval. These include, for example, the adoption of the annual planning, larger land acquisitions and the conclusion and amendment of certain financing agreements, as well as the implementation of certain corporate law measures. Transactions between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and members of the Management Board or related parties also require the approval of the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and must comply with the usual market conditions.\n\nThe Management Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly and comprehensively as well as promptly, and when appropriate, and in accordance with the legislation, the Articles of Association and the principles of information defined in the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, in particular with regard to strategy and the course of business, as well as its prospective development and on fundamental matters relating to the Company, including on its assets, finance and earnings situation, the risk situation, risk management and risk controlling, compliance as well as ongoing projects and the Company's finance situation.

It works closely with the Management Board for the benefit of the Company and is involved in all decisions of fundamental importance.\n\nIts rights and duties are determined by the statutory provisions, the Articles of Association, the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board of 14 October 2021 and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board. It appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, represents the Company when dealing with them and, together with the Management Board, ensures long-term succession planning.\n\nThe work of the Supervisory Board takes place both in plenary sessions and in committees. The work of the committees aims to further increase the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work. The committee chairs regularly report to the Supervisory Board on the work of their respective committees. According to the articles of association, the Supervisory Board must hold at least two meetings in six calendar months. In addition, it must hold meetings as often as and when the interests of the Company so require. The number and material content of the meetings and resolutions passed in writing by the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year are explained in more detail in the Supervisory Board's report from [page 24 on](#page-23-0)wards.\n\n#### Evaluation of committee work and advanced training of the members of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the efficiency of its activities at regular intervals, most recently in the 2023 financial year that has just ended, and subjected its committee work to a critical evaluation and assessment in a structured review process.\n\nThe Company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training and continual professional development.\n\n#### Skills profile and qualification\n\nThe Company has complied with the requirements of the composition of the Supervisory Board under corporate law and the individual recommendations in section C.1 of the GCGC relating to the determination of specific objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board under certain criteria, the consideration of these objectives in the Supervisory Board's proposals and the publication of these objectives and their implementation status in the corporate governance statement.\n\nTo this end, the Supervisory Board has adopted objectives for its composition, a skills profile and a diversity concept to ensure that the Supervisory Board provides qualified control and advice to the Management Board. It most recently reviewed this in December 2022 and, as part of this, expanded it to include \"sustainability\". The members of the Supervisory Board must have the following overall knowledge, skills and professional experience required for the proper performance of the duties of a Supervisory Board in a capital market-based real estate company:\n\n- → Experience in managing or supervising medium-sized or large companies or complex organisations\n- → Members as a whole must be familiar with the real estate sector and the project development industry\n- → In-depth knowledge about finance, accounting treatments, accounting, law and compliance in the General Committee as a whole\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- → At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have accounting expertise and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have auditing expertise (Section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)), whereby accounting and auditing also includes sustainability reporting\n- → Experience with capital market instruments and bank financing\n- → Expertise on sustainability issues in the real estate sector and the project development business which are important for the company\n\n| Foundations of the Group                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Sustainability report<br>Economic report |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Risk and<br>opportunities report         |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Outlook                                  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ► Other disclosures                      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ► Corporate governance<br>statement      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Consolidated financial<br>statements     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Independent<br>auditor's report          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Remuneration report                      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Other information                        |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Skills matrix for the Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE FIGURE 024**\n\nincluding sustainability reports and auditing of sustainability papers\n\n- Expertise\n- Special knowledge\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board should also have an appropriate number of independent members.\n\nThe status of the implementation of the skills profile is also shown for the individual members of the Supervisory Board in the above skills matrix and updated as appropriat[e.

The members of the Supervisory Board should also have sufficient time to carry out their mandate. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, this is the case for all members.\n\nOnly persons who have not yet reached the age of 70 at the time of appointment are to be proposed for election as a member of the Company's Supervisory Board. The standard limit for the period of membership of the Supervisory Board is twelve years. These requirements were also met; as of 31 December 2023, no member of the Supervisory Board had reached the age of 70 or exceeded the regulatory limit for membership of the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board had at its disposal three committees: the Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Further committees can be formed as required. The tasks and responsibilities and the personnel composition of the committees are set out below:\n\n#### Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible, in particular, for monitoring the accounting process, effectiveness of the internal control system and internal auditing system, the audit, in particular, the independence of the auditor, additional services provided by the auditor, the appointment of the auditor, granting the audit assignment to the auditor, the determination of audit priorities, the fee agreement, the assessment of the quality of the annual audit as well as compliance.\n\nThe audit committee prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board relating to the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. It is primarily responsible for the preliminary examination of the documents relating to the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, as well as the preparation of the statement or its approval and the profit appropriation proposal of the Management Board. Furthermore, the Audit Committee prepares the agreements with the auditor (in particular the appointment of the auditor), the determination of audit priorities and the fee agreement, as well as the engagement of the auditor by the Annual General Meeting. This also includes auditing the necessary independence, whereby the Audit Committee takes appropriate measures to ascertain and monitor the independence of the auditor. Instead of the Supervisory Board full meeting, the Audit Committee decides on agreements with the auditor (particularly issuing the audit mandate, determining the main audit areas and the fee agreement).

Diversity is therefore an important element for Instone Real Estate Group SE for sustainable corporate success.\n\nGiven this, the Supervisory Board determined in 2018 and confirmed once again in the 2020 financial year that attention will continue to be paid to diversity with regard to the composition of the Management Board in the future. The Supervisory Board has also set a target for the proportion of women on the Management Board and a standard retirement age for Management Board members at the age of 65. In the interests of complementary cooperation within the Supervisory Board, the selection of candidates for the Supervisory Board should also be based on sufficient diversity with regard to different professional backgrounds, specialist knowledge and experience.\n\nAccording to the self-assessment of the Supervisory Board, the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board as at 31 December 2023 complies with the described diversity concepts. The members of the Management Board have a range of different professional qualifications and, among other things, many years of experience in international corporations, investment banks and consultancies. David Dreyfus, the successor to Dr Foruhar Madjlessi, another member with many years of international experience and specialist expertise in capital markets and corporate finance has been a member of the Management Board since 1 September 2023. Furthermore, none of the members of the Management Board has reached the age of 65. As at 31 December 2023, the Supervisory Board continues to have a diverse membership and the target figure increased by the Supervisory Board for the proportion of women raised by from 20% to at least one third of the members in December 2023 has been or will be met.\n\n#### **Target figures for the proportion of women**\n\nThe German Stock Corporation Act obliges Instone Real Estate Group SE to set targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, the Management Board and in the first two levels of management below the Management Board.\n\n#### Supervisory Board target\n\nIn December 2020, the Supervisory Board defined a target figure for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, which at the time was set at 20%. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board in the past financial year has been 20%, thus meeting the target, until the committee was expanded to include another person as from 3 July 2023.\n\nAs a result of the expansion of the Supervisory Board by another member, which was made in accordance with the Supervisory Board's election proposal, the proportion of female members – as intended by the Supervisory Board – now amounts to one third. Against this background, as announced, the Supervisory Board has also raised the target figure for female members of the Supervisory Board to at least one third and this target has already been met due to the appointment of Ms Georgi.\n\n#### Target size for the Management Board\n\nFor the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE, the target for the proportion of women set by the Supervisory Board is currently still 0%. This is not least due to the fact that the Supervisory Board, having taken into account the current circumstances, in other words in particular the current term of office of Kruno Crepulja and Andreas Gräf until the end of 2025 and the size of the Management Board, which only has three members, did not consider an early review and, if necessary, setting a higher quota, in other words before the end of the five-year period at the end of 2025 for a new review, to be expedient. Regardless of this, as far as filling the position of CFO, which became vacant in the last financial year, is concerned, the issue of diversity with regard to female candidates has also been taken into account in the requirements profile due to its importance, but ultimately it did not prove possible to fill the position with a female candidate. The Supervisory Board's actual composition has taken account of the overriding principle of filling a position primarily based on qualification and competence, irrespective of gender.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remains firmly convinced that diversity is a key component of a successful Management Board team. Therefore, within the scope of its personnel competence, the Supervisory Board ensures—most recently in the context of filling the position of CFO at the beginning of the last financial year—that diversity is taken into account in the composition of the Management Board. The Company has met the target during the period under review.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe target last confirmed in December 2020 for the Management Board is valid for five years until December 2025 according to the guidelines issued by the Supervisory Board The target for female members of the Supervisory Board increased in the past financial year to at least one third of the members and this will also apply for five years, in other words until December 2028. At the latest when these periods have elapsed, the Supervisory Board will review the targets again.\n\n#### Target for first level of management\n\nFor the proportion of women at the first level of management below the Management Board, which consists of the members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, the Management Board decided in December 2020 to raise the target figure to 25% (without taking into account double mandates), after the target was previously 0%. As of 31 December 2023, the proportion of women at the first level of management was 20%, which means that the target figure was not reached in the past financial year. Nevertheless, the Instone Group continues to attach great importance to achieving this target.\n\n#### Target for second level of management\n\nIn December 2020, the Management Board decided to set the target at 30% for the proportion of women at the second level of management below the Management Board, which consists of branch managers, commercial managers, division managers and department heads. The proportion of women at the second level of management remained unchanged at 28% as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: 28%), which means that the target has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the Instone Group is continuing to make progress in meeting this target.\n\nThe Management Board has set implementation deadlines of five years, ending in December 2025, for the achievement of the targets at the first and second management levels.\n\n#### Management development\n\nThe Management Board promotes the achievement of goals through longterm staff planning and development. This includes, for example, the targeted support of female employees through training and professional development courses as well as the working time models offered by the Instone Group to promote equal opportunities in order to increase the number of women in management positions. In line with the practice adopted since the IPO, the Management Board has also determined, in\n\naccordance with Section A.2 of the GCGC, that diversity should also be respected and promoted for management appointments within the Company. The Management Board believes that diversity includes, but is not limited to, age, gender, international background, education and professional experience. Notwithstanding, the appointment and promotion of senior management positions in the Company and the underlying selection decisions will continue to be substantially based on specific qualifications. The Management Board will therefore continue to select managers based on their professional ability and aptitude for the specific roles in this management role, regardless of their background, gender or other non-performance characteristics.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on the appointment and succession planning at levels of management below the Management Board.\n\n#### Succession planning in the Management Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nTogether with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board ensures longterm succession planning for appointments to the Management Board. The long-term succession planning of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based on the corporate strategy, and takes into account the duration of the employment contracts of members of the Management Board and the standard age limit of 65 years laid down by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board has decided to negotiate an extension before the expiry of an employment contract, in principle together with the Management Board, and/or, if necessary, to initiate their succession by another suitable candidate. The Supervisory Board shall draft a job profile for vacant positions on the Management Board or for external candidates for positions to be filled, taking into account the diversity concept of the Company. In doing so, the Supervisory Board shall ensure that the knowledge, skills and experience of the candidates are in line with the requirements of the position to be filled and that they are balanced across the Management Board as a whole.\n\nSuccession planning in the Supervisory Board is the responsibility of the Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board, which identifies suitable candidates in the event of any existing or prospective vacancy on the Supervisory Board taking into account the competence and diversity profile of the Supervisory Board and recommends them to the Supervisory Board as an election proposal for the Annual General Meeting.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n- **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n- **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Compensation Systems and Remuneration Report**\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2023 financial year including the auditor's note under Section 162 AktG, the existing remuneration system under Section 87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG and the last remuneration resolution under Section 113 AktG for the members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are publicly accessible on the Instone Group website at ä [http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html.](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html)   [GRI 2-19, 2-20](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Annual General Meeting and shareholders**\n\nThe shareholders of Instone Real Estate Group SE assert their rights at the Annual General Meeting and exercise their voting rights. Each share in the Company grants one vote.\n\nAs a rule, the Annual General Meeting takes place annually within the first six months of the financial year. The agenda for the Annual General Meeting and the reports and documents required for the Annual General Meeting are published on the Company's website at ä [Instone General Meeting.](http://ir.en.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/6000/annual-general-meeting.html)\n\nFundamental decisions are made at the Annual General Meeting. These include resolutions on the appropriation of any profits, the discharge of the Management Board and Supervisory Boards, the election of Supervisory Board members and the selection of the auditor, amendments to the Articles of Association as well as capital measures. The Annual General Meeting offers the Management Board and the Supervisory Board the opportunity to liaise directly with the shareholders and discuss the further development of the Company.\n\nInstone Real Estate Group SE provides its shareholders with a proxy who is bound to follow shareholders' instructions and who can also be contacted during the Annual General Meeting in order to allow shareholders to personally exercise their rights. The invitation to the Annual General Meeting explains how instructions can be issued prior to the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders also remain free to be represented at the Annual General Meeting by a proxy of their choice.\n\n#### **2023 Annual General Meeting**\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting of Instone Real Estate Group SE took place in Essen on 14 June 2023 and was held as a general meeting with the shareholders physically present.

Those present accounted for 90.3% of the registered share capital (90.42% of the registered capital taking postal votes into account). All agenda items were agreed with a large majority.\n\n#### **Compliance**\n\nCompliance is a significant part of successful and responsible corporate governance at the Instone Group.\n\nWe are committed to ethical principles and valid legal norms.

The Code of Conduct is applicable throughout the Group and was introduced in all affiliated companies where we have direct or indirect controlling influence. A controlling influence is normally assumed if there is a participation in more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\nWe also expect our partners, such as customers, suppliers and other contract partners, to comply with certain standards, particularly including compliance with legal requirements and regulations that we have set out in our Code of Conduct for contractual partners, available on our website at ä [https://instone.de/en/become-a-partner/.](https://instone.de/en/become-a-partner/)\n\nOur central compliance organisation sees itself as a key contributor to an integrity-led corporate governance and culture.

We have therefore implemented a compliance management system that identifies and reduces risks, and ensures compliance within the Instone Group. To achieve this, we make use of various internal company policies and processes, such as money laundering prevention and business partner compliance, capital market compliance and corruption prevention, as well as training and advising our employees. Other important pillars of our compliance management system are our whistleblower system and our Code of Conduct for our contract partners.\n\nOur Group Compliance Officer is responsible for the Group-wide drafting, development and implementation of the compliance management system and for conducting the training courses. The Compliance Officer is available to employees as contact persons for compliance issues. The effectiveness and appropriateness of the compliance system are reviewed at regular meetings of the compliance committee, and any follow-up needs are identified and carried out. Within the scope of the ongoing development of the compliance management system, and when dealing with legal issues, the Management Board and compliance officer at the Group level can be given legal advice if required.\n\nWe regularly conduct compliance and data protection training that provides our employees with information about laws and codes of conduct. Attendance at the training events is mandatory for all Instone Group and is reviewed and documented. In the year under review, the rate of successful completion of training sessions was over 99%. In the year under review, the topics related primarily to anti-corruption, data protection, data security and competition and cartel law. There is a compliance Section on the Instone Group Intranet site so that employees have direct, compact access to any material compliance information (including contact details for compliance, links and guidelines). Information on all current compliance topics is posted her[e. GRI 205-2,](#page-287-0) [410, 410-1](#page-288-0)\n\n#### Whistleblower system\n\nDespite having the best, wide-ranging prevention measures, illegal acts and breaches of duty may still occur. Employees, customers, contract partners and other third parties may report violations or suspected violations of laws and internal guidelines and regulations by email and via a digital whistleblower portal specially set up for this purpose, via which reports can be passed on anonymously to the Instone Group at the request of the whistleblower. Our employees can also contact their line managers and the Compliance Officer directly at any time with informatio[n. GRI 2-16](#page-286-0)\n\nWe check all reports and follow them up consistently. In doing so, we observe the following principles:\n\n- → The process is fair,\n- → Anonymity is protected,\n- → Investigations are confidential and\n- → Processes are efficient and protected.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there was no evidence of compliance breaches at the Instone Group that have proven to be accurate. Nevertheless, Instone Group will carefully investigate and respond to suspected cases of compliance breaches.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Money Laundering Prevention and Business Partner Compliance\n\n### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n- [Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n- [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n- Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n- [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n- **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n- **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe careful selection of business partners, in particular to reduce corruption and fraud risks as well as to prevent money laundering is an essential component of compliance at the Instone Group. The Instone Group has therefore implemented special preventive measures, which are routinely or occasionally carried out in order to detect and counteract such suspicions, including:\n\n- → Due diligence of business partners for compliance risks,\n- → Due diligence around suspected money laundering,\n- → Checking of potential business partners against sanctions lists and\n- → Verification of bank details and payment transactions for contract partners.\n\nPrior to the conclusion of any contract (for example with contractors or buyers of our properties), a business partner audit (third party due diligence) must be carried out by the Instone Group on a regular basis. Employees of the Instone Group are obliged to first identify each potential business partner carefully. This is primarily due to those employees who conclude contracts with business partners, such as Purchasing and Project or Sales Management. If an increased compliance risk or money laundering risk is identified as part of this, the Compliance Officer must become involved.\n\nThe Instone Group and its employees also comply with the requirements of the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) in order to protect the company from damage (in particular with regard to reputation and standing). In the case of real estate transactions, the certifying notaries are also obliged to carry out an identity check and contribute to preventing money laundering as part of said real estate transactions. If a suspected money laundering risk is identified during the business partner check, the business partner is reviewed more closely. If the suspicion of a money laundering risk is confirmed, the Compliance Officer decides on the further course of action and making a report to the relevant state authorities.\n\nThe Instone Group complies with its legal obligations to check new customers, suppliers and service providers for their inclusion on sanctions lists. For example, existing customers and suppliers with whom a long-term relationship exists are regularly checked.\n\nTo prevent fraud, our employees are also obliged to check and release bank details, transfers and payments received by a company directive in compliance with the principle of dual control.\n\n#### Code of Conduct for contractual partners\n\nWe also demand compliance with our high standards from our business partners and suppliers. As mentioned above, in our Code of Conduct for contractual partners, they commit to refraining from any kind of corruption or acts that could be construed as such. We also expect and work to ensure that our business partners and suppliers respect these obligations, principles and values, and take all of the measures necessary to prevent and punish active and passive corruption.\n\n#### Capital Market Compliance\n\nAs a listed company and listed in the Prime Standard, the Instone Group is subject to a number of capital market regulations, which are based in particular on the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation), the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) and the Stock Exchange Ordinance for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The Instone Group encourages its board members and employees to comply with these obligations by establishing rules of conduct that relate in particular to the following obligations:\n\n- → Ban on insider trading and the illegal disclosure of inside information\n- → Obligation for ad hoc publication\n- → Ban on market manipulation\n- → Reporting of business transactions carried out by management staff on their own behalf\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group has also set up an ad hoc committee to advise the Management Board on specific occasions and to recommend action for dealing with possible insider information. Employees are obliged to report possible insider information to the ad hoc committee without delay and, if they become aware of insider information, are added to insider lists in accordance with legal obligations. Trading in Instone Group shares with knowledge of inside information is banned. Employees are also urged not to conduct any direct or indirect business with Instone Group shares during socalled closed periods within 30 days prior to the publication of the halfyear or annual financial statements. They are notified of the start and end of these closed periods by a traffic light system on the Instone Group Intranet.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE as well as other personnel performing management tasks at Instone Real Estate Group SE, and persons closely related to them are required under Article 19(1) of the Market Abuse Regulation to report transactions in shares of Instone Real Estate Group SE or related financial instruments to the Company without delay and no later than three business days after the date of the transaction. The Company publishes the notifications pursuant to Article 19 (2) of the Market Abuse Regulation without delay and no later than three business days after the transaction.

financial statements**\n\n#### General information about the Company\n\nAs of 28 August 2018, Instone Real Estate Group SE (hereinafter referred to as the \"Company\") is domiciled in Essen, Germany, and its head office is located at Grugaplatz 2–4, 45131 Essen, Germany. It is the ultimate parent company of Instone Real Estate Group SE (hereinafter also referred to as \"Instone Group\"). The Company is registered under the record number HRB 32658 in the Commercial Register of the Local Court of Essen.\n\nThe Company holds interests in subsidiaries whose principal activities are the acquisition, development, construction, leasing, management and sale or other use of land and buildings, as well as holding interests in other companies active in the sector.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and the combined management report were approved by the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE on 8 March 2024.\n\n#### Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  [GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group as of 31 December 2023 were prepared on the reporting date on the basis of Section 315e(1) HGB in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the related Interpretations (IFRIC) of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as they apply in accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of international accounting standards in the European Union.\n\nVarious items of the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement are combined into one item for a better overview. These items are shown and explained separately in the Notes. The consolidated income statement is prepared according to the nature of expense method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros, which is the functional currency and the reporting currency of the Group. All amounts are expressed in thousands of euros (€ thousand) unless stated otherwise. Commercial rounding may lead to immaterial rounding differences in the totals.\n\nIn the course of reporting on our corporate responsibility activities, we are guided by recognised standards and reporting initiatives, including the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In order to clearly illustrate the contribution made by our products, services and activities to the respective sustainability goal and our value chain, we have marked the corresponding text passages with the respective GRI and TCFD symbol (illustrative exampl[e: GRI](#page-286-0), [TCFD](#page-289-0)). The references contain information that is not included in the notes, which is excluded from the content review by the auditor.\n\nThe subsidiary financial statements included were prepared on the reporting date of the financial statements of Instone Real Estate Group SE.\n\n#### Accounting standards to be applied for the first time in the current financial year [GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nIn recent years, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has made various changes to existing IFRS and published new IFRS as well as Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC). The aim is to clarify inconsistencies and formulations. The following standards that were to be applied from financial years beginning on or after 31 December 2023 had no impact on these consolidated financial statements, except for any additional disclosures in the Notes:\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Our company                                         | → IFRS 17       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| To our shareholders                                 | → Amendments t  |\n| Combined<br>management report                       | → Amendments t  |\n| ► Consolidated financial<br>statements              | → Annual Improv |\n| Consolidated income<br>statement                    |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of comprehensive income   |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of financial position     |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of cash flows             |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of changes in equity      |                 |\n| ► Notes to the consolidated<br>financial statements | → Amendments t  |\n| Independent<br>auditor's report                     |                 |\n| Remuneration report                                 | → Amendments t  |\n| Other information                                   |                 |\n\n| → | Amendments to IAS 1                                                                   |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| → | Amendments to IAS 8                                                                   |\n| → | Amendments to IAS 12                                                                  |\n| → | Annual Improvements to IFRSs, 2018–2020 cycle                                         |\n|   | Accounting standards and interpretations already published<br>but not yet implemented |\n|   | In addition to the above-mentioned mandatory IFRSs, the IASB ha                       |\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned mandatory IFRSs, the IASB has published further amended IASs and IFRSs, but these only need to be applied at a later date. Several of these standards have already been transposed into EU law (\"endorsement\"). Voluntary early application of these standards is expressly permitted or recommended. The Instone Group does not make use of this option. These standards will be implemented in the consolidated financial statements of the time of mandatory adoption.\n\n### Already incorporated into EU law (first-time adoption date in\n\n- → Amendments to IFRS 16 (1 January 2024)\n- → Amendments to IAS 1 (1 January 2024)\n\n### Not yet incorporated into EU law (first-time adoption date in\n\n- → Amendments to IAS 7 (1 January 2024)\n- → Amendments to IAS 21 (1 January 2025)\n\nWith the exception of new or modified notes, the new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Scope of consolidatio[n GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nThe equity investments of Instone Real Estate Group SE include subsidiaries, joint ventures and financial interests.\n\nIn addition to Instone Real Estate Group SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group include all subsidiaries controlled by Instone Real Estate Group SE according to the acquisition method. A control relationship exists if the Instone Group as an investor has the continuing opportunity to determine the relevant activities of the subsidiary. Significant activities are activities that significantly affect returns. Furthermore, Instone Real Estate Group SE must have an interest in the form of fluctuating returns and be able to influence them with the options and rights available to the Company for its own benefit. As a rule, a controlling relationship exists if the majority of the voting rights are held directly or indirectly. In group companies, a controlling relationship can also arise through contractual agreements.\n\nShares in joint ventures and associated companies are recognised using the equity method. A joint venture is established if the Instone Group jointly conducts activities together with third parties on the basis of a contractual obligation. Decisions on relevant activities are taken unanimously between the partners. The partners have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. An associated company exists if the Instone Group can exert significant influence without being able to control that company.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, a total of 13 (previous year: 17) domestic and two (previous year: two) European foreign subsidiaries, in addition to Instone Real Estate Group SE, have been included and fully consolidated in the current consolidated financial statements. In the 2023 financial year, three companies were eliminated from the scope of consolidation due to mergers.\n\nDue to a loss of control, Projekt Am Sonnenberg Wiesbaden GmbH was deconsolidated in the reporting year. The shares of the joint venture are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The profit of €2,815 thousand resulting from the initial valuation of the atequity investment is recognised as other operating income. This deconsolidation has meant that a short-term loan receivable in the amount of €19,833 thousand is reported. At the same time, the accounting recognition of the project and the corresponding project financial liability is no longer required in the year under review due to the loss of control.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nOn 31 December 2023, ten joint ventures (previous year: eight) were valued using the equity method. In the previous year, an associated company was valued using the equity method. The measurement using the equity method was based on the latest available annual financial statements.\n\nIn total, six subsidiaries (previous year: six) had a low business volume or no business operation and were not consolidated on grounds of materiality. They are recognised at acquisition cost under other investments.\n\nDue to their overall minor importance, six companies (previous year: five) were not included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. These companies are of minor importance both individually and as a whole for the presentation of the results of operations, net assets and financial position of the Instone Group.\n\nA detailed overview of all shares directly or indirectly held by Instone Real Estate Group SE is provided in the list of shareholdings[. page](#page-252-0) 253 et seq..\n\n#### Business combination[s GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nBusiness combinations are recognised at acquisition cost as soon as control is transferred to the Instone Group.\n\nThe consideration paid for the acquisition is measured at fair value. The same applies to the acquired identifiable net assets and debts. The resulting goodwill is subjected to an impairment test annually. All profits from acquisitions at prices below the market value are posted directly to income. Transaction costs are recognised when they arise, except when issuing bonds or equity securities.\n\nThe consideration paid does not include the amounts required to settle past relationship receivables. These amounts are always recognised in the income statement. Contingent considerations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. If an obligation to make a contingent consideration that meets the requirements of the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity and it will not be revalued and recognised in equity. In other respects, a contingent consideration is valued at the fair value as of the respective reporting date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### Acquisition of non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured on the basis of their share, which at the time of acquisition is equal to the identifiable net assets of the acquirer. Changes in the Instone Group's investments in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.\n\n#### Principles of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared using standardised accounting principles. Intercompany balances, business transactions, income and expenses as well as profits and losses from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Deferred tax is deferred for temporary differences from consolidation measures. Consolidation adjustments are performed on impairment losses recorded for Group companies in their separate financial statements.\n\nThe same consolidation principles apply to shares in equity-accounted investees. These include the joint ventures of the Instone Group.\n\nThe financial statements of all equity-accounted affiliated companies are prepared in accordance with standardised Group accounting principles.\n\n#### Foreign currency translation\n\nAll fully consolidated companies and equity-accounted affiliated companies prepare their separate financial statements in accordance with standardised Group accounting principles.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n#### [Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Accounting principles\n\nAssets and liabilities are recognised according to the historical cost principle. This excludes derivative financial instruments, securities and shares in associates which are recognised at fair value.\n\n**Goodwill** from the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised at cost and is not subject to scheduled depreciation, but is instead subject to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 once a year and, in addition, a further test if there exist indicators that point to a potential impairment. The goodwill accounted for in the Bavaria North branch as a cashgenerating unit, is classified as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as it has neither a product life cycle nor is it subject to technical, technological or commercial wear or other restrictions.\n\nThe annual impairment test of goodwill is carried out at the Instone Group on 31 December of the financial year. As part of the impairment tests, the recoverable amount of a branch is compared with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of the individual value in use of the allocated project developments. This corresponds to the present value of future cash flows that are expected to be achieved from the group of cash-generating units. The value in use is calculated on the basis of a project valuation model (discounted cash flow method). The determination is based on project-based cash flow plans for the next four years, which are generally based on the project planning approved by the Management Board and valid at the time the impairment test is carried out for the development period. There was no assumption of cash flows beyond the planning period of the projects. Experience and expectations regarding future market development are included in this planning. The cost of capital rates are based on the concept of weighted average cost of capital (WACC). A post-tax calculation of the value in use is carried out by discounting the cash flows at a cost of capital rate calculated separately for each cash-generating unit after tax. A perpetuity with a growth rate of 2.0% has been assumed.\n\nPurchased **intangible assets** are measured at amortised cost. These include software for commercial and technical applications only. Intangible assets are generally amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years. Internally generated intangible assets include in-house software and are measured at production cost less scheduled depreciation and amortisation over a useful life of three years. The useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed every year.\n\n**Property, plant and equipment** are recognised at amortised costs. These costs only include costs that are directly attributable to an item in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of three to eight years. The useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed every year.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised for tangible and intangible assets if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. If the reason for an earlier loss in value no longer exists, the asset is reversed at amortised cost.\n\n**Leases** are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 16. At the time of provision of the leased property, the right of use is recognised as an asset and the associated payment obligation is recognised as a leasing liability in the statement of financial position. The right of use is amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the economic useful life of the leased asset. Payment obligations are discounted using the appropriate marginal cost of capital rate. Discounting is generally calculated using term and currency-specific marginal borrowing cost of capital rates, unless the interest rate underlying the lease payments is available. Each lease payment is divided into repayments and interest expenses. Interest expenses are recognised in profit or loss over the term of the lease.\n\nThis accounting does not include short-term leases with a term of no longer than twelve months and leases where the asset underlying the lease agreement is of low value The value limit is €5 thousand. Such agreements are recognised in profit or loss at the time of payment. In addition, rights of use of intangible assets are excluded from the scope of application. These are separated in contracts that include lease components and non-lease components, except in the case of insignificant asset classes.\n\nThe Instone Group also generates a small amount of income from leases through the acquisition of leased existing real estate that is intended for demolition or redevelopment. No specific long-term income is expected from these leases, as the aim of the Instone Group is to terminate the leases.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n#### [Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Shares accounted for using the equity method** are valued at acquisition cost and are recognised pro rata to the net assets in subsequent periods. The full carrying amount is tested annually for impairment; withdrawals and other changes in equity increase or reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Interests accounted for using the equity method are then impaired if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount.\n\n**Other investments** include investments and securities that fall exclusively in the valuation category \"Fair value through profit and loss\". They are measured at fair value.\n\n**Other financial assets** include financial receivables, trade receivables and other receivables and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (taking into account factors such as surcharges and rebates). Non-interest-bearing or low-interest loans are initially recognised at their discounted amount using a current market interest rate and subsequently carried forward using the effective interest method. Impairment losses are recognised if there is an expected loss on the basis of the credit risk. The Instone Group uses the simplified value reduction model of IFRS 9 on all trade receivables and contract assets and therefore recognises the expected losses over the total term.\n\n**Deferred tax liabilities** arise due to temporary differences between the IFRS and tax statements of financial position of the various companies and as a result of the consolidation.\n\n**Deferred tax assets** are also recognised for tax refund claims arising from the anticipated utilisation of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years. Deferred tax liabilities must be capitalised if it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that the affiliated economic benefits can be claimed. Their amount is calculated on the basis of the tax rates which apply or are expected to apply at the time of adoption in the different countries. The German trade tax rates applicable to the various companies are taken as a basis within the Group. For all other purposes, deferred tax liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the time of reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other for each company or group of companies.\n\n**Inventories** are assets that are in production (work-in-progress) and for which no sales contract has yet been concluded. They are measured at acquisition and production cost. Acquisition and production cost includes the complete production-related costs. Borrowing costs for inventories that are part of the qualifying assets are capitalised as cost components. If the recoverable amount is lower than the capitalised costs on a specific reporting date, the lower recoverable amount is used. If the net realisable value of inventories increases as a result, the resulting gain must be recognised. This is done by increasing the changes in inventories. For the purpose of commercial presentation, the inventories from the individual larger project development measures are split into several sub-project development measures. This split has no impact on the measurement. Within the Group, the respective overall project is recognised as a special measure in the current assets. The risks arising from individual sub-project units can be compensated by opportunities from other sub-projects. An impairment requirement beyond the carrying amount is taken into account by recognising a provision for contingent losses.\n\nPlanning costs included in acquisition and production cost are recognised directly as an expense in the event of significant rescheduling that constitutes a planning error.\n\nReceivables and payables from individually negotiated customer contracts are presented under **contract assets** and **contract liabilities**. These receivables and liabilities are accounted for and measured in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\".\n\nThe Company's customer contracts meet the criteria for identifying a contract under IFRS 15. For measurement purposes, the respective potentially separable performance obligations in the respective contracts are combined into one performance obligation as there is no individual benefit for the customer from separate performance obligations and the contracts do not provide for the transfer of separate benefit obligations. Subsequently agreed special requests of the customer are also added to the single performance obligation.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe contracts are generally regarded as fixed price contracts. Subsequent special requests are added to the fixed price. If the sale of several residential units in a contract is combined in multi-level marketing, a separate fixed price is agreed in the contract for each residential unit. In the case of investor distribution, contracts are always concluded with fixed prices listed separately if the performance obligation of the contract involves several buildings with separate construction phases. In addition to the generally agreed fixed price, the contracts involving investor distribution contain, in some cases, an adjustment clause at a fixed price on the basis of the constructed living space after final completion. In other cases, the purchase price for an investor contract can be based on the construction cost index. The contracts for the sale of residential real estate are generally valued according to revenue recognition over time. In the case of contracts in individual sales, there is usually a bilateral right of withdrawal up to a marketing quota of 30% of the residential units of a construction phase so that revenue recognition over a period of time only begins after this quota has been reached. Otherwise, in the case of contracts in the area of structured sales or investor distribution, the revenue recognition over time begins directly upon effectiveness of the contract. The agreed fixed price is generally accepted as a basis for the expected revenues for all contracts, as the adjustment to the constructed living space is not clearly identifiable before completion in the case of investor contracts. Performance progress is determined according to the input-oriented cost-to-cost method on the basis of the performance status of the compliance costs. For the calculation of the costs, a separate project account is kept for each phase of construction in which the costs are recorded and compared with the planned costs. In the case of contracts in individual sales and structure sales, the marketing quota of the construction section is included in the measurement in addition to the performance progress. The unsold portion of the construction stage is valued as inventories in accordance with IAS 2.\n\nContracts with individual and structured sales are generally concluded with an instalment payment plan in accordance with the Broker and Developer Regulations (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung; MaBV). As a rule, for contracts involving investor distribution, instalment payment plans are also agreed based on the MaBV regulations.\n\nIn contract assets and contract liabilities, the advance payments received from customers against the contracts concluded are netted with the receivables from the performance of the contract. As a general rule, the settlement receivables exceed the advance payments received for the contract and the net value is recognised as a contract asset. In individual cases, advance payments received may exceed the settlement receivables so that the netted value is shown as a contract liability.\n\nThe additional contract costs incurred are also capitalised in the \"Contract assets\" item in the statement of financial position. From the beginning of revenue recognition, the sales commissions incurred and capitalised so far are amortised in the income statement under cost of materials. Depreciation is measured at the fulfilment level so that contract costs remain capitalised on the part not yet fulfilled.\n\nReceivables and liabilities arising from customer contracts are realised in one single business cycle of the Instone Group. Consequently, they are classified as current assets or liabilities, even if the realisation of the entire construction contract takes more than one year.\n\nAs a general rule, the contracts with customers of Instone Group do not provide for redemption obligations and guarantees beyond the statutory framework. In individual cases, contracts with corresponding rights of withdrawal are concluded.\n\n**Government grants** are recognised at fair value at the time when there is sufficient certainty that the conditions associated with the grant will be met and that the grant will be received. In the statement of financial position, receivables from these grants are shown under Other receivables. The grants are presented as current assets because the receipt and use of the grants are linked to the contract assets and inventories, which are also presented as current. Liabilities from government grants are presented under Other liabilities. Grants for units already sold are collected in accordance with the progress of construction and recognised in the income statement in the periods in which the corresponding expenses, which are to be compensated by the government grant, are recognised as expenses. Income grants from KfW funding programmes are recognised in the Instone Group as government grants. They are presented in the income statement under Other operating income.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nLoans that include government grants in the form of partial debt relief and discounted interest rates are carried as financial liabilities at fair value and subsequently carried forward at amortised cost. At the time of disbursement of a loan that includes government grants, the amount of funding from the loan is reclassified to Other liabilities and collected in accordance with the progress of construction of the sold units.\n\nIf it is not probable that the requirements associated with the grant will be met, the balance sheet items associated with the grants will be reversed and recognised in profit or loss.\n\n**Liquid funds** (cash and cash equivalents) exist in the form of bank balances. In the previous year, they also existed in the form of cash on hand. They also include all capital investments with a residual maturity at the acquisition date of up to three months. Cash and cash equivalents are valued at their nominal value.\n\n**Treasury shares** are deducted from equity at the value of the consideration paid, including directly attributable incidental costs. If these units are issued again, the difference between the acquisition cost and the issue price is posted to the capital reserve in the event of increased proceeds and deducted from the revenue reserves in the event of reduced proceeds. Acquisition cost is determined using the average cost method as the consumption tracking method.\n\n**Provisions** are made for all legal and constructive liabilities to third parties existing on the closing date from transactions concluded in the past that are likely to result in the disposal of resources which can be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions are recognised at their anticipated settlement value and are not offset against reimbursement claims. All non-current provisions are recognised at their anticipated settlement value and discounted to the reporting date of the annual financial statements. Furthermore, all cost increases that count towards the settlement date are taken into account when calculating this amount.\n\n**Provisions for pensions and similar obligations** are recognised for defined benefit plans. These include obligations of the Company with respect to current and future benefits to eligible active and former employees and their survivors. These obligations largely relate to pension benefits. The individual commitments are determined on the basis of the length of service and the salaries of the employees. The measurement of provisions for defined benefit plans is based on the actuarial value of the respective obligation. This is determined using the projected unit credit method. This projected unit credit method not only includes pensions and accrued benefits known as of the reporting date but also wage increases and pension increases expected in the future. The calculation is based on actuarial reports using biometric calculation methods (primarily the \"Richttafeln 2018 G\" (Mortality Tables) of Klaus Heubeck).\n\nThe provision is calculated on the basis of the actuarial present value of the obligation and the fair value of the plan assets required to settle the pension obligation. The service cost is included in staff costs. The net interest income is part of the finance income. Gains and losses from the revaluation of net liabilities or net assets are recognised in full in the period in which they arise. They are presented in equity, are not recognised in profit or loss and are not presented in the consolidated income statement. In subsequent years they are also not shown in the profits and losses.\n\nThe Instone Group makes no further commitments for defined contribution plans that would exceed the contributions paid to Special Funds. The contributions are recorded as staff costs.\n\nAll **other provisions** take into account all identifiable risks. They are recognised at the amount required on the basis of prudent business judgement to meet future payment obligations of the Instone Group. In this context, the amount that appears most likely is used, taking into account the individual case.\n\n**Share-based remuneration** is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2. These provisions cover the non-current share-based compensation programmes with cash settlement and the issue of employee shares. Liabilities from non-current share-based incentive plans are measured at their fair value and presented under personnel provisions.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Non-current loans** recognised in financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost. Interest-bearing loans at normal market rates are recognised at their face value.\n\nNon-derivative **financial liabilities** (including trade payables) are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method in accordance with IFRS 9. Initial measurement is at fair value including transaction costs.\n\n**Liabilities from net assets attributable to non-controlling interests** relate to the limited partner share of minority shareholders. Upon being acquired by the Instone Group, they are recognised in other comprehensive income as liabilities measured at the present value of the repayment amount. Subsequent measurement is through profit and loss.\n\n**Income tax liabilities** include obligations to pay current income tax. Income tax liabilities are offset against the corresponding tax refund claims if they exist in the same jurisdiction and are identical in terms of their type and due date.\n\n**Contingent liabilities** are potential obligations to third parties arising from events that have already taken place and that cannot be fully controlled by the Company, or existing obligations to third parties that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources or whose amount cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not generally shown in the statement of financial position.\n\n**Earnings per share** are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the shareholders of the Instone Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n#### Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of the Instone Group's accounting policies, as well as recognition and measurement. Estimates are based on past experience and other knowledge of the transactions to be posted. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates are particularly required for the measurement of inventories and contract assets, particularly the estimate of the total costs and the sales revenues, the allocation of purchase prices, the effectiveness of sales contracts, the granting of pending approvals, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets, the allocation of trade payables and contract liabilities, the recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-214-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Segment reporting**\n\nSegment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 is based on the management approach and thus corresponds to the management and reporting system that the Instone Group uses for its segments. The Instone Group operates in only one operating segment and one geographical segment. It generates its revenue and holds its assets mainly in Germany. In the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group generated revenue with one customer representing 14.42% (previous year: 16.38%) of the reported total revenue. This was equivalent to €74,170 thousand (previous year: €92,978 thousand). Due to the homogeneity of the services provided to this customer and the other customers, only one operating segment is presented, as in the previous years.\n\nHowever, the internal reporting for the single operating segment differs from the figures in IFRS accounting. In its internal reporting, the Instone Group focuses in particular on the development of housing projects. For this reason, the Instone Group conducts segment reporting for this one operating segment.\n\nInternal corporate governance for this segment is based in particular on the internal reporting system for the presentation of key developments relating to real estate business and financial business key performance indicators, supplemented by an examination of key project milestones and liquidity development.\n\nThe Instone Group manages its segment through the adjusted results of operations using key performance indicators of adjusted revenue, adjusted gross profit and adjusted earnings after interest and tax.\n\n#### **Adjusted revenue**\n\nThe performance of the operating segment is reported via adjusted revenue on the basis of revenue recognition at a point in time or over time according to IFRS. Adjusted revenue is calculated by adding the revenue recognition from share deals in the same way as from asset deals, without the effects from purchase price allocations.\n\n#### **Adjusted gross profit**\n\nThe adjusted gross profit is used to analyse the project-based company performance and is determined on the basis of the adjusted revenue less the cost of materials, changes in inventories, other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials, indirect distribution costs and capitalised interest, but excluding effects from purchase price allocations, share deals and non recurring effects.\n\n#### **Adjusted earnings after tax**\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax is calculated on the basis of adjusted gross profit less platform costs, consisting of staff costs, other operating income and expenses, depreciation and amortisation, investment and other income, financial result and income taxes, but is also adjusted for the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals, as well as any non-recurring effects, where applicable. Since the 2020 financial year, the results of joint ventures are included in adjusted earnings before interest and tax, as future earnings of project companies to be recorded under this item are to be allocated to operating earnings.\n\nThe effects of the adjusted results of operations are derived from the following:\n\n#### Share deal effects\n\nThe project companies Westville 2 GmbH, Westville 3 GmbH, Westville 4 GmbH and Westville 5 GmbH are conceived as asset management companies under German commercial law and constitute one major project in Frankfurt am Main. The Instone Group has already sold these project companies in the form of a share deal with the obligation to build a residential complex. In the adjusted results of operations, the overall \"Westville\" project is managed in the same way as the other projects in the Instone Group, with revenue recognition over time in accordance with IFRS 15. These companies are valued and included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 2. The effects from this different valuation are reflected in the revenue of €99,103 thousand (previous year: €49,562 thousand), project costs of €88,005 thousand (previous year: €50,640 thousand) and income taxes of €1,904 thousand (previous year: €185 thousand).\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Effects from purchase price allocations\n\nDue to the first-time consolidation of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH in 2014 and Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH in 2015 as well as the business activities of S&P Stadtbau GmbH in 2019, as of 31 December 2023 inventories and contract assets still included writeups of €11,495 thousand (previous year: €17,098thousand) from purchase price allocations. The ongoing amortisation of these purchase price allocations on the basis of the progressive implementation of the projects included in these initial consolidations is adjusted for internal reporting. The adjustment for the amortisation of purchase price allocations was attributable as follows: €2,593 thousand (previous year: €3,932 thousand) to revenue, €-3,010 thousand (previous year: €-10,328 thousand) to changes in inventories and reduced to €1,635 thousand (previous year: €-4,512 thousand) to income taxes. Based on current estimates, the Instone Group expects these effects to expire in 2025.\n\n#### Reclassifications and non-recurring effects\n\nIn the year under review, indirect sales expenses amounting to €2,399 thousand (previous year: €2,811 thousand) were allocated to project costs.\n\nIn the year under review, one-time expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories to €-17,695 thousand were recognised. As these are unusual in their amount and cannot be regarded as recurring, they have been adjusted as a special effect.\n\nIn addition, other operating expenses in the amount of €-3,802 thousand were adjusted as non-recurring expenses. In the financial year, other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials (income opposed by a directly attributable item in cost of materials) in the amount of €15,105 thousand (previous year: €10,176 thousand) was reclassified to project costs. The adjustment of the capitalised interest in the changes in inventories of €12,228 thousand (previous year: €3,231 thousand) burdened the project costs.\n\nIn the following table, the differences arising from the valuation of the individual data are carried over from the adjusted results of operations to the consolidated reporting:\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Reconciliation of adjusted results of operations in 2023 TABLE 051**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n**T**\n\n| To our

Goodwill is not depreciated on schedule, but is subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 once a year, and whenever certain indicators point to a potential impairment loss. Goodwill is fully non-tax-deductible.\n\nThe goodwill of fully consolidated companies, which was capitalised as part of the initial consolidation, has been allocated to the relevant branch as cash-generating units in order to carry out impairment tests.\n\nThe discount rates for the cash-generating unit Bavaria North, which are used as part of the impairment tests, are 8.38% after taxes (previous year: 8.85%) and before tax at 12.23% (previous year: 12.92%).\n\nA comparison of the recoverable amounts of the branch with their carrying amount resulted in a surplus and there is therefore no need for a devaluation for goodwill. A sensitivity analysis of key parameters also did not lead to any deviating results.\n\n#### 12 Intangible assets\n\nAs in the previous year, intangible assets are not subject to any limitations on disposal. They include €221 thousand (previous year: €877 thousand) capitalised development costs, the production of which was already completed as of the reporting date, and €11 thousand (previous year: €63 thousand) concessions and industrial property rights.\n\n| Intangible assets                          |       | TABLE 066 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| In thousands of euros                      |       |           |\n|                                            | 2023  | 2022      |\n| Acquisition costs as of 1 January          | 1,725 | 1,714     |\n| Additions                                  | 0     | 12        |\n| Acquisition costs as of 31 December        | 1,725 | 1,725     |\n| Accumulated depreciation as of 1 January   | 786   | 267       |\n| Additions                                  | 707   | 519       |\n| Accumulated depreciation as of 31 December | 1,493 | 786       |\n|                                            | 232   | 940       |\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### 13 Right of use assets\n\nThe right of use assets recognised relate to real estate, inheritable building rights to project development properties, construction site equipment, passenger cars and construction site containers.

inventories of €971,911 thousand (previous year: €847,523 can only be realised after more than twelve months.\n\nThe inventories were subject to impairments of €22,272 thousand (previous year: €12,216thousand) and writedowns of 1,900 thousand. (previous year: €1,770 thousand).\n\nIn the financial year, planning costs capitalised as acquisition and production costs were derecognised due to rescheduling in the amount of €17,695 thousand.\n\n#### 18 Financial receivables\n\nThe financial receivables are as follows:\n\n| Financial receivables                                          |            | TABLE 074  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| In thousands of euros                                          |            |            |\n|                                                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Non-current                                                    |            |            |\n| Loans to joint ventures/other investments                      | 10,256     | 18,978     |\n| Other loans                                                    | 40         | 15         |\n|                                                                | 10,296     | 18,993     |\n| Current                                                        |            |            |\n| Loans to joint ventures/other investments                      | 19,919     | 60         |\n| Other loans                                                    | 35         | 35         |\n| Financial receivables from<br>joint ventures/other investments | 2,871      | 105        |\n| Other financial receivables                                    | 484        | 463        |\n|                                                                | 23,309     | 663        |\n|                                                                | 33,604     | 19,656     |\n\nThe increase in current financial receivables mainly relates to short-term loans to joint ventures and results primarily from the deconsolidation of Projekt Am Sonnenberg Wiesbaden GmbH.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 19 Contract assets\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n| The structure of contract assets is composed as follows: |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                          |          |\n| Contract assets                                          | TABLE 07 |\n\n| In thousands of euros                  |            |            |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                        | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Contract assets                        | 603,248    | 847,923    |\n| Payments received                      | -430,136   | -519,638   |\n|                                        | 173,112    | 328,284    |\n| Capitalised costs to obtain a contract | 3,957      | 5,301      |\n|                                        | 177,069    | 333,585    |\n\nThe change in contract assets results firstly from the higher number of transfers of residential real estate in the year under report and, secondly, from the reduced volume of sales contracts.\n\nThe cycle of contract assets is – equivalent to the project term – an average of three years.\n\nThe amortisation of the costs to obtain a contract in the amount of €1,439 thousand (previous year: €2,013 thousand) offsets the fulfilment of the underlying contracts with customers.\n\n#### 20 Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables amounted to €6,467 thousand as of the reporting date (previous year: €2,778 thousand).

In addition, conversions of projects due to these changes were corrected according to the corresponding receivables. In addition, the decrease in the success-based income is also due to pledged public grants already being accepted.\n\nIt is expected that, other than receivables from government grants and deposits, upfront payments on land and deposits, no other receivables or other assets can be realised after more than twelve months.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n22 Income tax assets\n\nReceivables from domestic and foreign tax authorities during the ordinary course of business amounted to €4,302 thousand as of the reporting date (previous year: €710 thousand).\n\n#### 23 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| Cash and cash equivalents |            | TABLE 077  |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| In thousands of euros     |            |            |\n|                           | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Bank balances             | 383,605    | 255,584    |\n| Cash                      | 0          | 8          |\n|                           | 383,605    | 255,592    |\n| of which restricted       | 119,256    | 12,600     |\n\nThe restrictions on the disposal of cash and cash equivalents result from project financing not yet completed by banks.\n\n#### 24 Equity\n\nThe registered capital of the Company as of 31 December 2023 was €46,988 thousand(previous year: €46,988thousand) and is fully paid up.

The earnings after tax attributable to noncontrolling interests amounts to €-1,144 thousand (previous year: €-814 thousand).\n\n#### 25 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\nThe existing pension plans of the Instone Group consist of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the Company makes payments to a state or private pension scheme, either on a statutory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company is not legally obliged to make any further payments.\n\nUnder the defined benefit plans, the Company is required to pay the promised benefits to existing and former employees. A distinction is made between plans financed by provisions or by external financing.\n\nThe pension plan available at the Instone Group consists of a basic pension financed by the Group companies in the form of a modular defined contribution plan and an additional pension component linked to the economic success of the Company. In accordance with IAS 19, the corresponding commitments are recognised as liabilities from defined benefit plans[. GRI 201-3](#page-286-0)\n\nThe liabilities from defined benefit plans of the Instone Group are as follows:\n\n#### **Liabilities from defined benefit plans TABLE 079**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n|                                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Active employees, not dependent on remuneration | 4,569      | 3,816      |\n| Vested claims                                   | 3,906      | 3,636      |\n| Ongoing pensions                                | 1,905      | 1,267      |\n|                                                 | 10,380     | 8,720      |\n\nThe average remaining time in service of the eligible active employees was 11.98 years as of the reporting date (previous year: 13.23 years).\n\nThe pension obligations are financed by the purchase of units in mutual funds. The obligations financed by Helaba Pension Trust e.V. account for 85.7% (previous year: 93.2%) of the total insurance coverage; total coverage is 90.4% (previous year: 98.5%).

The main risks are due to general changes in interest rates and inflation rates. There are no unusual risks associated with the pension obligations.\n\nInterest rate risk: The (mathematical) contributions are converted into benefits within the scope of a defined contribution pension plan using a table of fixed interest rates that are not dependent on actual market interest rates. The Instone Group therefore bears the risk arising from the general capital market interest rates with regard to determining benefits. The pension obligations decreased significantly in the year under review due to the generally higher interest rates in the capital market. The comparatively strong effect results from the relatively long duration of the obligations.\n\nInflation risk: According to legislation, the benefits of occupational pensions in Germany must be adjusted to inflation trends every three years. The 2000+ pension plan obligations in Germany under occupational pension schemes increase by 1% each year and other occupational pension obligations are only minor; therefore, there is little inflation risk during the retirement phase with regard to non-current pension commitments.\n\nLongevity risk: As a retirement provision is granted for a lifetime, there is a risk that beneficiaries will live longer than originally anticipated, with the Instone Group bearing the corresponding risk. In general, this risk balances out across all beneficiaries and only has an impact if the overall lifetime is longer than originally thought.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the possible impact of the stated risks when changing the actuarial assumptions to the obligations under a defined benefit pension plan:\n\n| Sensitivity analysis                     |            |          |

A possible LTI bonus depends on the achievement of company-related financial targets and nonfinancial ESG targets and the share price performance, taking into account distributions during the performance period. The contractually agreed base amount – an individually determined base amount for each member of the Management Board on which the calculation is based – is based on the average volume-weighted Instone Group share price over the last three months before the start of the performance period. At the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board determines whether the targets have been achieved.

Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, headquartered in Essen, Germany and registered in the Commercial Register of the Essen District Court under HRB 30620, complies with the requirements set out in Section 264(3) HGB and is therefore exempt from the publication and auditing of annual financial statements and the preparation and auditing of a management report.\n\n#### Reporting on financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual rights and obligations relating to the exchange and transfer of financial assets. There are no derivative financial instruments.\n\nFinancial assets mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. Most of the financial liabilities are current liabilities which are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe available financial instruments are shown in the statement of financial position. The maximum loss or default risk equals the sum total of financial assets. Any risk identified for financial assets is recognised at its impairment charge.\n\n#### Risk management\n\nAll of the Instone Group's financial activities are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial policy. There are also function-specific operational work instructions on topics such as the handling of collateral.\n\nThese guidelines contain the principles used to address the different types of financial risks.\n\nTrading, controlling and billing are handled separately by the front and back office. This ensures effective risk management. The monitoring and billing of the external trading activities of the Front Office is carried out by a separate and independent back office. Furthermore, the dual control principle must be maintained at least for all external trading activities. Internal powers to issue instructions are limited in number and amount, reviewed regularly (at least once a year) and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the interests of shareholders, promissory note investors and the issuing banks in its financial management. Financial and non-financial covenants arise from the contractual conditions of the promissory note loans, the fixed term loan and the syndicated loan. The covenants include compliance with the leverage, the interest rate, equity and loan to value. The potential financial risks resulting from the contractual conditions were not considered to be material as of the reporting date 31 December 2023. The loans are not secured and the Instone Group complied with all obligations in this regard in the financial year as well as in the previous year. For the subsequent periods, the Instone Group monitors the future development as part of Group-wide financial risk management and also continues to anticipate compliance with the contractual terms. This assessment remains unchanged in light of the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n#### Management of liquidity risk\n\nThe Instone Group uses largely centralised structures for pooling cash and cash equivalents at Group level to avoid, among other things, bottlenecks in cash flow at individual Group company level. The central liquidity position is calculated monthly and using a bottom-up method over a rolling twelve-month period. The liquidity planning is supplemented by monthly stress tests.\n\nThe following tables show the contractually agreed residual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods that apply to the Instone Group. The tables are recorded on the basis of the non-discounted cash flows of the financial liabilities with the date which the Instone Group can be asked to repay. The tables contain the cash flow from interest and principal receivable.\n\nInterest payments for items with variable rates are uniformly translated using the last interest rate in effect before the key date.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2023 includes promissory note loans issued from the years 2019 (nominal value: €5,000 thousand), 2020 (nominal value: €100,000 thousand), 2022 (nominal value: €50,000 thousand) and 2023 (nominal value:€20,000 thousand). These financial liabilities are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Impairment losses are recognised if there is an expected loss on the basis of the credit risk. The Instone Group uses the simplified value reduction model of IFRS 9 on all trade receivables, as well as contract assets and therefore records the expected losses over the total term.\n\nThe maximum default risk from financial assets corresponds to their respective carrying amounts stated in the statement of financial position. However, the de facto default risk is lower, as collateral has been provided in favour of the Instone Group. The maximum risk from financial guarantees is equal to the maximum amount that the Instone Group would have to pay. The maximum default risk from loan commitments is equal to the amount of the commitment. We consider it highly unlikely at the time of reporting that these financial guarantees and loan commitments would be used.\n\nThe Instone Group accepts collateral to secure the fulfilment of the contract by subcontractors, the warranty provisions of the subcontractors and fee claims. These securities include, but are not limited to, warranty guarantees, contract performance guarantees, advance payments and payment guarantees. The Instone Group has relevant guidelines for the acceptance of collateral. They include, among other things, rules on contract structure, contract implementation and contract management for all contracts. The exact specifications vary and depend, for example, on the country, jurisdiction and current case law. With regard to default risks, the Instone Group checks the creditworthiness of the guaranteeing party for all accepted collateral. The Instone Group engages external experts (such as rating agencies) to assess their creditworthiness as much as possible. The fair value of accepted collateral is not disclosed, as it cannot usually be determined reliably.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe age structure of overdue financial assets is typical for the sector. The receipt of a payment depends on the order acceptance and invoice verification, which often take a relatively long time. Contract assets are not subject to impairment.\n\nThe ongoing changes in the 2023 financial year are based on additions, liquidations and utilisations and amount to €374 thousand (previous year: €966thousand) meaning that, as at 31 December 2023, there is an impairment loss on trade receivables of €421 thousand (previous year: €849 thousand).\n\nThe following table shows the overdue and non-overdue, impaired financial assets:\n\n#### **Impairments pursuant to IFRS 9 in 2023 TABLE 101**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n| In thousands of euros                     |                 |             |                          |                          |                          |                              |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--|\n|                                           | Carrying amount | Non-overdue | Up to 30<br>days overdue | 31 to 60<br>days overdue | 61 to 90<br>days overdue | More than 90<br>days overdue |  |\n| Trade receivables (gross carrying amount) | 6,889           | 4,433       | 77                       | 101                      | 20                       | 2,258                        |  |\n| Impairment provisions                     | -421            | -43         | -1                       | -1                       | 0                        | -376                         |  |\n| Trade receivables (net carrying amount)   | 6,467           | 4,390       | 76                       | 100                      | 20                       | 1,882                        |  |\n\n#### **Impairments pursuant to IFRS 9 in 2022 TABLE 102**\n\n| In thousands of euros                     |                 |             |                          |                          |                          |                              |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                           | Carrying amount | Non-overdue | Up to 30<br>days overdue | 31 to 60<br>days overdue | 61 to 90<br>days overdue | More than 90<br>days overdue |\n| Trade receivables (gross carrying amount) | 3,627           | 1,322       | 460                      | 34                       | 39                       | 1,772                        |\n| Impairment provisions                     | -849            | -13         | -5                       | 0                        | 0                        | -831                         |\n| Trade receivables (net carrying amount)   | 2,778           | 1,309       | 455                      | 34                       | 39                       | 941                          |\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Control of interest rate risks\n\nThe interest rate risk of the Instone Group is mainly related to current and non-current interest bearing financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Depending on the situation in the market, this risk is countered by a mix of fixed income and variable interest rate financial instruments. The risk is not managed separately, as borrowed funds are usually repaid promptly using the payments made by the acquirers.\n\nChanges in market interest rates for non-derivative financial instruments with a fixed interest rate are only recognised in profit or loss if they are measured at fair value. For this reason, all financial instruments recognised at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risks as defined by IFRS 9.\n\nAs part of a sensitivity analysis, we examined the effects of changes in market interest rates on consolidated earnings after tax over a range of 100 basis points. In the financial year, a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by 100 basis points (provided other variables remain constant) would result in an increase or decrease of consolidated earnings of €2,219 thousand (previous year: decrease in consolidated earnings of €1,742 thousand or increase in consolidated earnings of €910 thousand).\n\n#### Control of the capital risk\n\nThe Instone Group manages its capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies continue to operate on a going concern basis. The Instone Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible. It achieves this by optimising the ratio of equity to debt on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of current and non-current liabilities less the cash and cash equivalents reported in the statement of financial position and in equity. The capital structure of the Group is reviewed regularly. The risk-adjusted capital costs are also taken into account.\n\nThe overall strategy for controlling the capital risk did not change in the financial year compared to the previous year.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Further disclosures on financial instruments\n\n#### **[To our

information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWith the short-term financial instruments accounted for at amortised costs, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value, due to the short remaining term to maturity. In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the carrying amount of a part corresponds to the fair value due to the variable interest rate. A fair value was determined for the fixed-interest non-current liabilities, which exceeds the carrying amount by €4,272 thousand as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: €-17,493 thousand). Non-current fixed-interest liabilities are assigned to\n\nlevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value was determined using a cash value method using company-specific current interest rates derived from the market. Non-current financial receivables are recognised at amortised costs. Their fair value differs from the carrying amount by €73 thousand (previous year: €-506 thousand).

We have not audited the contents of the references to texts extraneous to the notes of the consolidated financial statements marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the General Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively. In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the parent and the group of Instone Real Estate Group SE, Essen/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the corporate governance statement in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d German Commercial Code (HGB) included in section \"Other information\" of the combined management report, including the further reporting on corporate governance included therein. Further-more, we have neither audited the contents of the \"Sustainability report\" included in the combined management report nor the references to texts extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- → the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023; our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the references extraneous to the notes of the consolidated financial statements as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively, and\n- → the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the the con-tents of section \"Sustainability report\" and the afore-mentioned corporate governance statement including the further reporting on corporate governance included therein as well as the references extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nand German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following we present the over time revenue recognition including the valuation of contract assets or inventories, which we have determined to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\na. description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)\n\nb. auditor's response\n\n#### Over time revenue recognition including the valuation of contract assets or inventories\n\na. The consolidated financial statements of Instone Real Estate Group SE, Essen/Germany, as at 31 December 2023 disclosed contract assets of kEUR 177,069, inventories of kEUR 1,085,840 and revenue of kEUR 503,496 arising from the development of residential and multifamily houses, from the creation of concepts for urban quarters, from the reconstruction of heritage-protected properties as well as from governmentally-subsidised housing construction (real estate developer activities) in Germany. In application of the provisions of IFRS 15 on revenue realisation, sold units under development are realised according to over time revenue recognition. In this respect, the service rendered including the proportionate result is disclosed in revenue corresponding to the level of completion. With the exception of reconstruction properties, revenue for these matters is generally recognised as soon as the respective project has reached a marketing level of 30%. The contractually conceded right to withdraw expires for both parties as of this point in time. In the case of reconstruction properties, revenue is recognised when construction activities begin.\n\nThe amount of revenue realised for a construction project as well as the measurement of contract assets and inventories depend on the following parameters:\n\n- → Marketing level\n- → Level of completion as well as actual costs incurred as at the balance sheet date\n- → Estimation of total income and total costs\n\nWhile the marketed parts of the construction projects are disclosed under contract assets after balancing with prepayments received or alternatively under contract liabilities, non-marketed parts of construction projects are disclosed under inventories.\n\nRevenue realisation and the measurement of contract assets and inventories is – to an extraordinary extent – based on the executive directors' estimations and assumptions regarding the amount of total costs, deferral of costs as at the balance sheet date as well as the estimation of total revenue of the respective project. The executive\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\ndirectors' estimations subject to judgement have a direct and predominantly significant effect on the amount of revenue realised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and the amount of contract assets and inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nHence, we have deemed this matter to be a key audit matter.\n\nInformation on the revenue realisation as well as on the measurement of contract assets and inventories were presented by the executive directors in the section \"Basis of the consolidated financial statements\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb. When auditing revenue, contract assets and inventories, we assessed the recognition method applied and – involving internal specialists – assessed the measurement in compliance with the regulations of IFRS 15. During our audit, we have recorded the main processes from project acceptance (acquisition of a property) to project conclusion (construction activities and sale of the individual flats) as well as the procedure on the monthly deferral of costs and examined relevant control procedures on appropriateness and effectiveness. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. Based on a risk-oriented sample selection, we have conducted site visits of projects and based on which we reviewed the estimations and assumptions made by the executive directors as at the balance sheet date. We verified the deferral of expenses by reference to appropriate evidence based on a random sample selection. In addition, we have examined the plausibility of the deferral entries made as at the balance sheet date. We have assessed the projected total revenue and total expenses by involving internal specialists and their professional and industry expertise. We have assessed relevant disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding completeness and accuracy.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises\n\n→ the report of the supervisory board,\n\n- → the corporate governance statement, including the further reporting on corporate governance included there-in, in section \"Corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report,\n- → the references in the combined management report and in the consolidated notes to the financial statements marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively,\n- → the \"Sustainability report\" section included in the combined management report,\n- → the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and\n- → all other parts of the annual report,\n- → but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) concerning the German Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the corporate governance statement included in section \"Corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report. Otherwise the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n→ is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n\n→ otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to pro-vide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\n{260}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n- **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n- **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- → identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- → obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- → evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- → conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- → evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial\n\nstatements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\n- → obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- → evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- → perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\n# ←\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.

In doing so, it also takes into account the requirements of the German Accounting Standard No. 17 (DRS) and the HGB.\n\n#### **I. Remuneration System for the Members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE**\n\nThe current remuneration system for the members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE was approved by the Supervisory Board in the 2021 financial year and submitted to the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 9 June 2021, which approved the remuneration system described in this number I, which came into force as from 1 July 2021, with 98.27% voting to approve it. The complete [remuneration system is available at](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html) ä http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/ instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html.\n\nThe remuneration system is geared toward sustainable and long-term corporate development. Transparency and traceability of the remuneration system and the individual remuneration of the Management Board members are key components of good corporate governance at Instone Real Estate Group SE.\n\nThe remuneration system applies for a maximum period of four years to all new contract of employment concluded with members of the Management Board and for contract extensions and adjustments from 1 July 2021. Therefore, the employment contracts of members of the Management Board in place on the date on which the remuneration system came into force have been revised with effect from 1 July 2021 in accordance with the provisions and regulations of the new remuneration system. Remuneration claims established before 1 July 2021, including those relating to variable remuneration, therefore continue to be based on the contractual provisions on which they were based at the time.\n\nThe main components of the remuneration system are as follows:\n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                      | Remuneration component

Contribution of remuneration to supporting the business strategy and the long-term development of the company**\n\nThe calculation of the remuneration is mainly based on the size and complexity of the Instone Group, its economic situation and financial position, and its success and future prospects. Other material criteria for setting the remuneration include the duties and personal performance of the individual members of the Management Board. The remuneration system defines remuneration that is competitive in national and international comparison, which creates added value for customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders by defining performance criteria relating in particular to the long-term and sustainable success of the company and linking them with challenging targets. These targets set by the Supervisory Board for variable remuneration are in line with the corporate strategy and ensure the synchronisation of the remuneration of the Management Board and the long-term development of the company through a link with corporate planning.\n\n### **B. Procedures for Determining and Implementing the Remuneration of the Management Board and for Reviewing the Remuneration System**\n\nResponsibility for preparing the remuneration system, setting the actual total emoluments of the individual members of the Management Board and the regular review of the remuneration system lies with the Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE. The Supervisory Board has set up a remuneration committee, which is responsible, in particular, for advising on the contracts of employment of the members of the Management Board and for preparing the relevant resolutions as well as preparing setting the targets for the variable remuneration components and their assessment by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system at regular intervals on the basis of the preparations and recommendations of the remuneration committee. If the Supervisory Board determines that action must be taken, it decides on any changes deemed necessary and the remuneration system is presented to the Annual General Meeting again for approval if required.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may call on external consultants to help it fulfil its duties and they must be independent of the Management Board and Instone Real Estate Group SE and has in fact done so for the preparation of the current remuneration system. The rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board contain provisions for dealing with potential conflicts of interest in the Supervisory Board , which include disclosure of potential conflicts of interest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board, a ban on participating and voting in the event of identified conflicts of interest and also apply to remuneration matters.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting shall decide on the remuneration system in the event of any significant change to the remuneration system but at least every four years. If the Annual General Meeting has not approved the remuneration system, a revised remuneration system must be submitted for approval to the next Annual General Meeting at the latest.\n\n### **C. Determination and Appropriateness of Remuneration**\n\nIn keeping with the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board has set the total target remuneration and relevant upper remuneration limits (caps) for each member of the Management Board. The remuneration is proportionate to the duties and performance of the Management Board member and to the situation of the Instone Group, will not exceed the usual remuneration without special reasons and is geared toward the long-term and sustainable development of the Instone Group. The appropriateness of the remuneration is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board. Both external and internal comparison analyses are carried out for this purpose.\n\n#### Consideration of Employee Remuneration and Employment Conditions and Peer Group Comparison\n\nThe internal analysis was carried out as part of the preparation of the current remuneration system in the form of a vertical comparison of the remuneration and employment conditions of employees. The remuneration levels of the members of the Management Board were set in relation to the remuneration levels of the senior management and the workforce as a whole. These two employee groups were defined by the Supervisory Board. The senior management includes the managing directors of the subsidiaries and the workforce as a whole is made up of the full-time employees of the Instone Group in Germany (including senior management). The results of the vertical comparison were taken into account in determining the remuneration system and future adjustments to the remuneration level of the Management Board – including its development over time.\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-269-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nTo develop the remuneration system and check the appropriateness of the remuneration conditions, the Supervisory Board also carried out an external comparative analysis of remuneration levels using two peer groups (industry and growth peer groups). The members of the industry peer group were selected on the basis of six criteria (company size, sector, in other words direct competitors or companies in other sectors with comparable characteristics – in particular real estate, land, legal form, equity market basis and relevant labour markets) on the premise that they are as comparable as possible with Instone Real Estate Group SE. Due to the considerable growth of the Instone Group since the IPO, a second growth peer group was also formed, which is comparable with Instone Real Estate Group SE in terms of sales growth rates, company size and region.\n\n#### **D. Remuneration Components**\n\nThe total remuneration of the individual members of the Management Board consists of various components. In terms of structure, the remuneration components for all members of the Management Board are regulated in the same way using estimates, since the amount of fringe benefits in particular may vary as part of the performance-independent remuneration:\n\n|                                                            | TABLE 10    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Annual target remuneration                                 | 100%        |\n| – of which non-performance related emoluments              | approx. 40% |\n| – of which performance-based emoluments – short-term (STI) | approx. 25% |\n| – of which performance-based emoluments – long-term (LTI)  | approx. 35% |\n\nThe remuneration of the Management Board consists of non-performancerelated salary and benefits in kind, performance-related (variable) remuneration and (in the case of two Management Board members) pension commitments agreed before their appointment to the Management Board, for which the additions by the Company up to 2020 correspond to an annual pension benefit from the age of 65, which is expected to be between 3% and 5% of the current annual basic remuneration that is independent of the performance of the company. Variable remuneration is based on a multi-year assessment basis in order to create incentives for sustainable and long-term corporate development. The remuneration system explicitly stipulates that both positive and negative developments are taken into account. The Supervisory Board also sets a maximum amount (cap) for each variable remuneration component. Management Board remuneration is highly performance-related, with a particular focus on long-term variable remuneration.\n\nThus, the STI bonus amounts to approximately 62.5% for achieving 100% of the targets and approximately 125% of the non-performance related emoluments for achieving the maximum targets. Due to its even stronger weighting, the LTI bonus is approximately 87.5% for achieving 100% of the targets and approximately 262.5% of the non-performance related emoluments for achieving the maximum targets.\n\nIn principle, this remuneration covers all activities for the Company and for those activities with the Company under Sections 15 et seqq. German Stock Corporation Ac[t. GRI 2-21](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Non-performance related emoluments\n\nThe members of Instone Real Estate Group SE's Management Board receive non-performance-related emoluments in the form of a fixed base annual salary (base remuneration) and fringe benefits. The fixed annual base salary is paid in twelve equal instalments at the end of a month, and for the last time for the full month in which the Management Board employment contract ends.\n\nThe members of the Management Board also receive non-performancerelated fringe benefits. These include, for example, the use of a company car and the payment of premiums for accident insurance with payments at a standard market level and are taken into consideration in the maximum remuneration of the Management Board.\n\n#### Performance-based emoluments\n\nThe performance-based remuneration components consist of a variable remuneration element with a (one-year) short-term incentive [STI] and a variable remuneration element with a multi-year assessment basis (longterm incentive [LTI]). Due to the design of the components, the share of the LTI outweighs the share of the STI in the target remuneration.\n\nIf the Management Board member is not entitled to remuneration for the entire financial year underlying the calculation, a corresponding pro rata reduction of this variable remuneration component is made.\n\n{270}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nOne-Year Variable Remuneration – Short-Term Incentive (STI)\n\nThe one-year variable remuneration in the form of the STI is linked to\n\n→ the financial result or performance of the Instone Group in the underlying financial year (financial targets) and\n\n→ the strategy and sustainability goals defined for the individual members of the Management Board.\n\n| Financial year 0          | Financial year 1                    |            | Financial year 2                       |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| STI bonus base amount (€) | Performance period                  |            | Payment (€)                            |\n|                           | Targets:                            | Weighting: |                                        |\n|                           | Financial targets:                  | 75%        |                                        |\n|                           | EAT (adjusted)                      | 37.5%      |                                        |\n|                           | Volume of sales contracts           | 37.5%      |                                        |\n|                           | Strategy and sustainability targets | 25%        | Cap: 200% of the STI bonus base amount |\n\nThe financial targets set out in the STI, which account for a total of 75% of the STI bonus base amount, are made up of earnings after tax (EAT [adjusted]) and the volume of sales contracts, both being weighted identically with 37.5% each. Both the EAT (adjusted) and the volume of sales contracts are key operating financial and management key figures and performance indicators of the Instone Group and are part of the company's forecast. Both financial targets are therefore decisive for the corporate strategy of the Management Board and the long-term development of the Instone Group. In the view of the Supervisory Board, the measurement of short-term variable remuneration on the basis of these key operating financial and management indicators and performance indicators seems appropriate in order to ensure that the Management Board is incentivised to implement the corporate strategy. The EAT (adjusted) result-based key figure is also the benchmark for the dividend policy. The real estate business key performance indicators of the volume\n\nof sales contracts includes all sales-related transactions, such as notarised real estate purchase agreements, individual orders from customers and rental income. Both financial targets are derived from the corporate planning prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board and the forecast, and are set uniformly for the Management Board for each bonus year. The EAT (adjusted) and the volume of sales contracts are determined on the basis of the adjusted results of operations on which the financial reporting of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based and which is explained in more detail in the management report o[n page 133 et seqq..](#page-132-0)\n\nThe linking of the one-year variable remuneration with these key financial and management key figures of the Instone Group serves to ensure profitable and sustainable growth. In addition, the selection of these targets provides incentives for the Management Board to act in accordance with the corporate strategy and the planning approved by the Supervisory Board or to exceed the forecast communicated to the capital market in the best case scenario.\n\n**The strategy and sustainability targets** relevant for the relevant bonus year are set individually by the Supervisory Board for each bonus year and for each member of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board usually sets two to four targets for each member of the Management Board which serve to implement corporate strategy and long-term corporate development. The strategy and sustainability targets are included in the STI bonus at 25%. This gives the Supervisory Board the opportunity to define central, not necessarily financial targets for the Management Board in the company's interest and to link them to the personal performance of the Management Board members. These targets may include environmental concerns such as CO2 reduction, customer and employee satisfaction, the value of investor sales or the improvement of corporate financing as well as the promotion and development of the new nyoo product line (affordable housing) or the construction of subsidised housing. To ensure sufficient transparency and traceability of the achievement of objectives, the Supervisory Board ensures that targets are set or criteria defined for the targets, the achievement of which can ideally be determined and measured using quantitative methods. The Supervisory Board can weigh the annual strategy and sustainability targets differently, whereby each individual target must be weighted with a minimum of at least 25% within the strategy and sustainability targets.\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nAn STI bonus base amount in euros is agreed for each member of the Management Board in their contract of employment. The payment amount of this variable compensation component is set depending on the achievement of the targets for which the Supervisory Board sets the target or threshold values to be achieved for each performance period, then as follows:\n\n- → At the end of the relevant bonus year (performance period), the Supervisory Board defines the target achievement for each individual target and converts the target achievement into an overall target achievement, taking into account the weighting of all the individual targets. The maximum target achievement for each individual STI target is capped at 175%.\n- → The overall target achievement is assigned to an STI payout factor using the bonus curve shown in figure 026. If the overall target achievement falls below 75% **(lower target limit)**, there is no entitlement to a payment of the STI bonus. Due to the ambitious target setting, above-average performance by the members of the Management Board is disproportionately rewarded: If the overall target achievement is 150% or more **(target cap)**, the STI payout factor is 200%. The STI payout factor for an overall target achievement of between 100% and 150% is calculated on a proportional basis If the overall target achievement is between 75% and 100%, the STI payout factor corresponds to the overall target achievement on a linear basis.\n- → The STI payout factor is multiplied by the agreed STI bonus base amount and thus results in the payout amount of the STI bonus in euros for the performance period. The payout amount may reach a maximum of 200% of the STI bonus base amount **(cap)**. The payment is made in the month following approval of the audited annual financial statements of the Company.\n\nBelow is an example of the overall goal achievement at STI and the resulting STI payout factor:\n\nImage /page/271/Figure/15 description: The image shows a bonus curve for overall target achievement. The x-axis represents the overall target achievement, and the y-axis represents the payment factor. The curve starts at 0% payment factor for less than 75% overall target achievement. At 75% overall target achievement, the payment factor is approximately 75%. At 100% overall target achievement, the payment factor is 100%. An overall target achievement of 150% or more leads to the maximum payment factor of 200%.\n\n#### Multi-Year Variable Remuneration (Long-Term Incentive (LTI))\n\nAnother component of variable remuneration is that the members of the Management Board are also promised multi-year variable compensation in the form of an LTI bonus on the basis of a share-based virtual performance share plan. By linking the share price of Instone Group shares, incentives are provided for the Management Board to promote the long-term and sustainable development of the Instone Group. In addition, the interests of shareholders and the Management Board are strengthened.\n\nImage /page/271/Figure/18 description: This image shows a diagram of variable compensation - LTI. The diagram includes the following elements: Financial year 0, Financial year 1, Financial year 2, Financial year 3, Financial year 4, STI bonus base amount (€), Share price for the last three months of financial year 3, Share price of the last three months of financial year 0, Provisional virtual share tranche (base number), Share price performance, Performance period, LTI bonus payment factor 0-300%, Cap: 300%, Targets, Weighting, Financial targets: 70%, Relative TSR vs SDAX 20%, Earnings per share 50%, ESG target 30%, Final virtual share tranche, Sum total of hypothetically reinvested distributions, Payment amount in €, Cap: 300% of the LTI bonus base amount.\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe amount of any LTI bonus depends on\n\n- → The amount of the LTI bonus base amount and the average share price used as a basis at the time of the allocation of the virtual share tranche in financial year 0, in other words the financial year before the start of the three-year performance period,\n- → Achieving financial and non-financial ESG targets during a three-year performance period and\n- → The share price performance (taking into account dividends) of Instone Real Estate Group SE during the three-year performance period.\n\nThe assessment period for the multi-year variable remuneration is therefore a total of three years.\n\nThe financial targets set out in the LTI are the development of the adjusted earnings per share **(EPS)** and the total shareholder return (share price performance taking into account dividends) of Instone Real Estate Group SE compared to the SDAX **(relative TSR)** representing a total of 70% of the LTI bonus base amount and weighted at 50% and 20% respectively. Both financial targets are derived from the corporate planning prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board and the forecast, and are set uniformly for the Management Board for each threeyear performance period.\n\nThe **EPS target** sets a target by which the Management Board is incentivised to increase the long-term profitability of the company on the basis of the multi-year performance period. This creates an incentive to manage the company for profit while at the same time generating sustainable growth in the long-term in the interest of the shareholders. The EPS target is set in the form of an aggregated target value over the performance period. The EPS target is calculated on the basis of the adjusted results of operations on which the financial reporting of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based and which is explained in more detail in the management report on page [133 et seqq..](#page-132-0)\n\nThe **relative TSR** provides an incentive for the Management Board to deliver above-average performance compared to other listed companies. The development of the share price also reflects the increase in the value of the company from the shareholder's point of view. The Supervisory Board\n\nconsiders the SDAX, which consists of companies of a comparable size and in which the Instone Group share was listed until the end of the last financial year, to be an appropriate benchmark. However, since the Instone Group share is currently no longer listed in the SDAX or in the event that the SDAX is subject to significant changes or that other developments occur that no longer make a reference to the SDAX appear appropriate, the Supervisory Board may also choose another suitable share index as a reference value for the remuneration system.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also sets a non-financial **ESG** (Environmental, Social and Governance) target, which accounts for 30% of the LTI bonus base amount. The ESG target, which is set uniformly for each annual LTI tranche granted to all members of the Management Board, is intended to encourage the sustainable development of the Instone Group in accordance with the Company's ESG strategy. The Supervisory Board will define a target that is in line with the interests of the company's stakeholders and is geared toward achieving a long-term, three-year target. The measurement of the target achievement is ideally designed to be quantifiable.\n\nAn LTI bonus base amount in euros is agreed for each member of the Management Board in their contract of employment. This is divided by the average volume-weighted Instone Group share price of the last three months of the financial year before the start of the performance period to determine a provisional tranche of virtual shares allocated to the relevant Management Board member **(base number)**. The payment amount of this variable compensation component is set depending on the achievement of the targets for which the Supervisory Board sets the target or threshold values to be achieved for each performance period and the share price performance of Instone Group shares, then as follows:\n\n- → At the end of the three-year performance period, the Supervisory Board decides the achievement of targets for each individual target.\n- → The target achievement for each individual target is assigned to an LTI payout factor using the bonus curve shown in figure 029. Taking into account the relevant weighting of the individ[ual target, a](#page-273-0) total payout factor is formed from the individual LTI payout factors defined in this way. Due to the ambitious target setting, above-average performance by the members of the Management Board is disproportionately rewarded: If the target achievement is 150% or more for an individual target **(upper target limit)**, the relevant LTI payout factor for this\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-273-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nindividual target is 300%. The LTI payout factor for a target achievement of between 100% and 150% is calculated on a proportional basis If the target achievement for an individual target is 100% or less, the LTI payout factor corresponds to the relevant target achievement (subject to and up to a **lower target limit** defined by the Supervisory Board ).\n\n→ To determine the relative TSR, the final price of the Instone Group share is compared to the initial price. For the purpose of smoothing out the initial and final price, the volume-weighted average of the closing prices of the Instone Group share in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the previous three months is used to determine the initial and final price, including dividend payments, are also used for the final price. assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period. For the calculation of the development of the SDAX (as a performance index), the initial value is the arithmetic mean of the closing balances in the SDAX of the last three months before the beginning of the performance period and the final value is the arithmetic mean of the closing balances of the SDAX over the last three months of the relevant three-year performance period. The target achievement for the relative TSR and the pro rata LTI payout factor is 100% if, at the end of the performance period, the development of the share price (including dividend payments, assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period) of the Instone Group share corresponds to the development of the SDAX. If the target achievement for the relative TSR is less than 75%, this target is considered to have been missed and it is shown in figure 028.\n\n→ The base number of virtual shares is multiplied by the total payout factor and the average volume-weighted share price of the last three months prior to the end of the last financial year of the performance period, taking into account dividend payments, assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period (total shareholder return approach), in order to equate the Management Board with a real shareholder. The payment is made after the end of the performance. in the month following approval of the audited annual financial statements of the Company.\n\nThe following is an example of the bonus curves for the relative TSR target (see figure above) and for calculating the additional LTI payout factors (EPS target and ESG target) (see figure below):\n\nImage /page/273/Figure/13 description: This image shows a bonus curve for relative TSR (Total Shareholder Return). The x-axis represents target achievement, and the y-axis represents the payout factor. The curve starts at 0% payout for target achievement less than 75%. At 75% target achievement (Outperformance -25%), the payout factor jumps to 75%. The payout factor increases linearly from 75% to 300% as the target achievement increases from 75% to 150% (Outperformance 50%). A target achievement rate of 150% or more results in the maximum payout factor of 300%.\n\nImage /page/273/Figure/14 description: The image shows a bonus curve for LTI payout factors.

The solid line starts at 0%, increases to 100% at 100% target achievement, and then increases to 300% at 150% target achievement. The image also contains the text \"Bonus curve - LTI payout factors\" and \"FIGURE 029\".\n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn the event of an extraordinary development in the share price, the Supervisory Board is entitled to take into account a reasonable longer period before the end of the relevant bonus year for calculating the average closing price. If capital measures lead to a reduction or increase in the number of Instone Group shares (for example, share splits or share consolidation), this effect is taken into account by means of suitable calculations when determining the target achievement and its effect is neutralised.\n\nThe payout amount of the LTI bonus is capped at an amount corresponding to 300% of the LTI bonus base amount (LTI cap).\n\n#### Share Ownership Guideline\n\nTo strengthen the long-term development and encourage the investment of the Management Board in Instone Real Estate Group SE, the members of the Management Board are obliged by a Share Ownership Guideline to complete a four-year development phase by acquiring shares in Instone Real Estate Group SE in the amount of a gross annual salary that is independent of their performance and holding them for the entire term of their Management Board contract, starting with their appointment to the Management Board. The equivalent value is based on the purchase price of the shares. The shares already held by a member of the Management Board are added to this figure.\n\nIf the relevant Management Board member has acquired shares in the amount of a gross annual salary not dependent on performance, the ownership level must not fall below this threshold by up to 50% for a maximum period of six months.\n\nIn this case, the Management Board member is obliged to add to the number of shares held within a period of six months up to the amount of a gross annual salary that is not dependent on performance.\n\n### **E. Definition of Maximum Remuneration and Temporary Deviations from the Remuneration System**\n\n#### Maximum remuneration\n\nUnder Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board has set a maximum amount for the total of all remuneration components, including fringe benefits and pension commitments. This amounts to €3.1 million for the Chairman of the\n\nManagement Board (CEO) and €2.35 million for the other members of the Management Board. The maximum remuneration defined by the Supervisory Board takes into account the findings of the peer group analysis as well as the strongly performance and growth-focused structure of the Management Board remuneration system and is intended to enable the market-based and company-specific development of the Management Board remuneration in the interest of the company.\n\n#### Temporary Deviations from the Remuneration System\n\nA deviation from the remuneration system is possible on an exceptional basis for the Supervisory Board under the legal provision of Section 87a (2) sentence 2 AktG if exceptional circumstances make a deviation necessary in the interest of the long-term well-being of the company. This requires a Supervisory Board resolution that establishes the need for a deviation in a transparent and justified manner. The components of the remuneration system specifically affected by the deviation and the necessity of the deviation must also be explained to the shareholders in the remuneration report. A deviation may be made if the described requirements are satisfied, in particular from the performance criteria of the variable remuneration, the ratio of the components of the target remuneration and for exceptional fringe benefits.\n\n### **F. Opportunities for the Company to Reclaim Variable Remuneration Components**\n\nThe contracts of employment of Management Board members contain provisions that give the Supervisory Board discretion to retain (malus) or recover (clawback) part or all of the variable remuneration components. The requirement for the application of these regulations is grossly negligent and serious violation of statutory or contractual duties or the Company's internal codes of conduct. In such cases, the Supervisory Board may, at its reasonable discretion, reduce and retain variable remuneration components that have not yet been paid out or demand repayment of variable remuneration components that have already been paid out.\n\nThe aforementioned claims shall lapse two years after the end of the assessment period of the relevant variable remuneration component.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **G. Remuneration-Related Legal Transactions**\n\nTerms and conditions for the termination of remuneration-related legal transactions\n\nThe term of the Management Board contracts runs in parallel with the term of appointment of the Management Board member as decided by the Supervisory Board. Each contract of employment has a fixed term and therefore does not contain an ordinary right of termination. The right to extraordinary termination is unaffected.\n\n#### Compensation for Dismissal\n\nIf the employment contract of a member of the Management Board is terminated extraordinarily by the Company for good cause before the end of the term of the LTI bonus (so-called \"bad leaver case\"), this will result in the expiry of all rights arising from the LTI bonus which is attributable to a period before the expiry of the respective term of three years.\n\nIf the contract of employment of a Management Board member ends before the end of the term of the LTI bonus and the other requirements for a \"bad leaver case\" do not exist at the same time (so-called \"good leaver case\"), the entitlement to the LTI bonus from performance periods that are already ongoing and, if applicable, pro rata for the upcoming performance period will remain in force.\n\nSpecial termination rights were agreed with the members of the Management Board in the event of a change of control. The members of the Management Board are entitled to a severance payment if, in addition to a change of control, the basis on which they can run the business suffers a significant adverse effect, in other words if the Management Board member loses their position, the Company is merged, all or a significant portion of the Company's assets are transferred to third party legal entities that do not belong to the Instone Group, a control and/or profit transfer agreement is concluded with the Company as a dependent company, the legal form of the Company is changed and the Management Board member thereby loses the independence granted by the German Stock Corporation Act or the SE-VO or if the decision-making powers of the terminating Management Board member suffer significant adverse effect for no material reason. Under the employment contract of a Management Board member, the conclusion of a control and/or profit transfer agreement with the Company as obligated parties does not qualify as a significant adverse effect in the running of the business under certain conditions. In addition, the members of the Management Board have special termination rights in the event of\n\ndismissal due to a loss of confidence at the Annual General Meeting or resignation from office for a material reason.\n\nIn the event that a special right of termination is exercised, the terminating member of the Management Board is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of 1.5 gross annual remuneration, whereby this severance payment is reduced pro rata temporis if the remaining term of the employment contract that is less than 1.5 years. No severance claim exists if the appointment ends due to dismissal for a material reason within the meaning of Section 626 BGB or due to good cause within the meaning of Section 84 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which is not based on the loss of confidence at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nVariable remuneration components shall also be paid out in the event of premature termination of activities on the Management Board on the basis of the assessment bases originally agreed (performance targets, performance periods etc.) and due dates.\n\n#### Pension commitments\n\nTwo members of the Management Board still have a company pension plan in the form of individual contractual pension agreements which are valid after reaching the minimum pensionable age of 65 years. These two pension agreements were agreed well before the IPO or the appointment of the members entitled to benefits to the Management Board in 2008 and 1987 and will continue to be implemented.\n\nThe two members of the Management Board entitled to the pension provision are credited with the pension component for the duration of the pension commitment as part of this company pension provision model in accordance with the pension agreements with them which form the basis. This will be credited from the time they reach the age of 65 with a specific monthly payment amount, and will cumulatively reflect the respective pension entitlement under the company pension scheme. The respective amount of the monthly pension component is calculated on the basis of the monthly non-performance-related cash remuneration of the members of the Management Board entitled to the benefit, multiplied by an age factor, which maps an appropriate interest rate, and another fixed amount to be determined annually. The necessary provisions for the pension components and the resulting pension obligations are calculated annually in actuarial terms. The amount of the credited pension components decreases with the progressive duration of the pension agreements with otherwise unchanged fixed non-performance-related emoluments[.

Remuneration of Management Board members in the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe following part of the remuneration report provides details of the specific application of the remuneration system to the members of the Management Board and the remuneration of the individual members of the Management Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2022 financial year was approved by the Annual General Meeting of Instone Real Estate Group SE on 14 June 2023 by more than 92% of the votes cast, so there was no reason to change the remuneration system, to question its implementation or the way in which the remuneration of the Management Board and Supervisory Board is reported.\n\n#### Total remuneration\n\nThe total remuneration granted and owed to the current members of the Management Board for the 2023 financial year within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG amounted to a total of €2,190 thousand. Under the explanatory memorandum to Section 162 (1) AktG, the amounts due during the reporting period and already received by the individual member of the Management Board or whose due payment has not yet been made must be stated as the remuneration granted and owed (inflows). The following table shows the total remuneration under these principles, broken down by remuneration components and individually for the current members of the Management Board for the 2023 financial year and the previous year.\n\n#### **Remuneration under Section 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG TABLE 110**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n|                                           | Kruno Crepulja |       |       | Dr. Foruhar<br>Madjlessi3 |       | David Dreyfus4 |       | Andreas Gräf |      |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------|---------------------------|-------|----------------|-------|--------------|------|\n|                                           | CEO            | 2022  |       | CFO                       | 2022  | CFO            | 2022  | COO          | 2022 |\n|                                           | 2023           |       | 2023  |                           | 2023  |                | 2023  |              |      |\n| Non-performance<br>related emoluments     | 526            | 525   | 283   | 437                       | 148   | 0              | 406   | 406          |      |\n| One-off<br>cushion bonus1                 | 0              | 0     | 0     | 0                         | 300   | 0              | 0     | 0            |      |\n| Fringe benefits2                          | 30             | 29    | 4     | 5                         | 3     | 0              | 15    | 15           |      |\n| Short-term variable<br>remuneration (STI) | 0              | 351   | 0     | 316                       | 0     | 0              | 0     | 309          |      |\n| Long-term variable<br>remuneration (LTI)  | 195            | 446   | 163   | 0                         | 0     | 0              | 117   | 268          |      |\n| Total                                     | 751            | 1,351 | 450   | 758                       | 451   | 0              | 538   | 998          |      |\n| Maximum<br>remuneration                   | 3,100          | 3,100 | 2,350 | 2,350                     | 2,145 | 0              | 2,350 | 2,350        |      |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The one-off cushion bonus is the results of Mr Dreyfus taking up his position on the Management Board and is in compliance with the remuneration system.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Excluding pension costs.

target achievement on 11 March 2024 and converted it into an overall target achievement, taking into account the weighting of the individual targets.\n\nThe table shows the weighting, the agreed target values and the actual value (if these can be quantified in each case), the resulting target achievement, the target limits and the payment factors (if applicable).\n\nThe objectives for the personal strategy and sustainability targets include uniform cost-cutting targets defined for all members of the Management Board. For Mr Crepulja, these also include a more specific objective relating to a strategic initiative, a more specific objective for Mr Gräf for reviewing and realigning specific sales strategies, for Dr Madjlessi the development of ICS-specific organisational structures and for Mr Dreyfus the successful implementation of these structures. The respective target achievement was assessed by way of an overall evaluation of both targets.\n\n|  |  |  |  | STI financial year 2023 - payment 2024 |

The LTI bonus base amount shown reflects this pro rata temporis.\n\n#### LTI tranches granted\n\nThe LTI tranches granted as of 31 December 2023 are shown in the table below, broken down by individual members of the Management Board.\n\nThe LTI tranches have a term of three years and are only paid out at the end of the relevant term at the average closing prices of the Instone Group share determined at that time.\n\nIn the case of the LTI tranches referred to as \"(old)\", which were still granted under the remuneration system until 30 June 2021, the basic number of virtual shares granted is multiplied by the average closing price of the Instone Group share during the last 20 trading days of the relevant term, plus any dividend paid. The payout amount calculated in this way is capped for each virtual share in the LTI tranches (old) at the amount that corresponds to 200% of the initial value determined for the relevant bonus year. For the determination of the LTI initial value at the time the LTI tranches were granted, a planned/actual comparison was made of the adjusted earnings before tax for the bonus year as well as the two previous years and virtual shares were allocated at the average price during the last 20 trading days before the end of the bonus year. During the term of the LTI tranches (old), no performance criteria are applied, so the final payout amount is therefore exclusively dependent on the share price performance of Instone Group shares.\n\nFor the LTI tranches referred to as (new), the payment is made using the outline parameters described i[n I.

Our audit opinion does not cover the content of the remuneration report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 (3) AktG and in compliance with the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Remuneration Report pursuant to Section 162 (3) AktG (IDW AuS 870 (09.2023)). Our responsibilities under those requirements and this standard are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities\" section of our report. Our audit firm has applied the IDW Quality Management Standards. We have fulfilled our professional responsibilities in accordance with the German Public Auditor Act (WPO) and the Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP) including the requirements on independence.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe executive board and the supervisory board are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of Section 162 AktG. In addition, they are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including their related disclosures, that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities**\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made, in all material respects, in the remuneration report, and to express an opinion on this in a report on the audit.\n\nWe planned and conducted our audit in such a way to be able to determine whether the remuneration report is formally complete by comparing the disclosures made in the remuneration report with the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG. In accordance with Section 162 (3) AktG, we have neither audited the correctness of the content of the disclosures, nor the completeness of the content of the individual disclosures, nor the adequate presentation of the remuneration report.\n\nDusseldorf/Germany, 11 March 2024\n\n#### **Deloitte GmbH**\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSigned: Rolf Künemann Signed: Nicole Meyer Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüferin (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor)\n\nSigned: Nicole Meyer\nWirtschaftsprüferin\n(German Public Auditor)\n\n{285}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-285-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n **Other information**\n\n### **Assurance of legal representatives**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we declare that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the results of operations, net assets and financial position of the Group in accordance with the applicable accounting principles and that the management report of the Group, which is combined with the Company's management report, includes a true and fair view of the development, performance and results of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.\n\nEssen, 8 March 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nS.

The Instone Group site at Erlangen is also classed as a core city (Nuremberg) as a result of its size and proximity to Nuremberg.\n\n#### Anticipated items\n\nDeferred items in the balance sheet that reflect that expenses or income incurred during the year under review do not result in income or expenditure until the following year.\n\n#### Realignment of boundaries (boundary areas)\n\nWhen realigning boundaries, scattered plots are grouped into a larger plot and surrounding plots are assigned to a central plot to increase the usability of the land.\n\n#### Asset deal\n\nIn an asset deal, the assets held in a company or just a single asset are purchased and the individual assets are transferred.\n\n#### B and C cities/add cities\n\nB cities: Major cities of national and regional importance.\n\nC cities: key German cities of regional and, to a limited extent, national importance that significantly impact the surrounding regions.\n\nThe Instone Group uses the generic term \"add cities\" for these attractive cities.\n\n#### Brownfield developments\n\nProject developments on former industrial sites and conversion areas that have been reclassified for residential utilisation and therefore do not require additional sealed surfaces. On the contrary, existing areas are upgraded or improved.\n\n#### Contractual trust arrangement (CTA)\n\nPension trust company\n\n#### Deferred compensation\n\nDeferred compensation; pension commitment within the company pension scheme – financed by a waiver of the employee's remuneration.\n\n#### Divestment\n\nRelease of restricted capital in longer-term assets by selling them.\n\n#### Duration\n\nTerm of commitment of the capital invested in fixed-income securities.\n\n#### EBIT\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes.\n\n#### EBITDA\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.\n\n{293}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIndividual sale\n\nIn an individual sale, an owner-occupied apartment only changes owners once after completion, when it is sold by the Instone Group directly to the client. Individual sales are managed either by commissioned sales agents or by the Instone Group.\n\n### Equity method\n\nAccounting method for the long-term investments of a company that participates in the voting capital of another company (the investment book value is constantly adjusted to the development of the equity of the company in which the investment has been made).\n\n#### EURIBOR\n\nAbbreviation for the reference interest rate Euro Interbank Offered Rate.\n\n#### Family offices\n\nCompanies or departments of banks managing large private assets.\n\n#### Zoning and development planning processes\n\nAccording to Section 1 (2) of the German Building Code (BauGB), a zoning plan is a preparatory urban land-use plan for part of a city, and is governed by Sections 5 et seq. BauGB. It regulates the available and probable space requirements for the individual utilisation options, such as housing, work, leisure and traffic. A development plan is a binding urban land-use plan. A development plan regulates how and what may be built on plots of land and the resulting utilisation of the areas to be left free of buildings.\n\n### FTE\n\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) is a key indicator used in staff planning. One FTE is equivalent to the time worked by one full-time employee. The standard used to convert an FTE into working hours is the average number of working hours per work day.\n\n#### Subsidised residential space\n\nHomes for rent that have been created or modernised with the provision of subsidies from state budgets or development banks and whose occupancy and rent levels have been regulated for a certain period of time (social commitment).\n\n#### Greenfield developments\n\nProject development on a previously undeveloped, non-built-up area, in other words on a \"green field\".\n\n#### GRI\n\nGRI standards constitute global best practice for public disclosures about various economic, environmental and social impacts.

Companies preparing the financial statements are also required to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard offers a single, principle-based, five-step model that can be applied to all contracts with customers.\n\n#### IFRS 16\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 \"Leases\".\n\nIFRS 16 governs the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for leases in financial statements for companies reporting in line with IFRS.

The lessor continues to distinguish between finance and operating leases for accounting purposes.\n\n### ICS\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) is a system of technical and organisational rules for methodological management and controls in the company and is designed to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent losses.\n\n{294}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Investor development\n\nProject developments for the stock owned by an investor or developments at the risk and on behalf of third parties.\n\nInvestor sales\n\nProjects are sold to investors by Instone Group key account holders.\n\n#### Capital market sales\n\nForm of selling characterised by a multi-level agency organisation.

What measures is Instone Group taking to overcome them, and why is there still cause for optimism despite everything? The Management Board discusses these questions in this interview.*\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Because we continuously monitor and analyse the economic conditions and the status of our projects at very regular intervals, our response to this situation was early and far-sighted. Regarding new investments, we have been taking an opportunistic approach since as long ago as 2022. We conducted another critical reappraisal of our cost structure and adapted it accordingly last year. In procurement, we are also benefiting from having concluded fixedprice agreements and leveraged economies of scale at an early stage. This has allowed us to secure the scheduled construction progress across all projects.\n\n#### **How would you describe the impact of the market situation on sales business?**\n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** Compared with previous years, demand for new homes was low, as expected. We were not immune to the negative effects of rising interest rates and the growing uncertainty among private and institutional investors. However, we observed a moderate upturn in demand towards the end of last year. Against all odds, we sold properties with a value of more than €211 million in 2023. In addition, the positive response to the sales launch of our new projects gives us confidence that our core business will pick up significantly this year. At the same time, we are planning our marketing activities much more actively and rigorously so that we can also withstand the industry pressures on a long-term basis.\n\n### **The ongoing crisis within the industry has hit several competitors. What challenges does this entail for a CFO?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** When a heavy storm approaches, like the one we've been going through, the first priority is to make the company even more crisis-resistant so that opportunities can be seized again afterwards. We identified the major turning point in the market at an early stage, and we made the necessary adjustments back in the middle of last year. Specifically, this meant focusing more strongly on cutting costs and securing liquidity. For instance, we met our cost-cutting targets and successfully reduced our platform costs. We deferred investments in new properties. Overall, our balance sheet has been further strengthened as a result. And this is acknowledged by our financing partners, which is why we continue to have unlimited access to capital – something that is definitely an exception at the moment.\n\n#### **Do you also see opportunities arising from the current market situation? How are you positioned to take advantage of them?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** The current industry crisis will accelerate the consolidation within the industry. The German market is highly fragmented, and it is now clearly apparent that many competitors lack such things as the financial strength to survive in the market. Along with our considerable expertise, which is reflected in factors such as our leading profitability, Instone Group has a very strong balance sheet. This puts us in a position to remain active on the property market, and we will do so again soon. Not many project developers can say that. As such, we will be able to gain further market share in the future. Our bargaining power in relation to property buyers and suppliers has improved considerably.\n\n### *\"We are in a position to remain active on the property market, and we will do so again soon. Not many project developers can say that.\"*\n\n### **David Dreyfus** CFO\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/12 description: A man in a blue suit is sitting at a table with a laptop. The text \"CFO David Dreyfus is optimistic about Instone Group's future.\" is in the lower left corner of the image.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Moreover, we are not just sitting tight on our ship and watching what the storm is doing to us. We are pursuing various strategic options for strengthening our balance sheet even further, including above and beyond our core business. Are our products solely of interest to investors and owner-occupiers? What additional strategic options can we pursue, and what business partnerships might suit Instone Group? We are intensively examining the answers to these and other questions. And I will be glad to share further details with our stakeholders as soon as we initiate tangible projects in these areas.\n\n#### **Let's turn to Instone Group's shares. The crisis within the industry has hit the share price hard. How do you see things developing next?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** As expected, Instone Group's shares were not immune to the challenging macro-environment. It goes without saying that we are not happy about this. However, in our discussions with analysts and investors, we are also hearing that Instone Group's strategy is widely supported, and that we are expected to be a major beneficiary when the market recovers. Most market players believe it is merely a matter of when and not if this happens. Ultimately, the growing shortage of housing clearly vindicates our business model. Having welcomed several prestigious institutional investors again in recent months, we are feeling positive about the future. The analysts who follow us closely also see significant upside potential, with an average target price of €10 per share.\n\n**Last year, Instone Group made a commitment to being a pioneer within the industry when it comes to sustainability. Is this still realistic in view of the current cost pressure?**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Our intentions in terms of sustainability are more than just lip service – they are now the clear benchmark for our own actions, and hence an increasingly integral aspect in all phases of our value chain. Of course, we are a business with an interest in profitability and efficiency. At the same time, we have a social and ecological responsibility as a project developer. Finding solutions to these supposedly conflicting goals is our aspiration and our obligation. In our view, sustainable action and economic efficiency are not mutually exclusive. Both aspects are becoming increasingly interdependent as the expectations of investors, municipalities and customers grow with regard to sustainability.\n\n*\"Of course, we are a business with an interest in profitability and efficiency.

What goal are you pursuing with them? What findings have already resulted from this teamwork?**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** Our ambitious sustainability goals require clearly defined steps. To ensure that we don't just address these topics theoretically and to avoid instances where implementation may be infeasible, we apply our internal expertise and collective intelligence to develop solutions. The main goal of our working groups is to conduct a holistic assessment of the lifecycle of our buildings. Each phase is critically assessed with regard to sustainability aspects – from the selection of the construction materials through the construction process to subsequent use. Every element, however small, helps us to improve the environmental footprint of our properties while creat-\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Instone Group**\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/1 description: A man in a suit and glasses is sitting at a table, pointing his finger at someone out of frame. There is a glass of water on the table in front of him. The background is a white brick wall.\n\nCOO Andreas Gräf is confident that the new brand identity will help to boost the external visibility of the company's strengths even more.\n\ning added value for the neighbourhood and society. To this end, our team of more than 30 internal experts have already obtained promising insights that we will apply in individual construction projects this year For instance, the hybrid timber working group has examined the extent to which a reduction in grey emissions (embodied carbon) is possible by replacing the structural components with timber solutions. In one specific example, calculations were made for various structures in order to compare them with regard to cost, quality and construction time savings. We are pleased that we are now putting the results into practice.\n\n**In this way, sustainability is becoming increasingly ingrained in how the company views itself. What difference is that making to the company's image?** \n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** We have adopted a clear attitude and developed expertise in the area of sustainability. What this means is we can no longer sail under the radar. In recent months, we have therefore critically analysed our brand identity, which had hardly changed since 2017, and revamped it. Our entire team is working passionately to plan and construct our residential neighbourhoods to deliver substantial added value for the community and the environment – and yet there was barely a hint of this in our corporate identity previously. By embodying our new and clearly defined brand essence, we will impress right across the board in future in terms of our identity, our image and our quality. If you've read an annual report of Instone Group before, you'll no doubt recognise our more clearly defined positioning in the layout.\n\n#### **Finally, how would you describe Instone Group's new brand personality?**\n\n**ANDREAS GRÄF** We aim to be **the** housing developer in Germany, and we have set ourselves high targets. Whatever challenges we face, we will keep on taking **bold steps.**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Thanks to the expertise of our team and our strong financial foundations, our projects and our performance are **genuinely good.**\n\n**KRUNO CREPULJA** We act transparently, seek out dialogue on continuous improvement and strive to keep our stakeholders' best interests at heart. As a result, whenever we go through a storm, we are **always together.**\n\n*\"Our entire team is working passionately to plan and construct our residential neighbourhoods to deliver substantial added value for the community and the environment.\"*\n\n**Andreas Gräf** COO\n\n**7**\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>*Leading profitability founded on a strong*\n\n# *balance sheet*\n\n*Instone Group's growth strategy has always been based on a strong balance sheet and healthy profitability as a foundation for sustainable corporate success. In the current crisis within the industry, rigorous adherence to this principle is paying off, and Instone Group remains a reliable partner for various stakeholders.*\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n> Instone Group's growth strategy has always involved one key element: a strong balance sheet with healthy profitability provides the foundations for sustainably successful business development that benefits all stakeholders. The systematic pursuit of this principle is now paying off in the current crisis within the industry. Thanks to its extremely robust financial position, Instone Group remains a reliable partner to lenders, customers, employees, suppliers, and sellers of land. We are proud to say that this has always been a part of how we view ourselves. Whereas some merely pay lip service to the concept, we ensure that our stability remains clearly visible. Downtime is an alien concept on our construction sites. Instone always finishes what it starts. *I*\n\nContinued overleaf\n\n### Three questions for David Dreyfus\n\n**You were appointed as the new CFO of the Instone Group on 1 September 2023. What were the main issues during the initial phase?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Obviously, lots of different things demand your attention whenever you start a new role. However, I was able to rely on the support of a skilled and experienced team. One major achievement was the successful placement of a new promissory note loan with a volume of €20 million in October 2023 in spite of the bad news emanating from the industry. This served to underline the position Instone Group enjoys with its financing partners even in times like these.\n\n#### **David Dreyfus** CFO\n\nDavid Dreyfus has been the CFO of Instone Real Estate Group SE since September 2023. He has more than 28 years of professional experience in corporate finance and capital market transactions thanks to his various roles, including as a partner at the consulting firm Lilja & Co. and M&A Director at Lazard.\n\n**You are keen to emphasise the remarkable strength of Instone Group's balance sheet. What form does this take?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** At the reporting date, our loan-to-cost ratio (the ratio of inventories and contract assets to financial liabilities) was just 15.1 percent. This is extremely low compared with our sector peer group. Free cash and cash equivalents amounted to €383.6 million as at 31 December 2023. The company also has unutilised credit facilities and project finance for guaranteeing project completion amounting to €304.6 million. In other words, the company enjoys a very robust financial position.\n\n**Many construction projects in Germany are coming to a standstill in the construction phase. Is this not also a risk factor for Instone Group?**\n\n**DAVID DREYFUS** Absolutely not. Our projects under construction are fully financed and already have an impressive sales level. A project volume of €2.9 billion is currently in the construction phase. 89 percent of this figure is already sold, meaning that the corresponding cash inflows are guaranteed. We completed all of our projects on schedule in 2023. As such, I am confident that Instone Group is extremely well positioned to emerge from the difficult current market situation even stronger than before.\n\nGenuinely good\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n> Among other things, our strong balance sheet is characterised by extremely low leverage and extremely high liquidity compared with our sector peer group. That is no coincidence, but rather the result of a forward-looking business policy that has always been based on the belief that a company needs to take precautions against potential downturns and ensure that it is resilient. This includes an understanding that crisis situations can give rise to particular opportunities. We intend to leverage these opportunities and make project acquisitions as soon as the market has visibly stabilised. Our liquidity situation will allow us to respond quickly once this is the case.\n\nOne of Instone Group's main strengths – and something that plays a key role in reducing its risk profile – is the extensive portfolio of projects that it has already sold. This means it can rely on considerable future cash inflows with a high degree of certainty, which serves to reinforce its financial strength.\n\nFrom a very early stage, Instone's growth strategy targeted brownfield projects in line with its sustainability focus. This involves housing development projects on spaces that are already in use or have been developed. Among other things, this prevents the need for additional surface sealing, which is more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient. Unlike many of its competitors, Instone Group is well versed in complex urban planning projects and possesses in-house expertise in the area of construction management. This outstanding project development quality within the industry is ultimately also reflected in healthy profitability that benefits all stakeholder groups. As a result, we remain able to act even in times of cost and price pressure and can absorb these adverse effects better than many of our competitors.

A lot has happened since then: The first nyoo projects have been completed and handed over to the buyers, competitions have been won and new properties have been purchased. But the origins of nyoo go back much further.*\n\nProject \"DUI 06\", Duisburg (Artist's impression from 2021/22)\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n> ack in 2015, Kruno Crepulja, CEO of the Instone Group, and current nyoo Managing Director Stefan Dahlmanns were discussing the nature of planning and construction in Germany. \"We soon agreed that substantial change was required in order to enable the planning, construction and use of residential buildings to be managed sustainably and efficiently in the future,\" says Stefan Dahlmanns. \"Complex and multifaceted processes, constantly increasing requirements and labourintensive, traditional building methods are no recipe for competitive housing construction in Germany – especially with an ongoing skills shortage.\" *B*\n\n> The fact is that continuously new prototype planning in housing construction, particularly for affordable homes, is inefficient. In view of the growing housing shortage in Germany, it is imperative to shorten project times as effectively as possible. One sensible approach is to make planning processes thoroughly standardised. This prevents every project from having to start from scratch and allows economies of scale to be leveraged.\n\n### The nyoo concept\n\nThe decision to invest strategically in standardisation and digitalisation while tapping into new markets was taken at an early stage. However, the systematic shift from individual project development to serial product development requires a focused initiative that is separate from day-to-day project business. With this in mind, nyoo was established as a standalone platform that is wholly dedicated to developing the new line of business. Since then, an interdisciplinary team has been working constantly to enhance the concept and deliver and acquire nyoo projects throughout Germany.\n\n*\"Thanks to our wide range of services covering the entire value chain, we can provide our customers with affordable housing as an a full-service package from a single source.\"*\n\n**Stefan Dahlmanns** Managing Director\n\nThe nyoo concept is based on three pillars: **product, process, production.** \n\n**Compact and scalable product** – The concept is built around the rigorous standardisation and digitalisation of planning and product. BIM-based, fully eligible for funding and compliant with building law throughout Germany, this planning module for multi-storey residential and townhouse construction forms the basis for every nyoo project. The innovative aspect is that, despite a high level of scalability, the concept has substantial variability in terms of architecture and urban planning and enables a flexible, rapid response to individual property conditions.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/14 description: A man with a beard is smiling and wearing a white shirt. He is standing outside and appears to be talking to someone, as there is a hand raised in front of him.\n\n#### **Stefan Dahlmanns**\n\nStefan Dahlmanns is the Managing Director responsible for Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. The qualified architect, real estate economist and project developer ran the North Rhine-Westphalia branch of Instone and its predecessor formart from 2013 to 2020. Before that, he worked as a partner for a large German architecture firm in Cologne. This means he has many years' experience in the development, planning and delivery of large-scale urban development and architectural design projects.\n\n**13**\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Standardised and low-interface process** – Lean construction is increasingly becoming the industry standard for modern site management. nyoo goes much further, and has shifted the entire planning and development process to a digital process map. Through its stake in beeboard GmbH, nyoo was heavily involved in developing the digital project management and communication tool that enables collaborative work within the project team. This results in a significant increase in efficiency while also ensuring process quality.\n\n### **Our three pillars: product, process and production**\n\n**Efficient and non technology-specific production** –\n\nConventional construction methods are evolving and increasingly being supplemented by elements of industrial prefabrication, as in the case of bathrooms, lift cores and balconies, for instance. This helps to reduce construction time considerably while maintaining a high level of workmanship or even improving on it. Attention is also paid to the future in areas such as production and the use of renewable raw materials. In this way, the ideal foundations are being put in place for continuously increasing the proportion of prefabrication in the years ahead.\n\n### The nyoo product is an all-round package for third parties\n\n\"As well as making our concept available to investors in the form of conventional trade development, we offer our services on third-party sites as part of a general contractor model for portfolio holders, municipal housing companies and cooperatives,\" says Stefan Dahlmanns. \"The great thing is that, thanks to our wide range of services covering the entire value chain, we can provide our customers with affordable housing as a full-service package from a single source.\"\n\nWith its innovative concept, nyoo is delivering answers to the question of how planning and construction can be made sustainable and efficient – both now and in the future.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/8 description: The image shows a modern, multi-story residential building with a white facade and dark gray balconies.

The man on the left is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt. The man on the right is wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and a brown belt. The text on the image says that the man on the left is Paul Kienlin and the man on the right is Roman Richter. The text also says that they regularly meet on site to discuss the current issues concerning Parkstadt.\n\n **ith Parkstadt, Instone is developing a new residential neighbourhood with around 600 apartments on a former hospital site comprising some 14 hectares. Why do you consider Parkstadt Leipzig to be a flagship project?** *W*\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Parkstadt was constructed in the late 19th century and is one of the most important examples of pavilion-style construction in Germany. It boasts stylish original façades and trees that are over 120 years old. Parkstadt Leipzig is a place where people can truly enjoy a high quality of life in a park environment, especially in spring and autumn when the atmosphere is awash with light.\n\n**PAUL KIENLIN** When I visited Parkstadt for the first time after joining Instone in 2019, I was struck by the size of the project, as well as the dilapidated condition of some of the existing listed buildings. I realised we would have a big task ahead of us. Today, four years later, the southern section is nearly complete and the results are more than impressive. We are seeing the emergence of a new residential neighbourhood that offers a high standard of living – a unique combination of old and new buildings that embodies the historical and the modern alike.\n\n#### **What were the challenges during the planning and construction phase?**\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Because the City of Leipzig also had a keen interest in giving Parkstadt a new lease on life, the project enjoyed particular attention right from the very beginning. For example, we held numerous coordination meetings with the city authorities while the development plan was being drawn up, which took several years.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/1 description: The image shows two buildings with red roofs, surrounded by trees.

In particular, rising interest rates meant that demand for larger and more expensive apartments declined in favour of smaller apartments, which meant that we had to make some changes to our plans. The funding landscape is also subject to continuous change, and the same is true for the statutory requirements in areas such as heating systems. It is important for us to be able to respond flexibly in order to create properties that are energy-efficient yet affordable despite these challenges.\n\n**As a company, we are confident that project development achieves the best results when we approach all tasks cooperatively and work together to resolve them. What role does this mindset play when it comes to the realisation of the Parkstadt project?**\n\n**ROMAN RICHTER** Partnership-driven cooperation and transparent communication – both internally and externally – were vital to the success of this project, too. Ultimately, all of the stakeholders have the same objective: to create apartments and neighbourhoods that offer a high standard of living. Every challenge and every milestone demanded close cooperation within our team and with the City of Leipzig.\n\n**PAUL KIENLIN** I would have to agree. For a project of this size in particular, regular dialogue is essential. Everyone across every department is on board, from the buyers, customer managers and sales staff through to the project managers and project developers. There is a lot of discussion and debate, but we always end up finding a solution that works for everyone. The same is true for coordination with the authorities. We have occasionally had to deal with differing requirements from various departments, including heritage protection, fire safety and environ-\n\n### **About the interviewees**\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/14 description: A man with a beard is smiling at the camera.

The cumulative effects of rising construction costs and the negative impacts of soaring interest rates on corporate finance and demand for housing in particular posed difficulties for many companies, in some cases putting their survival at risk. In this highly challenging environment, the Instone Group performed extremely well, meeting its financial targets for 2023 in full. This clearly reflects the strength of our platform. Adjusted revenue for 2023 totalled €616 million. A high adjusted gross profit margin of 25.1 percent again underlines our best-in-class profitability. At €48.2 million, adjusted earnings after tax actually came in at the upper end of our forecast range of €40 million to €50 million.\n\nA strong balance sheet is a key pillar of our corporate strategy. In this challenging market environment in particular, our sound financial position is beneficial in our dealings with finance providers, suppliers and customers. At the reporting date, leverage amounted to just 2.1 percent. The Instone Group holds substantial cash and cash equivalents of €383.6 million. These key figures were boosted further by the positive operating cash flow in 2023.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/19 description: A man with short brown hair and a white shirt under a dark suit jacket is smiling at the camera. The background is blurred and appears to be a brightly lit office space.\n\n### **Kruno Crepulja** Chairman of the Management Board and CEO\n\nInstone Group continues to boast an extensive portfolio of projects that have already been sold. Accordingly, these projects can be expected to generate further substantial cash inflows with a high degree of certainty. A project volume of €2.9 billion is currently in the construction phase. €2.6 billion or 89 percent of this figure is already sold.\n\nWe expect this position of strength compared to many competitors will also give to particular growth opportunities which we intend to take advantage of. We aim to gain significant market share in a highly fragmented market. Our assumption is that the crisis is not yet over and will continue during 2024. However, we are noticing a general improvement in sentiment on the part of our private and institutional customers, especially since the final quarter of 2023. The current easing of the interest rate situation is a major factor in this, although we are not yet anticipating a swift return to normal levels of demand.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n- **[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)**\n- [The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDemand for homes remains huge, and the prevailing shortage of housing in German metropolitan areas is set to intensify further over the coming years as a result of net migration and declining construction activity. With our business model, we stand to benefit from this structural demand overhang as an effective and reliable partner for our customers, suppliers and municipalities and we will position ourselves as a solution provider. This applies in particular to the affordable housing sector. With our subsidiary nyoo, we are able to build more cost-effectively than our competitors using standardised and digitalised planning in conjunction with a serial building method, meaning we can provide urgently needed affordable housing on the market. Our objective remains for the affordable housing segment to account for around half of all homes developed by the Instone Group by 2030.\n\nAs one of Germany's biggest residential developers, we are aware of our social and ecological responsibility. We reconcile economic growth with social requirements and aspects of environmental protection as a matter of principle. Our aspiration is to be pioneers of ESG within the industry. Around 30 of our employees are doing their utmost to move us even further forward on these issues in various working groups. This shows that we are actively committed to this goal rather than merely paying lip service to it. We have adopted a clear attitude and developed expertise in this area. Thanks to our more clearly defined, modern and authentic new brand positioning, our self-image is now also reflected in our revamped corporate identity.\n\nWe anticipate a moderate upturn in demand for new housing in 2024. We continue to benefit from an extensive portfolio of homes that have already been sold. On this basis, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of €500 million to €600 million and adjusted earnings after tax of €30 million to €40 million for 2024. We expect a sales volume of more than €300 million. Our platform has demonstrated its effectiveness even during the current crisis. This is down to the expertise and commitment of our entire team. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of our employees.\n\nDear shareholders, I would also like to expressly thank you for the confidence and loyalty you have placed in us.

Sharp increases in financing and construction costs have massively slowed down new building work in Germany, which is urgently needed, and continue to do so. Inflation for the year as a whole is still on average just under 6%, which has had a lasting negative impact on consumer confidence and investment decisions. In addition, ongoing or resurfaced geopolitical conflicts and economic uncertainties are further exacerbating this effect. This becomes clear, for example, when we consider the reliability of framework conditions for the funding environment of new construction projects, which is so very important for the residential real estate industry and therefore also for us.\n\nI am therefore all the more pleased that our company performed so well in this extremely challenging environment and despite all the difficulties, only some of which I have mentioned. This is thanks to Instone Group taking the right course of action early on, with both determination and focus — which is now paying off once again. Restrained acquisition, measures to further increase efficiency, such as reviewing and adapting the existing project pipeline to changing demand and funding conditions, strengthening the balance sheet — to highlight just a few of the factors behind our success.\n\nWith this in mind, our committee work during the past financial year once again mainly involved extensive and regular supervision of the Company's current situation and the Management Board's strategy. Against this\n\nbackground, I am firmly convinced, and I am speaking here for the entire Supervisory Board, that thanks to our strategic focus and the commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, which is a key element of that focus, we are very well positioned to continue to successfully overcome the challenges we will face in the future — while at the same time taking advantage of the opportunities that arise to ensure our Company's success.\n\nIn this context, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly make specific mention of last year's Management Board and Supervisory Board members. Firstly, we succeeded in filling the position of the CFO, which became vacant in the second half of the financial year, with an excellent candidate in David Dreyfus, an internationally recognised and highly experienced corporate finance and capital market specialist. Secondly, our Supervisory Board has also seen personnel and structural changes during the past financial year. By expanding the committee by one person and appointing Sabine Georgi, with our shareholders' support, we have further strengthened the Supervisory Board's profile on sustainability issues, and have also consequently continued along the path we have set of increasing the number of female members on our committee. With the appointment of Stefan Mohr as representative of our largest individual shareholder, Activum SG Capital, the composition of our committee also takes into account the current shareholder structure of the Instone Group — in line with good corporate governance.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Dr Foruhar Madjlessi for the close and trusting cooperation and the excellent work he has done during his term of office. I would also like to thank Thomas Hegel very much for his work on our Supervisory Board. He has been an important driving force on our committee since 2019.\n\nFinally, on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, our shareholders, for the confidence you once again showed in our Company over the past financial year.\n\nIn the following, we would like to inform you about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board fulfilled all the duties assigned to it by the law and the Articles of Association in the 2023 financial year.

ventur[e. GRI 2-18](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Supervisory Board committees\n\nTo streamline the work of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board had three standing committees with various responsibilities in the 2023 financial year, each of which has three members in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board: the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Other committees may be set up by the Supervisory Board as required. The committees prepare the deliberations and resolutions of the plenum in their areas of responsibility. In addition, they make decisions in the context of various tasks defined in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, insofar as the Supervisory Board has delegated these tasks to the relevant committee in the Rules of Procedure. Further information on the roles and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board committees is provided in the corporate governance statemen[t page 182.](#page-181-0)\n\n#### **Audit Committee**\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee in the year under review were Dr Jochen Scharpe (Chair), Stefan Brendgen, Thomas Hegel (up to the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023) and Stefan Mohr (since 14 June 2023). The Audit Committee held eight meetings during the year under review. No written resolutions were passed.\n\nThe topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the period under review included the internal audit personnel, the recommendation to the full Supervisory Board to approve the plan and the budget for 2023 and to approve or accept the consolidated and annual financial statements 2022, the proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2022 financial year, the recommendation for the proposed auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, the existing finance structure at Company and project level, the Company's obligations under existing financial contracts, the audit plan and the main focal points for the auditor and the awarding of the audit contract, the fast close\n\nprocess for the quarterly and six-monthly financial reports and the initial draft for the corporate plan and the budget for the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe Audit Committee also held an intensive discussion over several meetings on the current structure of the Instone Group internal control system and its future development. During the calendar year, the committee also looked at the work by the Company's internal audit team, including in particular the annual audit report 2022/2023 and the personnel resources of the internal audit team. Finally, the Audit Committee looked in detail at the risk management system and the risk reporting system.\n\nIn the past financial year, the Chair of the Audit Committee also made regular use of the opportunity to obtain information directly from the heads of the central divisions of the Company on selected topics.\n\n#### **Nomination Committee**\n\nThe members of the Nomination Committee during the year under review were Thomas Hegel (Chair and committee member until the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023), Stefan Brendgen (Chair since 14 June 2023), Dr Jochen Scharpe (until the end of the Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023), Christiane Jansen and Stefan Mohr (since 14 June 2023). The Nomination Committee did not hold any meetings during the year under review. It passed one written resolution.\n\nThe subject of the resolution passed in writing by the Nomination Committee was the proposal to the full Supervisory Board for the election of the members of the Supervisory Board by the 2022 Annual General Meeting and the process for the search for another female member of the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Remuneration Committee**\n\nThe members of the Remuneration Committee in the 2023 financial year were Dietmar P. Binkowska (Chair), Stefan Brendgen and Dr Jochen Scharpe. The Remuneration Committee held a total of three meetings in the year under review. The committee did not pass any written resolutions during the year under review.\n\nAt its meetings, the Remuneration Committee discussed in particular the recommendations to the full Supervisory Board for setting the\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n**[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)**\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nManagement Board remuneration for 2022, the recommendations to the full Supervisory Board for setting the targets for the variable Management Board remuneration, the remuneration report for the 2022 financial year and the status of target achievement for the short-term variable remuneration for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Trusting cooperation between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the context of the topics outlined above and other matters, the Supervisory Board carefully and regularly monitored the management of the Company by the Management Board and supported it on the strategic development of the Company and key decisions. The same applies to the committees of the Supervisory Board within the scope of their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nOnce again in the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board discussed strategic matters with the Management Board in addition to and outside its meetings. In the past year, the focal points included the strategic development of the existing business and the macro-economic environment, the continued development of the Instone Group in terms of ESG and digitalisation, and the development of the share price.\n\nThe Management Board informed the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively about any and all aspects that were material to the Company, and fulfilled its reporting duties as specified by law, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure. Above all, these included the business development of the Instone Group, sales activities, construction cost developments, the development of the share price and fundamental matters concerning corporate planning, strategy and organisation. The Management Board also reported extensively to the Supervisory Board on the business performance of the Instone Group in conference calls that took place in addition to Supervisory Board meetings in connection with the publication of the quarterly statements and the half-yearly financial report. Even outside meetings, the Chairman of the Management Board in particular had intensive and regular exchanges, especially with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nBusiness and transactions requiring the consent of the Supervisory Board under the Articles of Association or Rules of Procedure of the Management Board were submitted to the Supervisory Board by the Management Board for resolution by the Supervisory Board and were discussed in detail with the Supervisory Board in advance of said resolution. In the past financial year, this included in particular the matter of increasing the strategic holding in beeboard GmbH.\n\n#### Corporate governance and declaration of conformity\n\nBoth the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are committed to the principles of good corporate governance in accordance with the recommendations of the German Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code. In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board therefore again extensively and repeatedly dealt with corporate governance matters.\n\nThis included, for example, filling the position of CFO following the resignation of Dr Foruhar Madjlessi from the Management Board, the search for candidates and proposals for filling two seats on the Supervisory Board, the target for the number of female members of the Supervisory Board, Management Board remuneration and the skills profile and qualification matrix for members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn December 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE issued a joint declaration of conformity with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with the provisions of Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act after in-depth deliberations. It is included in the annual report 2023 o[n page 182 a](#page-181-0)nd can also be found on the Company's ä [website](http://www.instone-group.de/en) in the Investor Relations section under Instone Group Compliance Statement.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board also report in detail on the corporate governance of Instone Real Estate Group SE in the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f, 315d of the German Commercial Code, which can be found o[n page 182 o](#page-181-0)f this annual report. The corporate governance statement can also be found on the Company's ä [website in](http://www.instone-group.de/en) the Investor Relations section.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the GCGC, the Supervisory Board also informs the Annual General Meeting of conflicts of interest among members of the Supervisory Board. No such conflicts of interest were disclosed to or identified by the Supervisory Board during the entire period under review.\n\nThe Company supports the members of the Supervisory Board in taking advantage of training and further education options on Supervisory Board-specific topics, for instance by bearing the required costs of such training.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n**[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)**\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Personnel changes in the Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThere were changes in personnel in both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\nDr Foruhar Madjlessi left the Management Board with effect from 31 August 2023 after his Management Board mandate was ended by mutual agreement. The Supervisory Board filled the resulting vacant position of CFO with the appointment of David Dreyfus. He was appointed a member of the Management Board with effect from 1 September 2023 to 31 December 2027.\n\nAt the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting on 14 June 2023, Thomas Hegel left the Company's Supervisory Board after resigning his mandate prematurely with effect from that date. Stefan Mohr was elected as the new member of the Supervisory Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting until the Annual General Meeting which will be convened to approve the Company's activities for the 2025 financial year. Sabine Georgi is also a new member of the Supervisory Board. She was elected to the Supervisory Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting for the same period and will therefore fill the sixth seat on the Supervisory Board which was also newly created by the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n#### Audit of annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Dusseldorf, was elected as auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year by the Annual General Meeting of the Company and commissioned by the Supervisory Board. The focal points of the audit were discussed in detail with the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting on 12 September 2023 and established accordingly.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted in the European Union and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code.\n\nThe auditor provided its report and the documentation relating to the financial statements for the 2023 financial year to the members of the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board on 11 March 2024.\n\nThe report was discussed in detail at the Audit Committee meeting and the financial statements review meeting held by the plenary Supervisory Board on 11 March 2024. The auditor was present at both meetings. The auditor provided detailed reports on the main findings of the audit at the meetings and answered all the questions posed by members of the Audit Committee and the plenum. In addition, the auditor provided information about services provided by it in addition to the auditing services. There was no evidence of bias on the part of the auditor.\n\nThe auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023 and the combined management report on 11 March 2024. Following a detailed review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report as at 31 December 2023 by the Audit Committee, the latter recommended its approval to the plenum. Per the final result of its own review, no objections were raised by the Supervisory Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Management Board. The annual financial statements have therefore been adopted. The Supervisory Board has reviewed and carefully considered the proposal put forward by the Management Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting for the appropriation of the net profit for the 2023 financial year and agrees with this proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the members of the Management Board and all employees of the Instone Group for their outstanding commitment and excellent performance in the past financial year.\n\nEssen, 11 March 2024\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nStefan Brendgen\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n### **EQUITY STORY**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n#### **Equity story**\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/16 description: The image contains a blue icon of a city skyline next to the words \"Benefiting high density German\".\n\n**Benefiting greatly from the high demand for housing in German cities:** \n\nAs one of Germany's leading residential real estate developers, the Instone Group is benefiting in the medium-term from stable growing demand for housing coupled with low availability of housing, particularly in metropolitan areas.\n\nThe Instone Group is one of the few developers established Germany-wide that focuses on attractive locations in the country's key metropolitan areas and their catchment areas. One key competitive factor is the Group's extensive expertise along the entire value chain, which spans site acquisition and development, planning and construction management, and the sale of the residential units. This comprehensive expertise is also reflected in a sector-leading gross margin of around 25%, which is sustainable even in the face of a slump in current markets and cost inflation. Among other things, this also gives the Instone Group flexibility in terms of pricing.\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/20 description: The image shows a blue icon of a square with rounded corners. Inside the square is a line drawing of a house with a slanted roof and a door. A pencil is positioned diagonally across the house, as if drawing or editing it. To the right of the icon are the words \"Inn\" stacked on top of \"ext\".\n\n**Innovative nyoo promises extra growth potential:**\n\nThe innovative product nyoo for affordable housing gives the Instone Group a clear edge over the competition and considerable potential for growth. After several years of development, the company has managed to significantly reduce planning and construction costs by intelligently standardising the planning process and streamlining the production process. The digitalisation of the planning process and creation of a highly scalable product are key factors to this success. This product is also predestined for the growth field of subsidised housing construction. The expansion of the nyoo business is a key pillar of the medium-term growth strategy, with the annual revenue share of the affordable housing product segment expected to increase to at least 50% by 2030.\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/23 description: The image shows a blue icon of a euro bill with a padlock on top of it. The icon is inside a rounded square with a white background.\n\n**High cash flow security as a result of projects under construction that already have a buyer:**\n\nThe project portfolio secured as at 31 December 2023 with an expected volume of sales contracts of €7.0 billion provides a high level of visibility for the future.\n\nOf this €7.0 billion, projects accounting for around €2.9 billion of revenue are already in the construction phase. Of these, housing accounting for around €2.6 billion of revenue, or around 89%, had already been sold as of 31 December 2023. This makes expected future revenues and cash flows highly secure and therefore strongly protects against risk, especially as the market currently experiences a period of slowdown.\n\nThe Instone Group expects the projects already under construction to generate high, largely hedged operating cash flow over the next three years, which can be used to consolidate the balance sheet, invest in future growth and pay attractive dividends.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n**[Equity story](#page-29-0)**\n\n[Shares](#page-31-0)\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/15 description: The image shows a blue icon of a magnifying glass over a bar graph. The magnifying glass is on the left side of the image, and the bar graph is on the right side of the image. The icon is enclosed in a rounded square.\n\n**Strong balance sheet secures defensive risk profile and underpins medium-term growth:**\n\nThe Instone Group has a healthy balance sheet, which was further strengthened in 2023. This gives it a clear competitive advantage, especially given the current climate in the sector. The low debt ratio as at the reporting date is reflected in the leverage ratio of 2.1 (net financial liabilities/EBITDA) and a loan-to-costratio of 15.1%. In addition, the company has €383.6 million of liquidity as at 31 December 2023. This gives the Instone Group sufficient financial leeway to pursue project acquisition opportunities in the coming year.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/18 description: The image shows a blue icon of a hand holding three people, next to the words \"Clear responsibilities\" in blue.\n\n**Clear commitment to social responsibility:** \n\nSustainability is a mainstay of our corporate strategy. The Instone Group supports EU and German federal government climate targets and aims to achieve CO2 neutrality by 2045. Overall, our aim is to be a sustainability pioneer in the sector. In 2023, the ESG rating agency Sustainalytics again ranked the Instone Group among the top 3% of global real estate developers.

Following a strong performance in the final quarter, the DAX recorded a total increase of 20.3%. It also achieved a new record high in December.\n\nThe markets were heavily influenced by the development of inflation and interest rates. The restrictive monetary policy adopted by international central banks as a result of the sudden increase in inflation led to ten consecutive increases in interest rates by the European Central Bank up to September 2023. Falling inflation then gave hope to market participants in the fourth quarter that interest rates had peaked and a relaxation of interest rate levels would follow. This was also the material driver behind the strong share price performance in the final quarter.\n\nOther material factors that affected the share price included the negative news in March from the financial sector in the USA and in Europe, though ultimately this news was managed. Geopolitical tension together with the resulting negative economic implications continued to weigh heavily on the markets in 2023. One of the major factors in this respect was the fear of a potential escalation of the Middle East conflict in Israel, which temporarily placed the markets under pressure in October but was followed by a strong recovery by the end of the year.\n\nAs the sector is sensitive to interest rates, there was a particular focus on real estate shares in discussions about interest rate developments. Faced with a high degree of fluctuation in share prices during the year, the benchmark index of German real estate shares EPRA/NAREIT Germany ultimately recorded a positive performance in 2023 of 27.7%, which means that it actually outshone the performance of the main DAX index.\n\nIn addition to the macro factors described above, the Instone Group share performance was also influenced by a number of negative news stories from the German residential developers sector, including major company insolvencies. Higher interest rates, which mainly subdues demand, but also has a negative effect on costs, combined with higher construction costs placed many of our competitors under severe pressure in 2023. Against this backdrop, Instone Group shares recorded a negative share price performance of 9.5% with a final Xetra price of €7.30. Shareholders received a dividend of €0.35 per share, which at the time of the ex-dividend date following the 2023 Annual General Meeting represented a dividend yield of 6.4%. This meant that overall Instone Group shares delivered only a slightly negative return over the full year of 2023. The share price reached a high of €9.62 on 2 February 2023 (source: Xetra closing price) and a low of €4.99 on 2 June 2023. The Instone Group market capitalisation at the end of the year was €343 million (previous year: €379 million).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Letter to shareholders](#page-19-0)\n\n[The Management Board](#page-21-0)\n\n[Supervisory Board report](#page-23-0)\n\n[Equity story](#page-29-0)\n\n**[Shares](#page-31-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Share price performance from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023**\n\nIndexed, 31/12/2022 = 100% Historical prices (Xetra closing prices)\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/17 description: The image is a line graph comparing the performance of three different indices over time.

Its shares are listed on Deutsche Börse's Prime Standard index. The Instone Group develops residential buildings and apartment complexes and additionally operates in the publicly subsidised residential construction sector. It also works on contemporary urban planning and the refurbishment of listed buildings. These are marketed to owner-occupiers, retail buy-to-let investors and institutional investors. The Company has 441 employees across nine locations in Germany. As at 31 December 2023, the project portfolio of the Instone Group included 45 development projects with an anticipated gross development value of approximately €7.0 billion and 14,252 unit[s. GRI 2-7](#page-286-0) \n\nAround 87.6% of the development portfolio (based on the expected sales volume after completion of the development) is traditionally focused on the most important metropolitan regions of Germany (Berlin, Cologne/Bonn, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt/Main, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich, Nuremberg and\n\nStuttgart. Around 12.4% of the projects are located in other prospering medium-sized cities. Well-connected suburbs and medium-sized cities in the metropolitan regions are becoming increasingly attractive and can thus help to meet the generally high demand for residential space.\n\nIn addition to its traditional core product – i.e. the individually planned and tailored development of homes for rental and homes for sale – the Instone Group also develops affordable newly built housing in the outskirts of metropolitan areas and in well-connected B- and C-tier cities under the brand name nyoo. In line with the Instone Group's strategy, the nyoo brand shall be developed into a key driver of medium-term growth for the company. With the help of Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, about half of all properties developed by the Instone Group will come from the \"affordable housing\" segment (see also the \"Strategy\" section on [page 42\\) a](#page-41-0)s early as 2030.\n\n#### **Coverage of the entire value chain**\n\nThe Instone Group is the only listed developer in Germany that exclusively focuses on residential real estate and also covers the entire value chain, figure 001. We offer a fully integrated platform across Germany that covers land acquisition, land development, concept planning and construction management through to marketing and sales.

In addition, the headquarters of the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, with currently 47 employees, is located in Cologne.\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/17 description: The image shows a map of Germany with several cities marked with a location pin. The cities marked are Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Essen, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Munich.\n\nWith regard to corporate management, the Instone Group implements an integrated risk management system and uses reporting and planning tools to minimise risk in the development process. As per German Broker and Developer Regulations (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung, MaBV), the company has the option of contractually agreeing to instalment payments based on the progress of construction for residential units sold to owner-occupiers or private investors, for example. Comparable financing arrangements are also frequently negotiated with institutional investors in this regard. This significantly reduces both the financing risk and the capital commitment for the Instone Group. Instone Real Estate Group SE acts as a strategic management holding company; the subsidiary Instone Real Estate Development GmbH is responsible for the operational project business with the traditional core product. The company Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, founded in 2019, is responsible for business concerning the new product of affordable housin[g. figure 002](#page-37-0)\n\n#### **Slight decrease in number of employees**\n\nAs part of the current crisis in the sector, we have increasingly focused on our costs and reduced our platform costs. This coincided with a decrease in the number of employees. On 31 December, 2023, the Instone Group employed a total of 441 people.

The market environment in the real estate sector has changed considerably. This is due to heavily rising inflation, which has also led to a substantial increase in building costs and, in particular, a markedly more restrictive monetary policy as a result of inflationary trends. Ultimately, the interest hikes implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) have also led to a historic rise in the ten-year mortgage rates in Germany. These rose from a very low level of less than 1.0% in 2021 to around 4.2% in autumn 2023. This had a significantly negative impact on demand from both private and institutional investors.\n\nDeclining demand for new housing has also already had a negative impact on supply. An expected decline in building completion rates will therefore further exacerbate the excess structural demand on the German residential property market, especially in light of the refugee crisis which has led to an additional increase in demand. On the other hand, the decline in construction activity has led to a certain easing of building costs, which have stabilised in the second half of 2023.\n\n#### **Competitive environment**\n\nIn a fragmented competitive environment, the Instone Group considers itself to be in a leading market position. There are few other project developers that operate across all of Germany and are therefore able to compete nationwide in the purchase of development projects. The competitive situation is instead characterised by smaller, more regional or local project developers.\n\nEspecially in the current industry crisis, which has led to more real estate developers facing insolvency, the Instone Group benefits from its financial strength, which is evident in its very low leverage ratio and high liquidity. This is a key distinguishing factor, especially in a competitive environment characterised by numerous regional providers with limited financial resources. In a difficult financing environment, the Instone Group continues to enjoy unrestricted access to new sources of financing, as confirmed by the issue of a new promissory note loan in the final quarter, for example. We believe that our financial strength is one of the important selling points for our customers and subcontractors, and enables us to capitalise on project acquisition opportunities as soon as the market stabilises.\n\nFurther information on the development of the German residential real estate market over the past financial year can be found in the \"Economic framework\" section starting o[n page 129.](#page-128-0) \n\n#### **Political and regulatory framework**\n\nReal estate development is affected by a number of factors, including the political environment, the regulatory framework and general public acceptance. The housing market has increasingly been the focus of political debate and public discussion in recent years. This is due primarily to the persistently high level of demand for housing driven by demographic change and migration both into Germany and in particular within Germany. Given the relatively low level of new construction activity, these factors are leading to a sustained shortage of housing in the metropolitan areas.\n\nWe believe that the Instone Group has a joint responsibility alongside policy-makers and local authorities to focus on finding solutions to this excess demand, and the main way we can play our part is by creating housing that is both liveable and affordable. The Instone Group is closely and continuously monitoring the shifting regulatory framework and aligning its business activities with the new legislation. We are engaging in a close dialogue with state and local authorities to actively help improve the framework for the creation of housing. To achieve this objective, Management Board Chair Kruno Crepulja is, for instance, Vice Chair of the Residential Real Estate Committee for ZIA Zentraler Immobilien Ausschuss e. V. (German Property Federation), the umbrella organisation of the real estate industry in Germany.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWhen considering the regulatory environment, it is also important to note that it is the balancing of residents' individual interests and the common good within re-densification projects for markets with housing shortages that is increasingly leading to project delays or cancellations. The growing importance of environmental concerns also further complicates the procurement of planning permission. Nevertheless, it is worth noting at present that most Instone Group projects are supported by the public. In our view, this is underpinned by active and transparent communication and high levels of credibility. In development planning processes, the Instone Group maintains open communications and involves all affected stakeholders, such as neighbours and interested citizens, in the planning of the neighbourhoods at an early stage, which results in comparatively few conflicts and minimal associated public law proceedings.\n\nThe Instone Group itself meets its obligations under urban development contracts with local authorities as an integral part of the value chain. Our current projects include the creation of crèche places for 1,759 children and affordable housing in locations with major shortages, amounting to 2,610 subsidised homes or 84 reduced-price homes.\n\nSignificant changes currently affecting the regulatory environment or uncertainty factors that could affect the Instone Group's business model are described below.\n\n#### **Federal government subsidy policy**\n\nGermany's current coalition government has described the creation of new housing to be a key political goal and has established a separate Federal Ministry of Construction for this purpose. The main objective is the construction of 400,000 new units per year, 100,000 of which will be publicly subsidised. However, the number of newly constructed units continued to fall well short of this target in 2023 and even building completion rates are in decline. This is due to poorer overall conditions coupled with rapidly rising loan interest rates and building costs and general macroeconomic risks, in addition to ongoing uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework.\n\nNew subsidies for climate-friendly new builds and the creation of residential property worth €1.1 billion have been launched for 2023. This is a comparatively low volume. Around €350 million of this has been made available to help families own a home (\"Residential Property for Families\", or \"Wohneigentum für Familien\" programme), which was intended to replace the government's Baukindergeld grant programme, which\n\nexpired in late 2022. The new programme will only provide funding for new buildings in Germany intended for owner occupancy that meet the Efficiency House 40 Plus (EH 40) standard. Families with at least one under-age child and a maximum annual taxable household income of €60,000 were eligible to apply. This income limit was raised to €90,000 on 16 October 2023. This limit increases by €10,000 for each additional under-age child. However, families that have already received federal funding for residential property in the past, such as through the former grant scheme, are ineligible. The subsidy system is based on the granting of low-interest KfW loans, which, however, can be used as a replacement for equity. Depending on the number of children and proof of a Sustainable Building Quality (QNG) seal, the maximum subsidy was between €170,000 and €270,000.\n\nAround €750 million was also earmarked to subsidise the construction of new climate-friendly rentals under the \"Climate-friendly new housing\" programme. This programme was aimed at housing groups and cooperatives as well as private developers. To receive funding, the building had to meet the Efficiency House 40 (EH 40) standard and may not use fossil fuels to generate heat. Additional funding was possible by obtaining a QNG certificate for sustainable buildings. This subsidy was also based on the granting of low-interest loans. The programme was terminated early in December 2023 as the funding was used up. The maximum subsidy per unit was €100,000–€150,000.\n\nThe federal government also enacted tax relief for property owners on 1 January 2023. The linear depreciation rate for leased residential building construction is slated to be increased from 2% to 3%, thus shortening the depreciation period from 50 to 33 years. This should help support a campaign of climate-friendly new construction. For a limited time, a special depreciation allowance shall also be put in place under which 5% of manufacturing costs can be deducted as depreciation within four years. These costs are limited to €4,800 per square metre, of which no more than €2,500 per square metre can be claimed for tax purposes. This tax benefit requires the building to meet the Efficiency House 40 standard and have a QNG seal.\n\nAs part of its planned introduction of the new Growth Opportunities Act, the federal government's plans included subsidising new construction by introducing a declining annual depreciation rate of 6% and thus increasing the linear depreciation rate of 3% introduced on 1 January 2023, on 1 October 2023. Federal Council approval, which is required to introduce the act, had not been given by the balance sheet date.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **German Building Land Mobilisation Act implemented at federal state level**\n\nThe Building Land Mobilisation Act, which came into force in mid-2021, has since been implemented to varying degrees in the individual federal states. While Baden-Württemberg, for example, primarily introduced a municipal pre-emptive right to undeveloped land in certain municipalities, Hamburg and Berlin also decided to reserve the right to approve conversion of rental apartments into private property (Section 250 of the German Building Code (BauGB)).\n\nIn the real estate sector, the Building Land Mobilisation Act is seen as a drastic market intervention and encroachment on property rights, which is expected to result in a long-term reduction in supply for purchasers of owner-occupied housing. Thanks to the municipal pre-emptive right, local authorities have more opportunities to gain preferential access to land and housing and to build houses there themselves. The growing use of municipal pre-emptive rights can therefore also influence the acquisition activities of private developers. The generally limited financial flexibility for many local authorities significantly limits their acquisition potential.\n\nHowever, the Instone Group also believes that additional opportunities may emerge through public sector collaborations if pre-emptive purchase rights are exercised more frequently.\n\n#### **Municipal land regulations**\n\nIn recent years, political efforts have been made in a number of the Instone Group's core markets to further extend regulations as part of the creation of new planning permissions. As well as increases in mandatory quotas for the creation of subsidised housing, there are also initiatives to regulate privately financed residential construction more heavily at local authority level, for example by using fixed quotas for homes for sale, homes for rent, reduced-rent housing or cooperative housing.\n\nWhile additional regulations of this type are likely to have negative effects on both the demand for and supply of building land in general, the Instone Group believes it is well positioned to compete in this environment thanks to the development of a product for affordable housing. With our expertise in products and implementation in the area of low-cost construction, our assessment is that we are further strengthening our relative competitive position compared to other developers. Furthermore, current projects with planning permission and projects for which the process of procuring planning permission has already started are not affected by these requirements.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n### **Strateg**\n\nImage /page/41/Figure/9 description: The image shows a combined management report with a list of topics on the left and a diagram on the right.

With nyoo, we are also addressing B- and C-tier locations in the vicinity of economic hubs, which are becoming increasingly attractive. With our projects, we also constantly focus on sustainable, climate-friendly neighbourhood development and the incorporation of social aspects, including the provision of subsidised housing and housing with improved accessibility. Neighbourhood developments consist of a mix of residential units supplemented by other usage categories, such as offices, commercial spaces and community facilities, for example child day-care centres. For a larger proportion of non-residential developments, we take on land development and typically include project partners for the commercial part. With regard to the project sizes, we concentrate on large projects with an average value of around €100 million with our traditional product. In contrast, the average project size for nyoo is around €30–50 million.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Growth driver nyoo for affordable housing\n\nWith our product to create affordable housing, nyoo, we are supplementing our current product range with high-quality, low-cost housing based on modular planning. By combining modular planning, serial construction and streamlined products, we are planning to significantly reduce production costs and project durations. The cost advantages achieved with this product allow the Instone Group to develop a market in the mid-price segment with high growth potential, allowing us to meet the high demand for housing from middle income groups while also making a valuable contribution to providing affordable housing near metropolitan areas as well as in B-tier and C-tier cities, which we consider to be attractive. By 2030, around half of our developed homes will be in the affordable housing category.\n\n#### Project pipeline expansion\n\nThe acquisition of suitable land is essential if the Instone Group is to grow as planned. As early as the 2022 financial year, we significantly scaled back our acquisitions as the market began to experience a downturn, and ultimately abstained from any new project acquisitions in 2023, thus shifting our short-term focus to strengthening the balance sheet. However, we assume that we will be able to benefit from opportunities for land acquisition or projects already at an advanced stage in the current environment in 2024. We plan to resume acquisitions as soon as demand stabilises further. In the medium-term, we plan to again expand our project portfolio in terms of both traditional business and our product for affordable housing, nyoo. The strong key balance sheet figures in the view of the Management Board also lead us to believe that the Instone Group is well positioned to achieve further growth.\n\n#### Making the most of competitive advantages along the value chain\n\nAs one of the few developers in Germany focusing on residential real estate, the Instone Group has many years of extensive expertise along the entire value chain:\n\n- → When acquiring land, we prioritise \"off-market transactions\", i.e. acquisitions outside the multi-stage public bidding process. Establishing networks over the long-term represents an important success factor in opening up attractive buying opportunities.\n- → When making acquisitions, we prioritise land that has no planning permission in order to harness the increased potential for added value. The Instone Group brings its experience to acquiring economically attractive planning permission.\n- → The Group helps local authorities to acquire planning permission, in particular by developing urban planning strategies and proposals for action, and to draft land use and development plans.\n- → In the vast majority of cases, we act as our own general contractor. Contracts are individually awarded to regional and national construction companies from our existing network based on relevant selection criteria. These criteria include the company's experience with comparable projects, the technical requirements and the level of quality required.\n- → Direct access to subcontractors gives us a competitive advantage, especially when contractors are working at near-full capacity. This makes it possible to ensure building capacity early on and to provide a high level of cost transparency. The value created internally has a positive overall effect on our operating margin.\n- → In marketing and sales, we maximise our access to all relevant target groups, such as owner-occupiers, capital investors and institutional investors.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Exploiting efficiency gains through digitalisation\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nFor the Instone Group, greater digitalisation of business processes is a critical factor in further increasing efficiency and a key competitive advantage in a highly fragmented industry with relatively little digitalisation. By continuously digitalising and analysing all of our processes, we can routinely identify potential areas for improvement and thus make our planning and construction processes more efficient in the long-term. As a result, we are working on the uniform digitalisation of our entire process landscape with proprietary software, allowing us to create an integrated planning and construction process that can make the best use of the opportunities presented by serial construction.\n\n#### Leading the way in sustainability\n\nFair and responsible action with regard to economic, environmental and social sustainability is a core component of the Instone Group strategy. We firmly believe that our company's sustainability performance is crucial to our long-term economic success and competitiveness. The fact that we are taking a pioneering role in this is confirmed by specialised sustainability rating agency, Sustainalytics. In its 2023 analysis, it ranked the Instone Group among the top 3% of real estate developers of a total of 288 companies studied worldwide. One way in which we managed to further implement our strategy in the past financial year was by establishing in-house impact groups of around 30 employees each. These groups work intensively on the operational implementation and integration of sustainable materials, neighbourhood infrastructure and important social aspects in our neighbourhoods, for example[.

This is an important success component for further strengthening the Instone Group's competitive position.\n\nIts internal corporate management is, in particular, based on the following elements:\n\n- → Integrated management information system\n- → Database-supported project management\n- → Structured meeting system\n- → Financial and real estate business key performance indicators\n- → Group-wide risk management\n\n#### Integrated management information system\n\nThe integrated management information system (MIS) supports all management levels during planning and decision-making processes. One material element is our \"bottom-up\" business planning which views the specific factors influencing property from a financial perspective.\n\nThe reporting system for the presentation of key developments relating to the real estate and financial key performance indicators is compiled on a monthly basis, supplemented by a consideration of the key project milestones and the development of liquidity.\n\n#### Database-supported project management\n\nWithin the scope of its project management, the Instone Group relies on a database-supported planning and reporting system that is integrated into the wider system landscape. This supports the individual process steps for the monthly preparation of project forecasts and updates. It also serves as a central database for both operational level and higher-level corporate controlling. This makes it possible to identify potential and the need for action resulting from the updated project forecasts at an early stage with the support of tools.\n\n#### Structured meeting system\n\nThe targeted exchange of information from the project teams up to Management Board level is an integral part of the Instone Group's corporate management system. These include, among other things, the monthly project team and results meetings in the branches as well as the discussions with the Management Board regarding the status of the projects.\n\n→ Group-wide risk management\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Corporate governance key performance indicators**\n\n#### **Financial and real estate business key performance indicators**\n\n#### Important corporate governance key performance indicators\n\nFor governance of our sustainable economic success, we use the profitbased key performance indicators (KPIs) of adjusted revenue, adjusted gross profit margin and adjusted earnings after tax (EAT) as financial performance indicators and the real estate business key performance indicator of volume of sales contracts as a non-financial performance indicator.\n\n#### **Adjusted revenue**\n\nThe key indicator for the performance of the Instone Group is adjusted revenue. Thanks to the application of period-based revenue recognition in almost all project developments in the Instone Group, adjusted revenues represent a key indicator for assessing the performance of the Company which is sufficient in our view. The adjusted revenue recognition similarly includes share deals and asset deals in analogous application of IFRS 15 in the determination, regardless of the decision of IFRS IC to exclude share deals from the revenue recognition over time under IFRS 15. In addition, adjusted revenue recognition is calculated without the effects from purchase price allocations.\n\n#### **Adjusted gross profit margin**\n\nAdjusted gross profit is determined from the adjusted revenue less cost of materials, changes in inventories, material-costs related other operating income, indirect sales costs and capitalised interest, but without considering the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals. The adjusted gross profit margin as a ratio of adjusted gross profit to adjusted revenues reflects the operating result after deducting all external costs that can be directly attributed to the project and places the focus on the projects' profitability.\n\n#### **Adjusted earnings after tax**\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax is calculated on the basis of adjusted gross profit less platform costs, consisting of staff costs, other operating income and expenses, depreciation and amortisation, investment and other income, financial result and income taxes, but is also adjusted for the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals, as well as any non-recurring effects, where applicable.\n\nIn particular, the following significant expenses are adjusted for disposal losses from sales of tangible or financial assets or securities, unscheduled depreciation and amortisation of tangible and financial assets, one-off expenses relating to the valuation of inventories, costs for acquisitions, merger losses, contractual penalties, demands for additional taxes from previous years based on audits, severance payments to the Management Board, and personnel reductions and restructuring to a greater extent, if these do not meet the strict criteria set out in IAS 37. The adjustment of material income includes, in particular, income from capital gains arising from sales of non-current assets, compensation for damages, writeups on non-current assets, refunds of taxes from previous years based on audits, reversals of provisions for extraordinary events and merger gains.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **[Our company](#page-1-0) [To our shareholders](#page-18-0) Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)**\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Volume of sales contracts**\n\nVolume of sales contracts reflects the revenue-relevant (adjusted) volume of contracts of our projects. It mainly comprises all sales-related transactions, such as notarised real estate purchase agreements, individual orders from clients and rental income.\n\nVolume of sales contracts is also referred to as sales volume.\n\n#### Other important key performance indicators\n\nThe management of the Instone Group also uses the following KPIs for analysis and reporting:\n\n#### **Current offer for sale**\n\nThe current offer for sale is calculated on the basis of the unsold residential units in projects where sales have already started.\n\n#### **Project portfolio**\n\nThe project portfolio value as at the reporting date is the anticipated overall volume of revenue from all projects listed in the portfolio. The Instone Group divides its project portfolio into three different groups depending on the stage of development: For projects with the status \"presale\", the land has already been purchased, secured or claimed by us in a binding offer, but marketing has not yet begun. Following sales release and the initiation of marketing, projects are transferred to a \"pre-construction\" status. Projects with a completed start of construction have an \"under construction\" status until complete handover. Once structural obligations have been met and the entire sale<sup>1</sup> and full handover are complete, projects are removed from the project portfolio in the next reporting month.\n\n#### **Volume of new approvals**\n\nThe volume of new approvals reflects the Instone Group's success in acquiring new land and development projects. To secure the prospective cash outflows resulting from the approved investment, the project is included in our project portfolio from the date of approval. The internal approvals linked to the volume of new approvals are based on secured land access rights or such rights that have been verified by us with an offer involving a firm commitment. The volume of new approvals is measured by the volume of sales contracts expected at the time the new approval is granted.\n\n#### **Project gross profit and project gross profit margin**\n\nThe project gross profit consists of the project proceeds included in the adjusted revenue in the income statement over the project term, reduced by the relevant external project costs.\n\nThe relationship between the project gross profit and the total revenue proceeds of the project is used to calculate the project gross profit margin.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **Sustainability report**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Sustainability report (unaudited)**\n\n### **General principles and [requ](#page-286-0)irements** GRI 2-5\n\n#### Applied reporting standards\n\nIn this year's Sustainability Report, Instone Real Estate Group SE is voluntarily complying with the provisions of commercial law concerning non-financial reporting in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), although the Instone Group is not obliged to do so under the terms of the HGB because of the size of the Company. Additionally, this report discloses more than the minimum information required by law and is guided by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as well as their modified understanding of double materiality. This directive and these standards will become mandatory for the Instone Group for reporting starting in the financial year 2025. Since the Instone Group considers these developments to be important and instructive, it has aligned itself with these now-final European requirements, as it did in the previous year's report.\n\nAll sections of the text, tables and figures in the sustainability report which form part of the non-financial statement under the terms of the HGB and therefore are subject to a voluntary audit with limited assurance are indicated with the symbol .\n\nIn the context of the identification of key topics that are reported, the HGB and CSRD or ESRS (as of: 31 July 2023) differ with respect to their definition of double materiality.\n\nDouble materiality primarily consists of:\n\n1. Sustainability topics that are material to the performance, results and position of the business,\n\nand\n\n2. Effects of the business activities that have a material impact on the Company's environment.\n\nIn accordance with Section 289c (3) HGB, topics that are simultaneously material from both perspectives must be taken into consideration, while the CSRD/ESRS also take into consideration all those topics that are material only in one way.\n\nThe Instone Group has assessed all the relevant topics for double materiality. As defined in Section 289c (2) and (3) and Section 315c HGB, and taking into consideration the existing measures and requirements within the Group, no \"material risks\" have been identified in our own business activities or in connection with our business relationships, products and services, which \"very likely [have or will have] serious negative effects\" on the topics described in the materiality matri[x page54.

With this approach, the Instone Group continues – even in a difficult environment – to make an important contribution to easing the shortage of affordable housing in Germany. Further information on the equity story can be found o[n page 30.](#page-29-0) \n\n#### Strategy in the context of sustainability\n\nThe Company's primary goal is to position itself as a leading neighbourhood developer in sustainability and social impact. The Instone Group pursues its sustainability goals at both the corporate and project level.\n\nAn important step in the strategic orientation of the Instone Group towards sustainability is also manifested in the further increased prioritisation of this topic by the Management Board of the Instone Group. This can be seen, for example, in the structural adjustments and further developments of our corporate organisation, which are closely supported by the Chairman of the Management Board, as a result of which the topic of sustainability is even more closely interlinked with the overall business strategy.\n\nFor the Instone Group, transparency and communication regarding key strategic goals for sustainability are not only an obligation to stakeholders but also an essential tool for building trust and maintaining an open dialogue with partners. This is why the Instone Group is proactively taking steps to bring its reporting in line with the CSRD/ESRS. In order to meet the ambitious requirements of the CSRD/ESRS, it is necessary to embed sustainability aspects in all relevant processes and practical operations. The inclusion of every single employee is essential to accomplish this.\n\nA crucial step in this transformation was to establish five Group-wide working groups, consisting of 30 employees from the various operations areas of the Company (e.g., project management, project development) and with diverse skills (see graphi[c page 4\\). S](#page-3-0)ince the end of 2022, these working groups have been working hard to operationalise our sustainability goals and establish them in practice. The working groups' specific goals are derived from the topics the Instone Group identified in its materiality analysis. They develop proposals for practical solutions and create guidelines for the Instone Group's future operations. After spending the last few years focussing on data availability and analysis, the previous year was spent optimising systematic and electronic data collection processes as well as comprehensive data analysis to build the foundation for further optimisation and critical decision-making for construction projects.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n- **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n- [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **The working groups focus on the following:**\n\n- **Sustainable building** Focus: Sustainable building materials and resource-optimised planning\n\t- **Hybrid timber** focus: timber as construction material\n- **Neighbourhood infrastructure** focus: energy, mobility and water management\n- **Neighbourhood impact**  Focus: social impact\n- **ESG inside** focus: Instone Group Work Environment Office and Construction Site\n\nThe results of each of the working groups are integrated into the Instone Group's material sustainability topics. One example of this is the \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group's close examination of heating systems. An efficiently planned heating system can help reduce operating emissions.\n\nThe project members are seen as the experts at the Instone Group and act as Group-wide sustainability ambassadors. All employees are invited to get involved in the process and offer suggestions.\n\nFurther details on work results can be found in the sections on the respective sustainability topics.\n\nSustainability is increasingly becoming an integral part of every link in our value chain, with the most emphasis placed on taking a holistic approach to the life cycle of a property. From the choice of construction materials and the construction process to the eventual operation – every phase is scrutinised in terms of sustainability. This comprehensive approach provides a holistic view of the environmental footprint of our real estate projects.\n\nAside from environmental aspects, the Instone Group takes into account both social and economic factors. An example of this is the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. Our subsidiary nyoo has set itself the goal of building with mass-produced and inexpensive components, making its product accessible to as many people as possible. The inclusion of all three sustainability dimensions can be seen in other areas as well, such as in the design of our projects (see also the section \"Cities/communities[\" page 112\\).](#page-111-0)  The cost-effectiveness of sustainable building methods and practices is seen not just as a goal in itself but as an integral part of our responsibility towards our investors and the economy.\n\n#### Value chain\n\nDetailed information on the Instone Group's value chain is provided in the section \"Foundations of the Group[\" page 36.](#page-35-0)\n\n#### Table of targets\n\n [table 004 p](#page-58-0)rovides an overview of our sustainability goals – all annotations are addressed and explained further in the subsections covering the environment, social matters and governance.\n\n#### Materiality analysis\n\n[TCFD risk management/metrics and targets](#page-289-0) \n\n#### Procedure ( )\n\nIn order to identify sustainability topics relevant to the Instone Group's business activities and stakeholders, the materiality analysis was redesigned and conducted in the financial year 2022. Since, after conferring with the Management Board, there have been no material changes either in the state of affairs or to the business activities of the Instone Group in 2023, this materiality analysis forms the basis for the sustainability topics reported. In preparation for the CSRD, the following financial year will see the re-identification and examination of material sustainability topics as part of a comprehensive materiality analysis based on the now-final ESRS requirements and the implementation guidance of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG).1\n\n<sup>1</sup> The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is a non-profit organisation that assists the European Commission with the application of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to EU accounting. In 2023, the EFRAG published the first three drafts of its implementation guidance for the ESRS.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group's underlying materiality analysis meets the requirements of Germany's CSRD Implementation Act (CSR-RUG) and HGB. The Instone Group is also guided by the GRI's requirements and the CSRD's/ESRS's definition/understanding of double materiality.\n\nThe following are therefore considered to be material:\n\n- Topics that have a material influence on or involve a material risk for the Company, its value or its activities (financial materiality) and/or <sup>2</sup>\n- Activities that cause the Company to have a material influence on its environment **(impact materiality).**\n\nThe assessment of which topics are material to the Instone Group from these two perspectives takes the form of a survey of representative internal key account managers concerning the positions of the following stakeholder groups: banks, investors, municipalities, associations and NGOs, employees and clients. Alongside the evaluations of the stakeholders' representatives, the findings of the Sustainability Department were taken into consideration as an additional group in the evaluation process.\n\nThe impact is assessed by evaluating three parameters:\n\n- 1. Scale: How important is the impact?\n- 2. Scope: Does the impact relate to the entire company or only to specific areas?\n- 3. Remediability: How easily can a negative impact be mitigated?\n\nThe financial materiality is assessed by means of the following three parameters:\n\n- 1. Scale: How significant is the financial risk?\n- 2. Scope: Does the financial risk relate to the entire company or only to specific areas?\n- 3. Remediability: How easily can a financial risk be mitigated?\n\nAll three parameters are given a score between zero and five using a manual assessment process. The final result of the evaluation of impact materiality and the financial materiality of a theme is the total of the parameters. The general procedure for the materiality analysis at the Instone Group can be found in the following graph (last performed in 2022). All key issues are monitored by the Sustainability Department on an ongoing basis (see also Risk Management, Due Diligence and Internal Control Syste[m page 124\\).](#page-123-0) [GRI 3, 3-1, 3-3](#page-287-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> Topics identified as material as defined in Section 289c (3) HGB.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Material topics under the CSRD and the ESRS that will be mandatory for the Instone Group starting with the annual report 2025.

reported over the life cycle according to the consolidated balance sheet group. The life cycle perspective does not allocate things to Scope 1, 2 or 3 and reports all emissions throughout the life cycle phases over a lifetime of 53 years. A distinction is made between operational carbon from the use phase and embedded carbon from the other phases (manufacture and dismantling).\n\n<sup>4</sup> Business-as-usual scenario \">– the emissions for electricity and district heating during the use phase were calculated here using a conservative approach, which envisages that the German energy sector will only pursue moderate decarbonisation (based on the study \"Energy projections and impact assessments 2030/2050\" by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, 2021).\n\n[TCFD metrics and

collected, consolidated and analysed data on environmental topics such as climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity and resource management. In the following sections, all topics identified as having at least single materiality are categorised into the appropriate areas.\n\n### **Climate change**\n\n- **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION**\n\t-\n\t-\n- \n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality ( )\n\nClimate change has been evaluated as material from the financial and impact perspectives. This is reflected in the assessment of the topics \"CO₂ emissions from building operations\" (E3), \"CO₂ emissions from building manufacture\" (E4) and \"Energy consumption and intensity\" (E13) as having double materiality. Climate change affects all strategic business decisions, such as the selection of the location of new projects, the choice of materials and design in the planning phase and the selection of heating systems for the buildings.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Instone Group announced its new climate strategy, which forms part of its sustainability strategy. This included the publication of the Company's long-term climate target: achieving net zero emissions along its entire value chain by 2045. The Instone Group also set a medium-term target of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 and has had this validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In addition, the medium-term target for scope 3 is currently being expanded. Work to develop appropriate action plans is continuing and validation by the SBTi will be accelerated in the coming years.\n\nTo identify the transition and physical risks and opportunities involved in the recommendations of the Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the climate scenario analysis that was redesigned in 2022 was updated in the financial year 2023. In addition, the work on incorporating and implementing the climate strategy as part of the general business strategy continued.\n\nAt the Instone Group, scope 1 comprises the company car fleet emissions, while scope 2 is based on electricity and heat consumption by offices and branches as well as electricity consumed at construction sites. Our Scope 3 emissions comprise those generated during the various life cycle phases of a building, such as the manufacture of building materials, as well as use and disposal. Our Scope 3 emissions also include those caused directly by the Instone Group, including business travel, employee commutes and emissions from buildings leased before project start.

gas (GHG) emissions are recorded based on a standard internal process. For Scope 3, this includes both the overall perspective and the life cycle perspective; for Scopes 1 to 3, this comprises all energy consumed as part of our business activities, which ensures all the impacts of our activities are covered.1\n\nOver the past year, the ESG Inside working group has developed a package of measures to reduce energy consumption in offices and at construction sites. Among other things, the group conducted a company-wide survey and interviews in order to gather as many opinions as possible and to generate ideas. The results form the basis for the further implementation of tangible measures.\n\nGHG emissions reporting for projects is shared within the organisation, so not just employees from the Sustainability Department but also employees from Project Service collect data and contribute to the consolidation work. Employees have been trained in the life cycle analysis software used for this reporting. Thanks to an increase in personnel capacity, data collection for initial projects is now carried out at an early planning phase. This means that potential optimisation options, such as alternative designs, can be assessed and compared at an early stage of the planning process. The Controlling Department's project management software is already able to retrieve the data on the average annual output of solar power systems/photovoltaics in projects, for example, internally. Retrieval is currently being expanded (SDM project) to include emissions and energy consumption, for instance for other climate-related key figures, and will soon be an integral part of the Instone Group's key figures system. Property-related aspects such as energy consumption and energy management systems have a significant impact on the recording of GHG emissions (especially Scopes 2 and 3) and thus are collected together.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The GHG emissions that we produce are divided up using two different approaches. On the one hand, we use the standard classification according to Scope 1, 2 and 3 as described in the GHG Protocol. From this perspective, the overall perspective, the emissions are recorded in the year they are produced. The downstream scope 3 emissions of products that have been sold are an exception. They are fully reported once they are sold in the year when they are handed over. In our case, this means that the emissions from the entire use phase (around 50 years) and the dismantling of the buildings which we completed in the financial year 2023 will be recorded in the same year. The life cycle perspective, the second method of presenting the data used in this report, assigns all the emissions from all the completed buildings in the reporting period to the relevant life cycle phases (manufacture, use, disposal). This allows us to distinguish between the operational emissions that result from energy consumption in the use of buildings (operational carbon) and the grey emissions that make up all the other emissions in the life cycle of a building (embodied carbon).\n\nIn terms of target attainment, the sum of GHG emissions from Scopes 1 and 2, which make up 0.5% of total emissions, fell by 46.1% absolute compared to the base year 2020 and by 61.5% in terms of GHG intensity/m<sup>2</sup> compared to the base year 2020. This means that, last year, the Instone Group (more than) met its SBTi-validated target for annual reductions, which involves decarbonising in accordance with the 1.5°C pathwa[y; figure006. T](#page-72-0)he Scope 2 improvements were mainly achieved by gradually switching offices and construction sites to green energy. The ongoing replacement of fleet vehicles with more fuel-efficient as well as electric models had further positive effects on scope 1 emissions. The measures listed below have the potential to reduce energy consumption and Scope 1 and 2 emissions next year as well.\n\nIn addition to the Scope 3 emissions from the project development process, there are emissions from travel and employee commuting, which make up around 0.1% of Scope 3 emissions. These emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the previous year, which is mainly due to the increased use of rail as the mode of transportation. The lower number of employees also resulted in lower emissions from commuting.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **Projected versus actual climate targets FIGURE 006**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n```\nRisk and \nopportunities report\n```\nGroup\nort\nCO₂e int\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nAt least -42% in une with\nthe SBTI-1.5°C scenario\n\nAlready achieved reduction\nfor Scope 1 and 2 emissions:\n-46.1%\n\n1.5°C path\n\nConstruction scenario\n\nClimate protection scenario\n\nLong\nClima\nin Sco\nand 3\n\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n\n<sup>3</sup> Climate change mitigation scenario: This calculation for scope 2 is based on the assumption that decarbonising the energy sector achieves climate neutrality in 2045 (based on Agora et al., 2021).\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The course of Scopes 1 and 2 is based on projects involving planned measures, taking planned growth into account.\n\n2 BAU scenario: This calculation for Scope 2 is based on the assumption that decarbonising the energy sector is only progressing moderately (in accordance with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, 2021).\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>C\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/20 description: This image is a line graph showing CO2e int emissions from 2020 to 2030.

This is based on a calculatory approach, which assumes that the construction phase lasts two years until the completion of the individual building. In the second year, emissions from the construction phase and all emissions from the use and disposal phases are recorded in the Scope 3 calculation. The comparison of Scope 3 emissions revealed a reduction in GHG intensity of 5.9% compared to the previous year (2022). This reduction can be attributed, among other things, to a reduction in the completed project area and thus to a reduction in emissions. The measures intended to help reduce scope 3 emissions in the medium and long term will only produce measurable effects in the coming years.\n\n#### EXCURSUS: In focus – Scope 3 emissions: Analyses and concrete examples from the Instone Group\n\nIn addition to creating cross-departmental working groups, another part of the refinement of our approach to reducing Scope 3 emissions and achieving our target of net zero emissions entails the analysis and comparison of the potential pathways for Scope 3 emissions. Here, we focused in particular on completed building[s. figure 007 s](#page-74-0)hows an example of the emissions reduction requirements for achieving our net zero target in accordance with the specifications of the SBTi. The information from the emission sources in the building's upstream and downstream value chain, from the perspective of the Instone Group as the project developer, and the technological options in the life cycle phases of the building were included in the process of identifying the requirements. This means that the selection of energy sources for the buildings developed by the Instone Group in the planning phase is directly connected to the reduction of GHG emissions. The process of recording the building information in the life cycle analysis software includes identifying energy sources, energy consumption and energy intensity.<sup>1</sup> This allows different energy concepts for individual projects to be compared and assessed. The results are reviewed and discussed by the operational working group focussed on \"Energy\". However, it must be assumed that the emissions in the use phase, for example, can be reduced more quickly than those in the manufacturing phase in the period up to 2030 because technologies and other measures that will deliver significant decarbonisation in the production of materials are only expected to become available after 2030. By contrast, the use phase is dependent on the energy sources used to provide heating and electricity. To achieve a substantial reduction in the emissions in the use phase by 2030, project developers are partly dependent on the pace of the expansion of renewable energies in the power grid and of centralised\n\nheating sources such as renewable district heating. In winter 2022, a project was begun to deduce what are known as marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). This work was continued in 2023 and applied to a specific project.\n\nA specific project was chosen as a usage example because the planning phase examined a total of three energy sources (pellet heating, cogeneration, heating pump with photovoltaic system) for the heat source and calculated project-specific investment costs. This information, combined with scientific information on the average emissions of the energy sources as well as operating, maintenance and consumption costs, allowed these energy sources to be compared in terms of emissions and potential costs over an assumed life cycle of 20 years. The results show that although the heating pump with photovoltaic system that was ultimately chosen had higher costs than the other energy sources, its use resulted in considerably lower emissions. However, this is only the case if it can be assumed that the heating pump is supplied exclusively with electricity from the photovoltaic system as well as electricity from renewable sources supplied by local utilities and not from Germany's general electricity mix (see comparison of two heating pump options).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FIGURE 008**\n\n#### <span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n- **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Comparison of the CO2 emissions of the heating systems in the application project FIGURE 007**\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/17 description: The image contains the title \"Comparison of the costs of thermal energy sources in the application project\".\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/18 description: This bar chart compares the costs of different heating systems. The y-axis is labeled \"Costs\" and ranges from 0 to €1,600,000 in increments of €200,000. The x-axis is labeled \"Heating systems\" and shows the following systems: Pellet heating (€920,000), Heat pump + booster pump (DE electricity mix) (€990,000), Heat pump + booster pump + PV (DE electricity mix) (€1,380,000), Heat pump + booster pump + PV (neighbourhood power) (€1,380,000), Co-gen w/ feed-in (€700,000), and Co-gen w/o feed-in (€910,000).\n\n WP = heat pump, PV = photovoltaic system, CHP = combined heat and power plant, CHP = combined heat and power generation.\n\n\\* The emissions of the neighbourhood electricity from the heating pump (HP) + heating booster pump + photovoltaic system (PS) are calculated on the assumption that the heating pump is powered with green electricity from the local utility in addition to the electricity from the PV system. This is assumed to be equally weighted with electricity from wind offshore, wind onshore and hydropower and calculated accordingly.\n\nIn addition, another analysis of scope 3 emissions in the use phase was conducted in the previous year to assess how various energy sources could potentially contribute to a scope 3 target. This analysis was performed by calculating how much the most relevant energy sources could reduce emissions and simulating the percentages of the portfolio that would have to be reached to achieve this internal target. The findings from the MACCs and projected trends, such as the change in emissions intensity in the electrical and district heating grids, were also factored in. This trend is based on information from the Fraunhofer Institute, which was compiled as part of a study commissioned by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on reaching climate neutrality by 2045.\n\nThe analysis based on this data showed that reaching climate neutrality by 2045 remains challenging even under very favourable assumptions and with an optimised portfolio of heating sources. The possible emissions reduction for the use phase could range between 35% and 58% by 2030, whilst a reduction of 59% compared to 2022 would be needed to reach the reduction benchmark of the 1.5°C pathway. We could expect a reduction of 47% to 86% by 2045, though this would not reach the necessary 97% of the benchmark. These reduction ranges include the reduction potential of possible changes to the heating and electrical grids as well as possible changes in the Instone Group's portfolio with regard to the use of heating sources.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FIGURE 010**\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n-35%\n-47%\n100\n-58%\n-59%\n50\n\n-86%\n-97%\n0\n2022 2025 2030 2035 2040\nYears\n\nPortfolio: Instone 2023/stagnation scenario\nPortfolio: district heating/climate change mitigation\nUse phase reduction benchmark (1.5°C pathway)\n\n**Possible CO2 reductions due to changes in energy networks and adjustments in portfolio shares**\n\nBoth the use of various energy sources in a specific project and the analysis of various future developments in the energy grids combined with various portfolio strategies paint a similar picture. When it comes to reducing Scope 3 emissions, the Instone Group is heavily dependent upon other industries, such as the energy industry and its emissions reduction efforts.\n\nOther analyses will be conducted in the coming year to investigate the effects of the analysis results on a possible Scope 3 emissions target. This will include monitoring of both the tense situation in the construction industry as well as the political situation in which renewable energies are not being developed at a sufficient rate and climate change mitigation subsidies are being questioned, with a view to defining appropriate measures. These analyses will also support our efforts to define measures that facilitate the setting and attainment of a scope 3 target.\n\nThe examination of the manufacturing phase is currently on hold as there is little concrete information available to quantify material emissions reductions.<sup>1</sup> The Instone Group expects that information will soon be available; however, scalable technologies for reducing GHG emissions (specifically in trades such as concrete, cement and steel) in the use phase will only be available starting in the 2030s (German Environment Agency, 2020).\n\n**Scenario for a potential Scope 3 net zero pathway for the completed buildings of the Instone Group (base year 2020)1**\n\n**FIGURE 009**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/20 description: This image shows a graph titled \"Scope 3 emissions target curve based on SBTI\".

The results again include specific quantitative calculations relating to cost, revenue and profitability. These were calculated factoring in market changes, regulations and changes in energy prices. The source of the scenarios – the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – was augmented where necessary with current material prices, macroeconomic data and internal information (detailed description of the scenarios and procedure in the annual report 2022).\n\nThe following results showed no significant changes from the previous year. All the scenarios include much higher increases in the costs of energy and emissions from 2023 to 2030 compared with the period between 2030 and 2050. In the 1.5°C scenario, this is due primarily to the energy sector's transition to a larger proportion of renewable energies and a faster phaseout of fossil fuels, including gas, which is reflected in a rapid rise in energy\n\nprices. From 2030 onwards, energy prices in particular will stabilise, while the CO₂ price will continue to increase slightly.\n\nThe 2.6°C scenario is based on a lower level of transformation activity, with a less dramatic rise in energy prices primarily as a result of the expansion of gas and, to some extent, renewable energies in response to the current energy crisis. Fossil fuels will remain in the energy mix in the long term. The CO₂ price will remain at a level that has no impact on our activities.\n\nUsing the scenario assumptions, we were able to develop chains consisting of drivers of climate risks and climate opportunities for business activities and for the upstream and downstream value chain in terms of both costs and revenue.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity assessment for manufacturing costs in the 1.5°C and 2.6°C scenarios as at 31 December 2023 TABLE 007**\n\n| Drivers                              | Affected KPIs                                                                                            | Net-Zero 2050 (1,5°C) –<br>Instone Group |        | Net-Zero 2050 (1,5°C) –<br>all industrial sectors |               | NDC (2,6°C) |     |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----|\n| Costs                                |                                                                                                          | Cost increase                            |        |                                                   |               |             |     |\n| Construction site equipment          | Transport price                                                                                          | Medium                                   | Medium | Medium                                            | Medium        | Low         | Low |\n| Excavation and foundations           | Concrete price                                                                                           | High                                     | Medium | High                                              | Not available | High        | Low |\n| Shell construction                   | Concrete price<br>Steel price<br>Sand-lime brick price<br>Timber price<br>Brickwork price<br>Brick price | High                                     | High   | High                                              | Not available | High        | Low |\n| Insulation                           | Insulation material<br>price                                                                             | Medium                                   | Low    | Medium                                            | Not available | Medium      | Low |\n| Windows                              | Glass price                                                                                              | Low                                      | Low    | Low                                               | Low           | Low         | Low |\n| Sanitary fittings<br>and accessories | Ceramic price                                                                                            | Medium                                   | Medium | Medium                                            | Not available | Medium      | Low |\n| Heating systems                      | Steel price<br>Plastic price                                                                             | Medium                                   | Low    | Medium                                            | Not available | Medium      | Low |\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nAs far as the **costs** are concerned, the scenario assumptions were used to calculate the changes in material prices that are relevant for the Instone Group's business model. The most important materials were identified and allocated on the basis of an overview of the construction costs for each trade. The materials that were analysed made up a total of 70% of the construction costs, while the remainder was below the materiality threshold of 5%. Each trade's share of the total amount of costs was examined in the reporting year. Despite some changes in material prices, there were no significant changes in this respect. Risk ratings changed in a few cases due only to shifts in the trades' shares of the costs.\n\nThe results show that, in the 1.5°C scenario, the highest cost rises can be expected up to 2030 and up to 2050. In the 1.5°C scenario, this is due to the falling emission and energy intensity of the material manufacturing processes. This reduction in intensity from 2030 onwards can be achieved in the main by increases in efficiency, the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the introduction of green hydrogen into the manufacturing processes for steel, concrete and bricks.\n\nRising prices in the context of persistently high energy prices and the accompanying faster transition to renewable energies are the decisive reasons behind the very similar cost increase in the period up to 2030 in the 2.6°C scenario. By contrast, the lower cost increases up to 2050 are due to the fact that in the 2.6°C scenario after 2030, fewer restrictive regulations concerning emissions and energy will be adopted and so the rise in the price of CO₂ and energy will be small.\n\n| Revenue drivers  | Affected KPIs                          | Risk and opportunity assessment |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Growth in space  | Growth in living space<br>(apartments) | Opportunity                     |\n| Subsidies        | Subsidies                              | Low                             |\n| Passing on costs | Margins                                | Medium                          |\n| Sales prices     | Margins                                | Opportunity                     |\n\nThe trade most affected by transition risks is shell construction. This is due partly to the predominant use of materials with a high emission and energy intensity, such as steel and concrete, and partly to the large proportion of the construction costs that they represent, which is around 31%.\n\nAlthough chains of climate risks and opportunities were identified on the **revenue side**, they could not be quantified in a comparable way because of the lack of assumptions in the scenarios. With regard to the possibility of passing on cost increases, rises in the sales prices of energy-efficient buildings or subsidies for sustainable building, studies and articles from publicly available sources were analysed and compared with internal information to produce a qualitative assessment of the results. On the revenue side, no differences were identified between the two climate scenarios.\n\nThe qualitative assessment of the revenue highlights two opportunities in particular. There are no obstacles to the corporate growth strategy even from the perspective of the 1.5°C scenario, as there will continue to be a need for more new apartment buildings. Another opportunity lies in the fact that the Instone Group already builds highly carbon- and energy-efficient buildings which initial studies, for example by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), show could potentially reach higher prices than conventional buildings.\n\nThe changing subsidy situation represents a minor risk. Grants are drying up, though these amount to only a small, single-digit percentage of revenue. Funding in the form of \"Climate-friendly new construction\" (KFN) funds benefit the Instone Group's clients, meaning it has no impact on our own subsidy situation. However, these grants have come to an end as applications for the KfW Federal Funding for Efficient Buildings scheme stopped being accepted on 14 December 2023.\n\nThe possible reduction in the option of passing on costs was categorised as a moderate risk. A comparison of historic data relating to construction prices and sale prices of new apartment blocks shows a slight fall in the trend for passing on price increases since 2021. Therefore, it is not possible to predict how this situation will develop. However, it is an important factor in assessing whether the forecast increases in the construction costs of buildings could become a risk for the Instone Group. The Instone Group will monitor this development at regular intervals in order to identify measures at an early stage.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn summary, the Instone Group uses the climate scenario analysis methodology for proactive transition management and for taking targeted measures at the right moment in the event of increased risks. However, the current analysis indicates that the Instone Group's business model is resilient to climate risks.\n\n**Physical climate risks** were also analysed in the financial year 2023 using Munich Re's Climate Risk Assessment Suite. All portfolio projects under construction and completed in the calendar year were analysed and all projects with high climate risks were required to make adjustments.\n\nfigure 011 shows the geographical distribution of different risks of the taxonomy-enabled properties in accordance with the consolidated accounting group with regard to the Munich Re climate risk assessment. High risks are expected for three projects in three different locations. Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia each have a project with an increased risk. Hamburg in particular is at risk from flooding and tornadoes. The locations in Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia have an increased risk from hail and tornadoes. Of the 23 projects surveyed, three projects (13%) have a high risk of at least two hazards. Countermeasures were included in the planning stage.\n\nThese measures were implemented in 2023. Other measures for managing high risks associated with certain physical hazards will be continually reviewed and implemented over the coming years.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/20 description: This image is a map of Germany from the \"Excerpt from the physical climate scenario analysis 2023 FIGURE 011\".

The achievement of sustainability in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation for buildings underpins the Instone Group's aim to demonstrate effective measures against environmental pollution and meet high standards.\n\nThe increased attractiveness of the projects is expected to have a positive impact on various interest groups, particularly clients, investors, financial institutions and employees. Measures against sources of pollution have been re-examined and modified as needed in order to minimise or completely eliminate the environmental pollution caused by each project. We will make sure that these efforts are successful by conducting structured and regular surveys of air, water and soil quality at all project locations in the future.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity perspective**\n\n[TCFD strategy](#page-289-0)\n\nIf there should be an environmental pollution incident that involves the law being broken, there is a risk of financial penalties, costs for rectifying the environmental damage and financial losses resulting from possible damage to the Company's image. The likelihood of such an incident is considered low because contractual regulations and the selection process for contractual partners are designed to ensure that we only do business with partners who at least always meet legal requirements. There is also the possibility that measures to prevent environmental pollution may need to be strengthened in order to meet both today's and tomorrow's regulations and to ensure projects are taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThese considerations also include potentially positive financial impacts and opportunities.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Water consumption and management ( )**\n\n**MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/18 description: The image shows the text \"E10 Water consumption and management\".\n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\n\"Water consumption and management\" (E10), including the protection of water resources, are part of the Instone Group's sustainability strategy and have double materiality as shown by the results of the materiality analysis.\n\nA physical climate risk analysis is used to monitor the extent to which increasing climate change is affecting water resources (see also the section \"Climate change\").\n\nIn addition, the Instone Group analysed water consumption and management, which include the protection of water resources, as part of a due diligence process in the financial year 2022. The causes of high water consumption and the risk of contaminating water in the context of our business activities are the result of:\n\n- existing pollution/contamination of the groundwater before the purchase of land,\n- water consumption on the construction site,\n- water consumption in the use phase of the building\n- discharge of waste water on the construction site,\n- Protection of bodies of water surrounding construction sites and new buildings.1\n\nThe financial year 2023 also saw a subgroup on \"Neighbourhood water management\" created as part of the \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group. This subgroup focuses mainly on solutions that can help promote the natural water cycle and reduce water consumption within neighbourhoods. In this context, the national water strategy was examined along with duties and requirements under legislation (the Water Framework Directive, the Federal Water Act etc.) and municipal codes. In addition, water management requirements based on various certification systems (such as from the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB)) were examined in detail. This information is used to derive potential measures and implement them for future project developments. For new projects, a checklist is available as a guide for the implementation of water management measures. A collection of best practices provides ideas and suggestions for practical implementation.\n\nThe target for \"Water consumption and management\" was to meet the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation for each topic<sup>2</sup> in at least 90% of all Instone Group projects concerned (buildings with commercial use). [TCFD metrics and targets](#page-289-0) [GRI 303, 303-1, 303-2, 303-3](#page-287-0)\n\nAs the Instone Group only develops properties in urban areas and therefore only comes into contact with marine resources indirectly via rivers flowing into the sea, these have been omitted from the package of measures.\n\n- <sup>2</sup> The Taxonomy Regulation specifies for the economic activity \"Construction of buildings\" (NACE: 41) in the action area \"Water\" the following \"do no significant harm\" (DNSH) criteria:\n- Specific water efficiency levels for sanitary facilities on commercial sites\n- Water on the construction site: Identifying and, if necessary, remedying the risks of environmental damage relating to the maintenance of water quality and the avoidance of water shortages\n- If not already covered by an environmental impact assessment: Preparation of a management plan for water use and the protection of bodies of water that may be affected.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Water consumption and management measures TABLE 010**\n\nTABLE 010\n\n| To our shareholders        | Material topic                   | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Degree of implementation1 |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Combined management report | Water consumption and management | Modification of bills of quantities for contractual partners to include the installation of sanitary facilities that meet the maximum flow rates of sanitary equipment such as sinks, showers, toilets and urinals2 (especially commercial) as well as water-saving sanitary facilities | In progress               |\n|                            |                                  | Establishment of a standardised process to record water consumption on construction sites in order to develop meaningful and measurable reduction measures                                                                                                                              | In progress               |\n| Foundations of the Group   |                                  | Inclusion of water-saving potential in accordance with the package of measures for sustainable and responsible water use in project and product development                                                                                                                             | In progress               |\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure; 2) In progress: Work is already proceeding to implement the measure; 3) Implemented: The measure has already been included in standard processes, e.g. in guidelines and work equipment.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The maximum flow rates are specified in accordance with the DNSH criterion of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for new builds.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Impact perspective**\n\nDue diligence showed that only a few measures relating to the protection of water resources as part of water management have been integrated into business processes to date. In this context and as part of the documentation requirements for the taxonomy audit, we have begun actively addressing the topic of water in our standard project development process. This ensures that measures for resource-conscious and sustainable water use are included early in the planning process.\n\nFor buildings with commercial units containing efficient sanitary equipment that complies with the EU taxonomy flow rates, the target of 90% was met in the financial year. This is the result of anticipatory planning and implementation as well as the replacement of equipment in some commercial units, among other measures.\n\nThe working group focussing on water use within neighbourhoods has already developed a package of measures designed to reduce water consumption during the use phase and have a positive impact in terms of groundwater levels and flood prevention in the case of torrential rain. The increased use of green spaces, for example, is not only conducive to the neighbourhood's micro-climate: The increased infiltration of storm water also supports the groundwater level and helps prevent flooding from torrential rain. More specific instruments, such as infiltration basins and tree trenches, can amplify these effects.\n\nIn terms of the building itself, green spaces or green façades can help regulate groundwater levels and prevent flooding from torrential rain whilst also offering additional benefits such as better insulation against heat and cold.\n\nThe \"Schönhof-Viertel\" in Frankfurt am Main is a good example of the water management measures that have already been planned and implemented. In this project, rainwater collected on the paved public areas is partly channelled through intermediate rigoles into rainwater wells in the public park. The rainwater collects there, seeps down through cleaning layers, is collected in the rainwater channel and ultimately conducted into an adjacent watercourse. On other plots, accumulated storm water is collected on green roofs or in trenches, then slowly conveyed into the storm water drainage channel.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity perspective** [TCFD strategy](#page-289-0)\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nAlthough the financial risk, for example, from the cost of water, may only be material in nature in the short to medium term (in the form of manufacturing costs), climate scenarios show the effects of increasing climate change, which include droughts and a fall in the groundwater table. In the medium to long term, the Instone Group estimates that local costs will rise if water temporarily becomes a rare commodity in some areas of Germany because of climate change. The drivers of cost increases could include rising water prices, higher costs of procurement and transport and possibly also additional costs caused by slower construction work in the event of bottlenecks.\n\nThe \"Neighbourhood infrastructure\" working group continuously monitors and evaluates water-related developments.

Biodiversity makes a central contribution to climate protection and adaptation to the consequences of climate change. Consequences of climate change are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, while this plays a central role as natural GHG storage. One example of increasing regulations in this area is the CSRD's disclosure requirements along with the associated ESRS, which address the topic \"Biodiversity and ecosystems\" in ESRS E4. Additionally, these requirements are mandatory for all sectors defined by the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) as \"priority sectors\". These include construction and building materials. This therefore includes the Instone Group.\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/24 description: The image shows the logo for the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The logo consists of a square divided into four smaller squares, with the letters T, N, F, and D in each square, respectively. To the right of the square is the text \"Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures\".\n\nThe TNFD is a market-oriented, government-\nsupported initiative that gives companies\nscience-based recommendations for responding\nto current and future nature-related problems.\nVarious committees of policy-makers, business-\npeople and scientists develop recommendations\nand guidelines to address and report on biodiversity\nrisks. The TNFD's recommendations primarily\nrelate to reportable structures, processes,\nmeasures, targets and key figures concerning\nnature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and\nopportunities.\n\nFor the overarching topic of biodiversity protection, a topic-specific due diligence review was carried out in the financial year 2022 to analyse where the highest risks of endangering biodiversity lie as posed by business activities. These risks still apply and have been augmented in the financial year 2023 by a pilot analysis based on TNFD recommendations:\n\n- Projects on land where endangered species live (can also concern brownfield projects),\n- Projects on land where non-endangered species live (can also concern brownfield projects),\n- Greenfield projects, especially on land with particularly high biodiversity,\n- Surface sealing,\n- All projects in the immediate or close vicinity of areas with high biodiversity and conservation areas.\n\nLikewise, we reviewed which precautions, regulations and measures have already been implemented to preserve biodiversity and whether there is a need for additional action. As formulated in last year's report, our target\n\ny\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\nfor biodiversity is to review the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation for each topic<sup>1</sup> before the acquisition of any potential Instone Group project.\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\nA pilot was conducted over the past year based on the\nrequirements of the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures (TNFD). To determine which of these required\nelements can already be provided by the Instone Group\n(baseline), a structured analysis was carried out.\n\nThe biodiversity and natural risks at select current project\nsites were also analysed as part of this process, as well as\nhow these risks can be mitigated. The analysis was used\nto define relevant site-, sector-and Instone Group-specific\naspects for each impact and each risk, and to determine\nfor these aspects potential targets, the measures to\nachieve these targets and metrics to monitor them. It also\nshowed where appropriate procedures could be integrated\ninto existing processes and where new processes need to\nbe defined. The results of the TNFD pilot are being used to\nspecify biodiversity-related measures and their implemen-\ntation and to refine measures from the annual report 2022.\nThese relate in particular to:\n\n- \n- \n\nImage /page/87/Figure/22 description: The image shows a numbered list of steps. Step 1 is \"Status quo: general information (TNFD requirements)\". Step 2 is \"Status quo: current strategies, processes, completed measures, targets, metrics\". Step 3 is \"Identification of current risks using the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter\". Step 4 is \"Translation of dependencies and risks into strategies and targets\".

For this reason, the Instone Group decided at the end of 2023 to register as a TNFD \"early adopter\" and to publish a TNFD-\n\ncompliant report starting in the financial year 2025.

This was done using the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter tool. The analysis produced an overview and assessment of potential risks to nature and biodiversity:\n\n#### **Potential project-specific risks to nature and biodiversity (excerpt from overall analysis)**\n\nEffects associated with a high risk are \"Change in land, water and marine use\", \"Loss of tree population\", \"Pollution\" and \"Protected areas\", meaning that these effects could pose both risks in relation to the environment and financial risks. Site-specific dependencies with high risk include forest productivity, water condition and media criticism. In particular, the subject areas in which mismanagement would have financial consequences for the Instone Group exhibit dependencies.\n\n**FIGURE 013**\n\n| ities report      |

For example, raising biodiversity standards as part of construction projects affects their implementation costs. In particular, the biodiversity-friendly design of green roofs and other areas on the plots to be used for construction land lead to an increase in costs. In addition, competing for space, i.e. the trade-off between leaving more space available than required by law and designing accordingly or the trade-off of including as much residential space as possible in the project or on the construction land, has an impact on the revenue achievable for the Instone Group.\n\n• Secondly, dependencies on natural resources have a financial impact. For this purpose, the analysis with the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter provides location-specific information. This enables the Instone Group to more detail the effects of potential risks on the company, development projects in particular and thus qualitatively also on financial performance.\n\nThe results of the TNFD pilot analysis are used to perform a detailed review of the identified risks so that the responsible operational working group can develop appropriate measures and processes.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Consumption of natural resources and recycling ( )**\n\n[GRI 301, 301-1, 301-2, 301-3, 306, 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4](#page-287-0)\n\n#### **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nConsumption of natural resources/recycling\n\nChoice of building materials\n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nThe effective use of resources and the transition to a circular economy are part of the Instone Group's sustainability strategy. The materiality analysis showed that \"Consumption of natural resources/recycling\" (E1) and \"Choice of building materials\" (E6), i.e. the use of environmentally friendly materials, have double materiality for the Instone Group. A key indicator of this is not least the fact that around 28% of the Instone Group's total carbon footprint1 comes from the manufacturing phase of our buildings. The gradual switch to recycled, reusable and reused building materials, such as recycled concrete or lumber, is therefore an important lever in achieving our climate targets.\n\nAs for the other environmental aspects, the Instone Group also analysed this topic in a due diligence review in the financial year 2022 to identify where the biggest potential for the optimal use of resources and circular economy lies within the scope of our business activities. In the financial year 2023, the following topics in particular were examined more closely:\n\n- Reduction in the use of carbon-intensive building materials (e.g. concrete, steel) through resource-optimised design\n- Increase in the proportion of building materials made of renewable raw materials (e.g. wood)\n- Increase in the proportion of recycled, reusable and reused building materials\n\nIn Germany, as much non-hazardous waste and rubble as possible is already sent for recycling or reuse under the Circular Economy Act (KrWG). Nevertheless, this topic and the provision of corresponding evidence have been included in the supplemental agreement on disposal (through purchase).\n\nThe target for \"Consumption of natural resources and recycling\" is firstly to meet the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation for each topic2 for all Instone Group projects by complying with legal obligations. Our target is also to make a significant contribution to carbon reduction by using sustainable building materials and reducing the use of materials in general as well as implementing this target in economically viable solutions. [TCFD metrics and targets](#page-289-0)\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Impact perspective**\n\nThe particular importance of this topic to the Instone Group is reflected in the creation of two working groups (\"Sustainable building\" and \"Hybrid timber\"), which work closely on measures relating to this area. These working groups identify potential for optimisation and develop concrete approaches for practical implementation.\n\n1 Includes Instone Real Estate Group SE Scopes 1, 2 and 3\n\n- 2 The Taxonomy Regulation specifies for the economic activity \"Construction of buildings\" (NACE: 41) the following DNSH criteria in the action area of circular economy:\n- \n- At least 70% of non-hazardous rubble/waste and demolition is sent for reuse or recycling. • Observance of best practices for the handling of hazardous substances and sorting of materials.\n- The design of the buildings and the construction techniques support the circular economy.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe \"Sustainable building\" working group focuses on assessing and classifying building materials and products with regard to material sustainability aspects such as carbon reduction, ingredients, supply chains and demolition. With the help of a building product matrix, the key building materials have been identified and specific alternative products named. Examples include eco-friendly limestone and low-carbon concrete. Solutions to reduce material use, for example through structural optimisation measures, as well as recommendations for sustainable building are also being developed.\n\nThe \"Hybrid timber\" working group specifically investigates the extent to which embodied carbon can be reduced by substituting structural components with timber solutions. As part of this research, the group conducted an LCA variant comparison1 using a specific example in order to calculate various designs (solid construction (standard), frame construction and 100% timber construction) and compare them with one another. This analysis not only included global warming potential and non-renewable primary energy but also specific considerations in relation to building costs and potential for the living space and construction time.\n\nWe are currently reviewing the gradual implementation into practice and further development of the interim results to determine their applicability to Instone Group projects. In addition, we constantly monitor technological progress with a view to modifying building materials and continuously review implementation options to ensure that we achieve our climate neutrality target.\n\n1 \"LCA\" stands for life cycle assessment. It is sometimes also called \"life cycle analysis\".\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Consumption of natural resources and recycling measures TABLE 013**\n\n**TABLE 013**\n\n| To our shareholders             | Material topic                                                                 | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Degree of<br>implementation |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| ► Combined<br>management report |                                                                                | Inclusion in all contracts with our partners of – and follow-up on – the requirement that the design of the buildings and the<br>building technology comply, at a minimum, with ISO 20887 or comparable standards for the assessment of the demolition<br>or adaptability of buildings to increase resource efficiency, adaptability, flexibility and ease of demolition                 | In planning                 |\n|                                 | Consumption of natural<br>resources/recycling                                  | Review of options for using recycled materials to develop and/or construct projects and<br>for recording and increasing the proportion of recycled and reusable materials used                                                                                                                                                                                                           | In progress                 |\n| ► Foundations of the Group      |                                                                                | Review of changes in the design of buildings to simplify the demolition process and allow for the reuse of materials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | In progress                 |\n| ► Sustainability report         |                                                                                | For demolition activities performed by the Instone Group for its projects:<br>revision of the requirements for service providers who carry out this work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | In progress                 |\n| ► Economic report               | Choice of building materials<br>(use of environmentally<br>friendly materials) | Analysis of the building materials used to date for alternatives, especially in terms of sustainable<br>material choice, climate change mitigation, resource conservation, protection of human health and<br>the environment, as well as sustainable supply chains with consideration to cost-effectiveness<br>Analysis of implementation options for hybrid timber construction methods | In progress                 |\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n1 The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure;

This is due on the one hand to the volatility of prices for conventional as well as natural building materials, and on the other hand to the fact that products made from recycled, reusable or natural raw materials are not available on the market in sufficient quantities, if at all. Resource-optimised designs can help further reduce the use of carbonintensive building materials in the future and save on costs.\n\nIn some cases, the right technology does not yet exist, such as for cement, to fully realise effective resource use and the transition to a circular economy. Based on the findings of the Climate-Neutral Germany 2045 study1 , the Instone Group does not expect to have access to a low-emission product until the early 2030s at the earliest. The \"Sustainable building\" working group continually monitors developments and examines them for feasibility. Currently, there is no data available to collect.

Accordingly, the Instone Group is not required to submit any report on EU taxonomy this reporting year, although it has voluntarily disclosed its activities under the applicable Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nUnder Article 8 (1) and (2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, companies are required to disclose their taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned revenue, CapEx and OpEx. This requirement is substantiated by delegated acts both in content (Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and adaptation; Complementary Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and adaptation; Complementary Delegated Act to determine sustainable activities for the environmental objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) and formally (Delegated Act on Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, including corresponding annexes; Delegated Act on disclosure requirements and amendments thereto in complementary delegated acts).\n\nPotential taxonomy-eligible revenue, as well as CapEx and OpEx, fall below the defined materiality threshold of 3%. The Instone Group's interpretation is that information is only to be included if it is necessary for an understanding of business operations, situation and anticipated development. This is in line with the interpretation of the Accounting Standards Committee of Germany (ASCG) in its submission to the European Commission on various issues related to the application of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation of 7 December 2021.\n\nIn order to determine the relevance of the activities and related revenue, as well as CapEx and OpEx, to the Instone Group, it was necessary when preparing this report to evaluate the taxonomy disclosure of the Instone Group with regard to these three items, revenue, CapEx and OpEx, as follows:\n\na. Revenue from project development is recognised in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group mainly using the \"revenue recognition over time\" method in accordance with IFRS 15. However, some of the technical screening criteria (e.g. \"blower door test\") and the DNSH criteria can only be finally tested/documented after a new building is completed.\n\nIn order to present taxonomy-aligned revenue for the appropriate period and also to position it in relation to the total annual revenue and thus develop a meaningful statement on the matter, it is essential to define criteria that indicate taxonomy alignment even before the completion of construction and when the revenue is recognised according to the \"revenue recognition over time\" method. In this respect, too, the recognition of revenue over time is congruent with the taxonomy assessment and already assumes the contractual fulfilment of the specification before final inspection once construction is complete.\n\nb. In the IFRS consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group, capital expenditure therefore comprises, according to Annex I to the Delegated Act on Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the costs accounted for based on the following standards:\n\na) IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraph 73 (e) (i) and (iii)\n\nb) IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118 (e) (i)\n\nc) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 76 (a) and (b) (for the fair value model)\n\nd) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79 (d) (i) and (ii) (for the cost model)\n\ne) IAS 41 Agriculture, paragraph 50 (b) and (e)\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### f) IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53 (h)\n\nOnly non-significant balance sheet items fall under this definition at the Instone Group. This is due to the nature of the business model. Intangible assets and right of use assets that are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 and IFRS 16 and thus fall under the taxonomy-aligned categories mentioned account for less than 1% of the Instone Group's total assets and are therefore immaterial in terms of their informative value for the taxonomy-enabled or taxonomy-aligned reporting on the business model of the Instone Group under the activity \"Construction of new buildings\".\n\nc. In the taxonomy, OpEx refers to direct, non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building refurbishment, short-term leasing, maintenance and repair, and all other direct expenses related to the dayto-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment by the Company or third parties to whom activities are outsourced which are necessary to ensure the continuous and effective functioning of these assets. This OpEx must be related to activities that are taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe EU taxonomy requires the introduction of an operational process for reviewing and checking the taxonomy criteria. Under the Taxonomy Regulation, an activity is considered to taxonomy-aligned if it makes a significant contribution to at least one of a total of six environmental objectives without running counter to the others (DNSH). Minimum requirements must also be met. The taxonomy's environmental objectives are: (1) Climate change mitigation, (2) Climate change adaptation, (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) Transition to a circular economy, (5) Pollution prevention and control, and (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe business model of the Instone Group is to develop residential properties. This is a taxonomy-eligible activity, \"Construction of new buildings\", for which there are technical screening criteria on the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as DNSH criteria in order to assess a potential alignment. With the publication of the final version of the Environmental Delegated Act on environmental objectives 3–6 (22 November 2023), the activity \"Construction of new buildings\" also falls under the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy\". With the activity \"Construction of new buildings\", Instone Real Estate Group SE is currently making a significant contribution to 1) Climate change mitigation, since 100% of projects are already examined for their contribution to this environmental objective and climate change mitigation is the Company's strategic priority. The Instone Group identified this\n\nrelationship in its operational review of projects, since the environmental objective of climate change mitigation is directly applicable through the technical screening criteria and can be influenced in all Instone Group projects. Another possible criterion aside from (1) Climate change mitigation is environmental objective (2) Climate change adaptation, which also includes the construction of new buildings as a taxonomy-eligible activity. Following the publication of the Delegated Act on environmental objectives 3–6 in 2023, the Instone Group's activity \"Construction of new buildings\" also falls under environmental objective (4) Transition to a circular economy. On the basis of a renewed review of all environmental targets and their fulfilment criteria for the new construction business activity, it was also determined in the year under review that the economic activity of the Instone Group can still be assigned to the environmental objective of climate protection. This means that the activities of the Instone Group are not examined in relation to any other environmental objectives.\n\nUnder the environmental objective (1) Climate change mitigation, the derived technical screening criteria are the energy efficiency (primary energy demand) of the new building (exceeding the national NZEB requirements established in the German Building Energy Act of 2021 by at least 10%), air-tightness and thermal integrity. Where the total area exceeds 5,000 m2, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are also recorded. In addition, the specific DNSH criteria for the environmental objectives of (2) Climate change adaptation, (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) Transition to a circular economy, (5) Pollution prevention and control, and (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems are also checked.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe DNSH criteria are checked as follows:\n\n- (2) Climate change adaptation: Physical climate risk analysis based on a building life of about 55 years and summary of the analysis (list of hazards with high risk, time and climate scenario). For buildings with high risk: Summary of planned measures.\n- (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: proof of water efficiency for commercial spaces in the tender and product description of sanitary facilities. Further proof is supplied from notifications of water rights and statements from the competent water authorities.\n- (4) Transition to a new circular economy: binding agreement with contractual partners to comply with Section 14 (2) KrWG as well as with the annotations in the EU's Draft Commission Notice of 19 December 2022 and to consider standard building elements in accordance with DGNB TEC 1.6. The corresponding supplemental agreement was revised and amended in November 2023.\n- (5) Avoidance and reduction of environmental pollution: binding agreement with contractual partners to avoid the use of toxic building materials and proof using material data sheets. Investigation of the land, compilation of soil surveys and documentation of any necessary measures.\n\n• (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: proof using, for example, wildlife surveys for flora and fauna as well as key fertility figures for arable land.\n\nThe Instone Group has made the necessary adjustments to existing processes and added responsibilities, for example, data collection and analysis, determination of taxonomy eligibility and alignment, and accounting classification, to existing internal or process descriptions, such as the accounting guidelines and project documentation guidelines, in accordance with the technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria and process descriptions.\n\nTo assess taxonomy alignment, the Instone Group uses a standardised taxonomy form containing the relevant technical screening criteria along with information on where to find proof and the result of the assessment. The implementation of the assessment process at the building level is led by the Sustainability department in coordination with project managers in the individual branches. The Finance department is responsible for implementation at the accounting level.\n\nThe EU taxonomy requirements for minimum safeguards and the associated review of the\n\n- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,\n- UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and\n- International Convention on Human Rights with related due diligence\n\nare covered by the Instone Group through its generally implemented process for reviewing directives, work materials/resources and policies at Group level. This also includes compliance with legal regulations, statements on addressing human rights, for example via the Code of Conduct for employees and contractual partners, occupational health and safety, the environment, combating bribery and corruption, and taxes, for example via corporate policies. The review is conducted on a regular basis and is coordinated between the responsible Legal Department and the responsible departments at Group level, and is broken down into the subsidiaries if necessary.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### EU taxonomy and strategic relevance\n\nThe Instone Group is pursuing the strategic goal of reviewing all new projects for alignment with the EU Taxonomy Regulation environmental objective of climate change mitigation. In the 2023 financial year, a rate of 90.0% (previous year: 86.7%) of the project revenues can be achieved as being in line with the taxonomy. In 2023, all projects and subprojects relevant to revenue were analysed. Likewise, 152 of the 167 (previous year: 167 of 191) buildings relevant to revenue achieved taxonomy alignment.

are material for the Instone Group from the impact perspective. Employees plan and implement projects, develop innovations and drive transformation. They work to solve the following key challenges:\n\n- creating sufficient and affordable housing,\n- further developing environmentally sustainable and climatefriendly construction methods,\n- designing neighbourhoods in German urban areas that are worth living in.\n\nThe topic of employee diversity is of particular relevance to the Instone Group (double materiality). Employee diversity is a core element of the ideals of the Instone Group. The organisation is made up of lots of different people (age, gender, ethnic origin etc.) who significantly shape the diversity of the Instone Group. The personality of every single individual is extremely important. However, a good work-life balance, occupational health and safety, fair pay and good working conditions are also essential to achieve a high level of employee satisfaction.\n\nAll topics relating to employees and their concerns are the responsibility of the HR Department and are clarified with the responsible Chief Human Resources Officer, Andreas Gräf, and where co-determination law is concerned, with the works council. As part of the due diligence process, this department takes over the planning and implementation of measures for key topics in the area of employee issues and coordinates with the Sustainability Department in accordance with the governance concept [page 183.](#page-182-0) Our internal Legal department advises on legal matters. [GRI 2-30,](#page-286-0) [407, 407-1, 409, 409-1](#page-288-0) The key figures relating to our employees can be found i[n table 004.](#page-61-0)\n\nWith regard to employees, our goal is to both continuously review existing processes and structures and, if necessary, reorganise and restructure them.

information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Employee diversity (S1 )**\n\nAt the Instone Group, diversity means forms of work in which different skills, talent, experience and beliefs can play a role. In line with the core elements of the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter) as well as the commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in compliance with the International Labour Standards of the ILO, the Instone Group is committed to the issues of diversity and respect for human rights and acts both within the Group and with contractual partners in accordance with these guidelines. In addition, vacancies are advertised and filled in accordance with the German General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). In this sense, the Instone Group is committed to always treating both applicants and employees equally, regardless of differences in age, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, religion, ideology or other characteristics.\n\nThe Instone Group endeavours to increase the percentage of women in leadership positions and uses targets as an instrument to promote gender equality. The current distribution and target rate of managers by gender can be found in [table 004. F](#page-61-0)urther information on the topic of diversity at the Supervisory Board and Management Board levels also can be found on [page 191. T](#page-190-0)he process of achieving this target is assessed through continual due diligence. The Management Board will next review the target rates for the first and second management levels under the Management Board as well as for the Board itself in 2025. Considering almost no vacancies were filled in the past year due to the economic situation, there have been hardly any changes in distribution compared to the previous year. The goal of organic employee growth, which could not be pursued in the reporting year due to the economic situation, remains in the long-term but must be revised for the financial year 2024. The target is to keep the number of employees at the current level.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the Instone Group established a working group from the HR and Communications Departments to conceptualise and refine the topic. The group's first step was to conduct a comparative analysis using the Diversity Charter. In addition, strategic considerations were made to continuously expand the diversity issue at the Instone Group. To this end, initial implementation ideas were exchanged and agreed in close coordination with the Management Board.\n\nThe Instone Group is laying the foundation with the establishment of the uniform management principles developed in 2022. The importance of employee diversity is addressed in this report. These principles also emphasise heterogeneous team structures, a variety of personalities and skills and the diverse strengths of employees as key success factors. With the implementation of the management principles, the Instone Group is creating a binding framework and enshrining the topic of diversity in the Company's culture. Responsibility for this lies with the HR Department in close coordination with the Management Board. [GRI 405](#page-288-0)\n\n#### **Work-life balance (S2)**\n\nDue to the increasing digitalisation of work processes, work environments can now also be outside the traditional office setting. As an attractive employer, the Instone Group normally offers employees the option of mobile working – working from any location – two days per week, though operations must maintain the necessary level of efficiency. The current works agreement governs the possibilities and conditions for mobile working whilst also protecting operational processes, ensuring the security of the company IT network and defining the precautions and preventive measures necessary for occupational health.\n\n#### **Employee satisfaction (S13)**  [GRI 202-2](#page-286-0)\n\nAside from recruiting skilled and junior personnel, employee loyalty is a chief concern and a strategic challenge in the face of the ongoing skills shortage. Employee satisfaction is a key lever in this regard. Risks may arise if key vacancies cannot be filled in a timely manner – or at all. Opportunities arise from redirecting skilled workers towards attractive and secure employers such as the Instone Group.\n\nOne approach to providing employees with personal development opportunities and retaining them more closely with the company is the internal mentoring programme. This supports young leaders at the Instone Group in finding their leadership role. In this programme, mentees are supported by experienced mentors over a period of two years. The programme also gives young managers the opportunity to grow their internal network and gain experience from various keynote speeches.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group also offers all employees an extensive training and professional development programme. In addition to the mandatory training on data protection, IT security and compliance (anti-corruption and competition law), employees have the opportunity to participate in professional training, soft skills training and individual training.\n\nThe Instone Group's good kununu<sup>1</sup> rating of 3.9 qualifies it as a top employer.<sup>2</sup> The annual employee survey showed a Group-wide participation rate of 72% in the 2023 financial year (previous year: 82%). The participation rate thus remained at a high level. However, the survey showed that employee satisfaction (very satisfied/satisfied) fell 28% to 47% (previous year: 75%). In the reporting year, more employees rated their satisfaction as neutral (34%). This can be explained by the changing market situation, the tense economic situation and the resulting high degree of uncertainty. Due to the challenging market conditions, planned adjustments to reduce platform costs were also implemented in the past year. As a result, the fluctuation rate in the reporting year was higher (16.0%) than in the previous year (9.3%). The average length of service, on the other hand, rose slightly to 7.3 years (previous year: 6.5 years[\\). GRI 401-1](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Instone Group enables young people to gain practical experience and take on responsibility early on. The Company employs a large number of interns and student trainees to give them an insight into the work of a project developer and to recruit them into a permanent position after graduation. In addition to a targeted induction plan devised by the relevant specialist department and the HR department, areas of responsibility are transferred gradually to new employees.\n\nThe \"New work\" trend is also gaining traction at the Instone Group. The digital workplace is an important step in the transformation into a modern work environment. We are digitising communication, tools, processes and information in a strategically effective way. This makes efficient, modern mobile working possible for employees.\n\nThe Instone Group is also keen to address the increasing importance of having a sense of purpose in the workplace. In implementing its corporate and sustainability strategy, the Instone Group is clearly demonstrating that it takes its responsibility seriously. The Instone Group is transparent in showing what solutions it is addressing in relation to social topics that are part of its business model, for example by establishing working groups to examine these topics. The sustainability strategy and related ambitions that the Instone Group has are taken into account when designing individual job profiles with their duties.\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety (S4)**\n\nThe Instone Group's external service provider for the topic of occupational health and safety is responsible for the identification and analysis of potential emergencies. Accident prevention is pursued through regular training, workplace and construction site inspections as well as (safety) instructions to increase the safety of employees, contractors and clients.\n\nTogether with the occupational safety service provider and the accident prevention and insurance association for the construction industry, it is ensured that all relevant legal requirements and internal guidelines are met. Instone Group construction sites are secured with temporary fencing surrounding the property. Debris netting, covered walkways and adequate lighting and signage are all monitored by security services where necessary. Safety officers in all areas of the Company support the occupational health and safety team.\n\n<sup>1</sup> https://inside.kununu.com/kununu-pruefprozess/ and https://inside.kununu.com/wie-kununu-datenverarbeitet/\n\n<sup>2</sup> Portal for applicants and employees to rate employers created by the social media network Xing.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe continuous monitoring and improvement of occupational health and safety as well as offers of programmes to promote health are all geared towards prevention. Employees were offered regular eye check-ups in the financial year 2023. In addition, a company-wide psychological risk assessment was carried out for the first time. The six core dimensions of work content, working time, social relations, work organisation, work environment and work equipment were examined. [GRI 403, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 403-8, 416, 416-1](#page-288-0)\n\n#### **Fair pay and remuneration (S10)**\n\nThe Instone Group's remuneration framework forms the basis for fair market value pay for employees. Accordingly, remuneration is determined by an employee's position, experience, responsibilities and work quality – and is non-discriminatory and performance-based. Comparisons of the last few years show that the differences caused by demographic factors are gradually levelling out. The Instone Group continues to make every effort to eliminate any and all unjustified differences in remuneration between employees. The Group bases the remuneration of its employees on the collective agreement for the construction industry, which also ensures that the conditions are in place for the statutory minimum wage and fair remuneration. In addition to the current works agreements, the commitment to the collective bargaining agreement forms the basis for a transparent salary structure.\n\n#### **Social dialogue/good working conditions (S12)**\n\nAs an employer, the Instone Group is not aware of employee membership or involvement in trade unions. At the Instone Group, there is a general works council at Group level and in the subsidiaries, plus employee representatives in the North-east (Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig), West (Essen, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main) and South (Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart) regions. Employees at all levels work on the basis of trust-based working time. Employees' supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the general occupational health and safety rules are followed. As part of a works agreement, each employee is given three days of time off in lieu per year scheduled by site.\n\nFeedback that employees wish to give regarding their work, duties or leadership can be noted in Management Board livestreams. Alternatively, the anonymous whistleblower contact option can be used. Over the past year, communication channels and interactions were expanded in order to remain in contact, particularly in these current challenging times. These include regular on-site visits and video messages by the Management Board to reach all employees as directly and simultaneously as possible as well as the set-up of an anonymous query tool so employees can submit questions at any time. These questions can then be addressed and answered in writing and/or in the Management Board livestream.\n\nTo promote internal and external social commitment, the Instone Group allocates at least one working day per year as a social day and involves all employees at the respective location in this initiative.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Contractual partners in the supply chain and their employees**\n\n**MATERIAL TOPICS IN THIS SECTION:**\n\nContractual partner fair pay\n\nG7 Fair competition\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nWithin the scope of its project development, the Instone Group works in partnership with its contractors. Among other things, the Instone Group awards the implementation of its construction projects to contractual partners, who take over the various construction activities under the coordination of Instone Group project management. As a result, our contractual partners' employees play a key role in that they complete the projects of the Instone Group successfully and to a high level of quality. This means that these employees, some or all of whom are working at the construction site, are exposed to different risks than employees working in offices.\n\nThe Instone Group endeavours to establish lasting and dependable partnerships with its contractual partners. Once an order is initiated, sustainability topics are discussed with the contractual partners and the results documented in the minutes of the meeting in order to increase transparency and ensure these topics are included in the collaboration. This also allows us to comply with the various regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Purchasing Department is primarily responsible for the management of material topics under \"Contractual partners in the supply chain and their employees\". The current (regulatory) requirements for sustainable cooperation, especially in construction, are addressed in regular exchanges with the Sustainability department and translated into concrete (communication) measures. Given that legal requirements are continually changing, it is important to include contractual partners in this process and notify them of any changes at an early stage. This is especially true with the current drafts of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which is expected to become relevant to the Instone Group from 2025 once it is finalised. We have already conducted a preliminary review of the potential implications and requirements for the Instone Group. The Instone Group will continue to monitor these developments and take appropriate measures as soon as the final version with binding requirements is passed.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\n#### **Contractual partner fair pay (S10) | Fair competition (G7)**\n\nThe Instone Group awards single or (partial) general contracts for construction services. In cooperation with the Project Service and Project Management departments, bills of quantities are created based on planning documents, building specifications, expert reports and other documents, and invitations to tender are then sent by Purchasing on a trade-specific basis to a predefined group of tenderers.\n\nThe tenders submitted are compared in a price table. Depending on the requirement, the tenders are negotiated with the potential contractual partners in a process that is transparent within the Company; this process is recorded and any changes, for example to the scope of work, are recorded in the contract. Every decision to award a contract is made following a standardised multiple-control verification process. This open and transparent process is a key component of any lasting, trusting cooperation and ensures fair competition.

If these criteria are not met or not satisfactorily met, they can be adjusted before, during and after a project.\n\nThe assessment criteria are compiled into the following main groups:\n\n- Contractual matters\n- Quality of work\n- Project completion\n- ESG criteria\n\nIn light of our social responsibility, we focus on the following criteria in particular:\n\n- Fair pay: compliance with the statutory minimum wage applicable in Germany\n- Occupational health and safety\n- Compliance with the statutory working hours regulations\n- Collaboration in preparing the occupational health and safety concept on construction sites (as described in the section on the Company's employees)\n- Compliance with accident prevention and insurance association recommendations on occupational health and safety, such as those in the construction site regulations\n- Compliance with human rights and a complete refusal to employ anyone involved in forced labour, human trafficking, child labour or illicit wor[k GRI 408, 408-1, 409, 409-1](#page-288-0)\n\nWe also increasingly expect our contractual partners to pay greater attention to all topics of environmental relevance, such as climate change mitigation, pollution and the circular economy.

Responsibility is firmly rooted in our corporate culture and therefore in the Group's day-to-day business. As a company, the Instone Group wishes to establish a successful long-term collaboration with cities and communities whilst also demonstrating its social responsibility to people and the environment. In many projects, the Instone Group is not only the residential developer but also the neighbourhood developer – we design living space.\n\nThe concept of \"social impact development\" has become increasingly important. Project developers like the Instone Group are strengthening collaboration with urban planners and urban development policy, initiatives, NGOs, cooperatives and civil society. This means that neighbourhoods can be developed sustainably with existing structures being optimised instead of replaced. Urban development driven by social impact can be described as a discipline of urban planning that involves all stakeholders to a greater degree. Taking into account ESG, EU taxonomy and certification requirements, the Instone Group is a trusted partner for all the different stakeholders in the neighbourhood. Under \"social impact\", the Instone Group combines the impact on the neighbourhood (\"neighbourhood impact\") and the construction of (affordable) housing.\n\nThe challenge of designing living space lies in the fact that current planning must reflect the state of the art for development, energy supply, mobility, neighbourhood needs, local recreation and the environment 20 years from now and beyond in order to create an attractive living environment for all residents over the long term. As a neighbourhood developer, the Instone Group feels it has an obligation to offer residents and the area surrounding the neighbourhoods a positive \"neighbourhood impact\" whilst also supplying urgently needed housing.\n\nThe supply of affordable housing in Germany's metropolitan areas is one of the greatest challenges of our times. In Germany, hundreds of thousands of homes are lacking – and the trend is rising. Forecasts for 2025 are estimated at 700,000 missing housing units.<sup>1</sup> Current demand is not being met and the situation is deteriorating with every passing year. Despite the population in Germany increasing by 1.1 million people in the past year, residential building permits fell 28.5% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. 2 This increases rents and sale prices to such an extent that people in many income groups can no longer afford to buy residential property. Many rent-controlled homes are also coming to the end of their rent control period. This means that more homes are losing the protection of rent control than are being built each year.<sup>3</sup> The number of subsidised units decreased from around 2.1 million to 1.1 million from 2006 to 2022<sup>4</sup>, and has therefore nearly halved. As a result, the supply of affordable housing in metropolitan areas is coming under ever-increasing pressure, and this situation will be further exacerbated by current inflation trends as well as higher interest rates, building costs and energy prices.\n\n<sup>4</sup> Statista, 2023: https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/892789/umfrage/sozialwohnungen-in-deutschland/\n\n<sup>1</sup> ZIA, 2023: \"Konzentrierte Aktion Wohnen: Was es jetzt braucht, um den Wohnungsbau endlich wieder anzukurbeln\" [Concerted action: housing – what it will take to get residential construction going again]. https://zia-deutschland.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/zia\\_positionen\\_aktion\\_wohnen\\_2023\\_Druckversion.pdf (German only)\n\n<sup>2</sup> bulwiengesa, 2023: \"Die 5%-Studie – wo investieren sich noch lohnt\" [The 5% study – where is investing worth it?]. https://bulwiengesa.de/sites/default/files/2023-09/5\\_prozent\\_studie\\_2023\\_deutsch.pdf (German only) <sup>3</sup> bulwiengesa, 2023: https://bulwiengesa.de/de/magazin/doppelter-sinn-gefoerdertes-wohnen-als-investment\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n- **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nA rethink by all those involved in a project development, such as administrations, politicians, project developers and investors, is therefore required in order to build even the 400,000 new homes per year called for by the German Federal Government. Among other things, this requires that approval processes be reduced, support policies standardised and the standards situation and building legislation considerably simplified. The long-term planning security that would result from these political and legal adjustments would improve investor confidence and allow project developers to plan cost-effectively and with confidence. In this context, the Instone Group has defined affordable housing as a topic with double materiality.\n\nAs such, the supply of affordable yet sustainable and liveable housing is one of the most pressing social issues of this time if the current shortfall is to be made up. As a project developer, the Instone Group is aware of its responsibility and, despite the tense market situation, is making an important contribution to meeting the housing demand in Germany with the construction of its residential housing projects. This includes both the creation of housing in general and the supply of affordable housing for a large target group in particular. The Instone Group is achieving this by constructing subsidised and price-controlled housing whilst also, with the cost-optimised residential concept of its subsidiary nyoo, pursuing the goal of affordable building and affordable housing through mass-production planning and standardised production.\n\nThe management of material topics in this action area is primarily the responsibility of the managers at Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and Nyoo Real Estate GmbH. As part of a due diligence process, they assume responsibility for planning and implementing material topics in the area of \"Cities and communities\" and, if necessary, come to an agreement with the Sustainability Department and committee in accordance with the governance concept. In addition, a permanent working group focussed on this topic is developing implementation ides for sustainable neighbourhood development and using those ideas to develop concrete measures for future projects.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cities and communities measures TABLE 018**\n\n|                               | Material topic                   | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Degree of<br>implementation |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| To our shareholders           |                                  | Review of higher-level certifications (e.g. serial certification for the nyoo planning toolbox)                                                                                                                                                             | In progress                 |\n| Combined<br>management report |                                  | Specialist lectures at subject-specific events, municipalities, municipal associations<br>(such as Deutscher Städtetag (an association representing German cities and towns)) to<br>demonstrate the added value of the Instone Group and nyoo in all phases | Implemented                 |\n| Foundations of the Group      | Affordable housing               | Evaluation of funding opportunities                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | In progress                 |\n|                               |                                  | Initiation and hosting of curated events together with leading industry associations<br>to sustainably increase the innovative power of the industry/mass-production building                                                                               | In progress                 |\n| Sustainability report         |                                  | Evaluation of strategic partnerships in portfolio holding                                                                                                                                                                                                   | In progress                 |\n| Economic report               | Development of<br>neighbourhoods | Social impact guide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Implemented                 |\n|                               | neighbourhoods                   | Social impact scoring model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | In progress                 |\n|                               | Social commitment                | Development of a participation process guide                                                                                                                                                                                                                | In progress                 |\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure;

The Instone Group ensures an optimised project workflow in particular by taking the lean management approach using the \"beeboard\" software.\n\nThe construction of urgently needed affordable housing is a primary concern. The Instone Group defines affordable housing as all units that are subsidised or enter the market at a pre-set price. The Instone Group also includes all units built based on the cost-optimised nyoo concept. Our goal is to have at least 50% of our residential units be categorised as affordable housing by 2030 (see table of targets o[n page 68\\) a](#page-67-0)nd, until then, to steadily increase the proportion of this kind of housing in our overall portfolio.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Instone Group is taking two approaches: The first approach is to review at the start of every project how many subsidised and price-controlled units can and must be constructed. The development plan frequently specifies a minimum percentage of the total volume or, for new development plans, the Instone Group speaks directly to the appropriate city or local authority. The funding terms can also vary between federal states, cities and local authorities. On this basis, the Instone Group is evaluating economically viable solutions. Responsibility lies with the respective operating subsidiary. The second approach is to accomplish the goal specifically by increasing nyoo's project portfolio.\n\nThis approach is based on the \"nyoo concept\". nyoo has set a goal of using serial planning and production to build more affordably. By consistently standardising and optimising the entire project development and building process, nyoo is able to keep manufacturing costs low. At the heart of this conceptual approach is digitalisation and standardisation on three levels: product, process and production. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of planners, architects, project developers, project managers and office management staff covers the majority of the value chain with its work. This mass-production concept delivers better efficiency and cost savings: Interfaces to external planners can be reduced and production costs and project run times can be minimised. Resources of all kinds are optimally used.\n\nThe success of the nyoo concept is demonstrated not only by the first projects completed using this approach but also by initial success in urban planning competitions. The \"DUS 19\" project in Dusseldorf-Unterbach, with a total of 80% subsidised housing, and \"DUI 76\" in Duisburg-Buchholz were both completed in the middle of 2023 and have been successfully handed over to the long-term portfolio holders. The \"DUI 06\" project in Duisburg-Wedau is still in the planning phase. In North Rhine-Westphalia's largest urban development project to date, \"6-Seen-Wedau\", the nyoo concept won over the jury in the concept tendering procedure and was awarded two plots with the potential for around 185 residential units in 2022. Over the coming years, nyoo will develop more than 1,000 residential units in total, including the project in Duisburg – a significant contribution to increasing affordable housing.\n\nNormally, nyoo undertakes project development for institutional clients as well as private and municipal housing companies using a trading development model.1 In addition to this model, nyoo offers its services under a general contractor model.<sup>2</sup> This expands the Instone Group's affordable housing portfolio whilst also creating an offering for B2B clients and residential portfolio holders.\n\nAs well these opportunities, there is also a risk: Upon selling, nyoo gives responsibility for setting rents for all but the subsidised and pricecontrolled residential units to the buyer and thus no longer has any control over rental prices. At this point, it can no longer be ensured that the cost savings generated for the buyer by the optimised nyoo concept are passed on to the tenan[t. GRI 203, 203-1](#page-287-0)\n\n<sup>1</sup> The project development process takes place at the own expense of the project developer. The marketing risk is borne by the project developer itself.\n\n<sup>2</sup> A general contractor (GC) is responsible for all planning and engineering services as well as construction services for an owner under a works contract. The GC is free to award contracts to sub-contractors to provide the actual services. In the case of a project involving a TÜ, there is only one contract and contact person who hands over a turnkey property to the client on a contractually agreed date.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Development of neighbourhoods (S6) | Social commitment (S7)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDuring the early acquisition and planning permissions procurement phase, the Instone Group is in regular contact with cities and communities to establish meaningful added value above and beyond the urban development agreements. Early dialogue between all stakeholders, for example through innovative participation processes and the results of a careful site analysis, form the basis for needsbased neighbourhood development.\n\nIn order to find the best solutions for both the Instone Group and the city/ municipality and the neighbourhood, our internal social impact scoring model, which we developed in-house, is a good starting point. The scoring model enables us to examine and analyse the site as a whole in order to identify potential and needs and take into account social aspects. The following action areas have been identified that require special attention in this process:\n\n- Mobility\n- Sports/recreation\n- Culture\n- Health/care\n- Services\n- Commerce/local amenities\n- Education\n- Community offerings\n\nEvery site and the surrounding infrastructure are assessed according to these action areas before and after the project development process. The scoring model is then used to gauge the efficacy of the project with regard to the measures planned and the resulting social impact. A kit of best practice examples also provides creative ideas and solutions for meeting the identified needs of the site. The goal is to design new, attractive living space whilst also remaining cost-effective and sustainable. This is why the Instone Group factors the costs for developing sustainable energy and mobility concepts, for example, into its purchase estimate along with the \"classic parameters\" – the same goes for measures and activities to promote social interaction in a neighbourhoo[d.

A positive client experience as well as client satisfaction and loyalty are crucial to the Group's successful and sustainable growth. The topic \"Client satisfaction\" was identified in the materiality analysis as having double materiality.\n\nOn this basis, the Company established an exchange format (Vertical \"Client\") in the first quarter of the year. A systematic exchange on how to deal with enduser requirements takes place within the framework of regular work meetings. This is intended to further promote the continuous improvement and harmonisation of the initiatives initiated by the individual departments with regard to the customer experience. Firm fixtures of this exchange format are representatives from Corporate Marketing, Digital Strategy & Project Office – which oversees the digital solutions facing our buyers (e.g. the client portal and the customer relationship management software) – and management. Other operations employees join this group depending on the topic, for example from Client Management and Sales. Concrete measures resulting from these meetings which are currently being implemented include the redesign of our website and the revision of the client portal. The measures are intended to help optimise processes and thus improve the client experience.\n\nWith regard to the term \"client\", this section differentiates between \"institutional clients\" and \"end users\". These two groups of stakeholders have different priorities and motivations when it comes to sustainability, so they require a different assessment approach.\n\nInstitutional clients, particularly those in the financial sector, increasingly focus on a project's ESG concept as a whole and the company's ESG strategy. There is a particular focus on the aspect of climate change mitigation. This target group shows increased interest in documented sustainable building certifications (e.g. DGNB certifications) and in compliance with EU taxonomy requirements. The Instone Group keenly recognises that institutional clients' criteria relate in particular to the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the Principles for Adverse Impact, which constitute the basis for Article -8 and -9 fund products (sustainable and impact funds). With their long-term investment horizons, institutional clients have expressed to their clients a commitment to taking on far-reaching, voluntary obligations and targets, such as climate neutrality. Regulations are another key driver in this respect. The result is demand for increasingly green and sustainable assets in order to meet ambitious (climate) targets and minimise business risks from non-sustainable operations.\n\nThe topic of climate change is also important to end users. The difference, however, is that end users are more interested in a balanced cost ratio/the affordability of housing, which can also be achieved, for instance, by the unit having high energy efficiency and, as a result, lower operating costs (potentially higher purchase costs for the [new] unit amortised by longterm savings from greater energy efficiency compared to existing real estate, for example).\n\nThe operational branches and the Management Board are primarily responsible for managing the material topic in this action area. As part of their due diligence, they assume responsibility for planning and implementing measures for the material topic for clients and end users, and come to an agreement in accordance with the governance concept (se[e page 120\\). T](#page-119-0)he sustainability working groups also discuss the needs of clients and end users.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n#### **Client and end user measures TABLE 019**\n\nTABLE U\n\n| To our shareholders |  |  |  |\n|---------------------|--|--|--|\n|                     |  |  |  |\n\n**[management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)** \n\nRisk and\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n| Material topic      | Measure                                                                                      | Degree of<br>implementation |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Client satisfaction | Review of the feasibility of client preferences in the Instone Group's planning requirements | In progress                 |\n| Client satisfaction | Revision of the digital client survey concept to increase survey participation rates         | In progress                 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The degree of implementation is broken down into three stages as follows: 1) In planning: Decision has been made to implement the measure; 2) In progress: Work is already proceeding to implement the measure; 3) Implemented: The measure has already been included in standard processes, e.g. in guidelines and work equipment.\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\nThe Instone Group obtains information about clients' preferences and requirements through a continuous dialogue. Whilst institutional clients are managed by a single contact, such as a branch manager, the management or the Management Board, end users are supported by employees from Client Management or Sales during the buying process. In addition to in-person dialogue, the Instone Group conducts systematic, anonymous client satisfaction surveys of end users. The results of these surveys provide important information on end users' expectations, needs and perceptions, and are used for quality assurance and quality improvement purposes when making strategic decisions.\n\nThese client satisfaction surveys are conducted because client satisfaction is important to the Instone Group as a higher-level indicator for a benchmark amongst projects and for the Company overall. The Management Board decided in 2022 that an indicator of less than 2.4 (on a scale of 1 – very satisfied to 5 – not at all satisfied) can be taken to mean the client is satisfied. The indicator for client satisfaction for the projects handed over to end users in 2023 is 1.3 (result of a total of 37 survey responses). A high level of customer satisfaction can be derived from this result. Compared to the previous year, the value continued to increase (previous year: 1.7; result of a total of 67 survey responses). The surveys were carried out during the handover of the apartment.\n\nTo increase the participation rate and improve the interpretability and usability of the results, the concept of this digital client satisfaction survey was revised in the reporting year and divided into various topics. Beginning in 2024, feedback will also be obtained at two different times:\n\n1) After notarisation\n\n#### 2) After handover\n\nWhilst the first part of the survey focuses on **questions about the decision to buy**, the second part asks about **quality of service, willingness to recommend to others and an overall rating (indicator of client satisfaction)**. The client satisfaction indicator remains comparable in the new client satisfaction survey, since the question about satisfaction has not been altered. Since the change, the Corporate Marketing Department has been responsible for interpreting the survey. This means that the results can be analysed by a single department across all projects.\n\nThe Instone Group's goal is for the client to evaluate the process and their experience as soon as possible and to obtain a more differentiated view of the various process steps and departmental elements to produce valid results that we can then factor into decisionmaking and selection processes in order to optimise future activities.\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/22 description: The image contains two blue arrows.

The Group does this by examining the regulatory and market-driven requirements of institutional clients in detail and anticipating any resulting demands on the product. To that end, the Instone Group holds regular talks and meetings with institutional clients.\n\nWith regard to the preferred standard of living, the Instone Group responds to the demand of both end users and institutional clients to make units increasingly adaptable to accommodate different phases of life. This can be seen in the following characteristics in particular when planning projects:\n\n- Intelligent floor plans suitable for families with children, couples or single persons,\n- Accessible design within apartments and in communal areas as well as outside, which will ensure the infrastructure is sustainable and there is age-appropriate housing for the growing older population segment,\n- Energy efficiency and, ideally, no use of fossil fuels.\n\nThe Instone Group strives to achieve the highest possible satisfaction in every client group and to accommodate the needs of life into housing in the best possible way.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n<span id=\"page-119-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**[management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n### **Governance**\n\n# **Governance, risk management and internal control system**\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nRelevance of governance processes for the strategy, business model and organisation of the Instone Group  [GRI 2-9](#page-286-0)\n\nDetailed information on corporate governance and the principles of corporate governance at the Instone Group, particularly the cooperation between the Management Board and Supervisory Board, the composition of both Boards, and compliance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE is available in the corporate governance statement, which can be found in the combined management report o[n page 182 et seqq.](#page-181-0) \n\nIn preparation for the future requirements of the CSRD/ESRS, the operational managers and employees were included to a greater degree in the past financial year (see section \"Strategy and business model[\" page 50\\).](#page-49-0) This is also reflected in an expanded governance structure. In addition to established formats such as the Sustainability Committee, two other bodies have been formed to address and decide how to implement sustainability aspects, particularly at the project level:\n\n- Investment Committee (comprising all members of the Management Board and management) acts as a research body for examining and making decisions on topics that affect the Instone Group's project work\n- Branch Leadership team (comprising all members of the Management Board, management and branch managers) – responsible for exchanging ideas and assessing needs\n\nAs developments and the growing importance of sustainability dictate, the duties of the Sustainability Department have also grown. The department is now ultimately responsible for sustainability topics at the company and project level, and consolidates the topics in a multi-disciplinary manner.\n\n#### Governance concept structur[e TCFD governance](#page-289-0)\n\n#### Governance bodies\n\nBelow is a description of the duties, responsibilities and roles that are part of sustainability governance across all topics and bodies.

The Supervisory Board currently consists of six members. While the Management Board manages the Company, the Supervisory Board performs an advisory and monitoring function. Given the high relevance of the topic for the Instone Group, the Sustainability Department reports directly to the Management Board.\n\nFollowing the decision of the 2023 Annual General Meeting to add another person, the Supervisory Board of the Instone Group now has six members. The Annual General Meeting elected Sabine Georgi (currently Managing Director of ULI e.V.) to this newly created position on the Supervisory Board. Given her expertise and experience, Ms Georgi will focus on the topic of sustainability on the Supervisory Board and advise the Company on this matter.

Especially in the above exchange formats (Investment Committee and Branch Leadership team), they play a key role in implementing sustainability topics at the project level. They also discuss requirements and address new topics. As the main interface for sustainability topics at company and project level, the Sustainability department routinely reports on progress made towards achieving goals and takes on new requirements.\n\n#### **Sustainability department ( )**\n\nThe establishment of this department in 2021 laid the foundation for sustainability at the Instone Group. Comprehensive processes have been established for sustainability reporting, regulatory compliance and data management and are constantly being refined. The employees in the Sustainability department act as contacts for this specific topic and as the monitoring body for the recording of sustainability data in the Company, for example for sustainability and taxonomy reporting.\n\nThe department's duties have also grown in the past year to include the implementation of sustainability aspects in business operations. The Sustainability department now also acts as the main interface between the company and project levels. It actively helps shape the sustainable transformation of the Instone Group through activities such as initiating and leading company-wide working and discussion groups, and consolidates the topics in an overarching manner. In this way, whilst regulatory requirements are imposed on business operations, practical solutions are also developed that make a significant contribution to the achieving of targets, such as those on the path to climate neutrality by 2045. The department is also a source of company-wide knowledge and makes this information available to all employees. One example in this regard is the Company's Intranet, which was developed in-house and contains every finding from the current working groups on the topic of sustainability. An extensive media pool contains tangible work results as well as company-wide collections of best practices, checklists and guidelines. Operational sustainability topics in particular are also presented and discussed at regular expert meetings (such as the project developers' meeting) and regular branch meetings.\n\n#### **Sustainability Committee ( )**\n\nThe Sustainability department chairs the quarterly meeting of the Sustainability Committee on the communication, updating and preparation of decisions with cross-departmental implications. Each year, the committee addresses progress in achieving set sustainability targets, particularly the reduction of GHG emissions as part of our scientific climate target validated by the SBTi. Proposals for new targets or adjustments to targets introduced by the Sustainability department and, if applicable, other affected departments are discussed in connection with setting sustainability targets. Also discussed are the effectiveness and feasibility of measures and their implementation, though, as described above, the final decision lies with the CEO.\n\n#### **Operational working groups on sustainability topics**\n\nSince the end of 2022, five working groups with over 30 employees have been working hard to operationalise sustainability targets and establish them in practice. The groups' specific goals are derived from the topics identified by the Instone Group in its materiality analysis. They develop proposals for practical solutions and create guidelines for the Instone Group's future operations.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Presentation of the governance structure for sustainability topics**\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of an organizational structure. At the top is a blue rectangle labeled \"Supervisory Board.\" Below that is a black rectangle labeled \"Decision Level.\" Below that is a gray rectangle labeled \"Management Board.\" Below the Management Board are two blue rectangles. The rectangle on the left is labeled \"Implementation\" and has the following bullet points below it: \"Sustainability Committee,\" \"Management,\" \"Departments,\" and \"Working groups.\" The rectangle on the right is labeled \"Strategy and reporting\" and has \"Sustainability department\" below it. Arrows indicate the relationships between the different levels of the organization.\n\n**FIGURE 014**\n\n**Examples of governance structures in the implementation of topic-specific measures for environment and social issues1**\n\nAs part of the identification of material topics, we identified which topics have materiality and which have double materiality in the financial year 2022. Based on this, we performed a due diligence assessment of the impacts as well as the risks and opportunities under the direction of the Sustainability department and with the involvement of other relevant departments. In doing so, we recorded existing measures and added new measures in some cases.\n\nThe defined measures for each action area can be divided into two areas of responsibility. The first area relates to measures that can be implemented via corporate departments (such as Legal or Purchasing) for the Instone Group's business as a whole. These include contractual requirements for the Instone Group's contractual partners and checks to determine that they have been implemented, for instance in relation to compliance with the KrWG or environment-related provisions for construction site equipment. While the Sustainability department initiates the changes, the corporate department is responsible for implementation and verification. The Sustainability department records progress with the measures in its reporting. Progress is also discussed in the Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe second area relates to measures that are purely project-specific and thus fall under the responsibility of that project's manager. An example of this is compliance with biodiversity requirements when initiating projects, planning them and during construction. The Sustainability department is also involved here in the initiation of measures and raising employees' awareness of these measures. The measures are monitored in regular site discussions between the project managers and the respective contractual partners on the construction site, and are documented in minutes of the discussions. Operational working groups develop concrete measures in order to share learning outcomes across different sites, constantly improve project teams' sustainability skills and scale up innovative approaches and ideas.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Policies, work instructions and documentation**\n\nimposed requirements (list not exhaustive).\n\n• Code of Conduct for employees\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n• Code of Conduct for contractual partners • Accounting policy • Materiality analysis policy • Guideline and form for project-specific data collection for the EU taxonomy and associated sources • Building specification • Site regulations • Occupational health and safety information from the industry's\n\nThe following policies, working materials and guidelines exist in relation to the implementation of the sustainability strategy and the achievement of the targets set, and are amended as needed to newly\n\n- accident prevention and insurance association\n- Integration of technical rules for hazardous materials (TRGS)\n- Integration guideline for off-road machinery and equipment\n- Contracts with contractual partners and employees\n- Works contract for single or general contracts\n- ESG process documentation\n- Process documentation for GHG accounting\n- Process documentation for scenario analysis\n- Investment application template\n- Planning requirements\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Risk management, due diligence and internal control system\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nBased on the materiality analysis, the Instone Group has defined processes in place to ensure risk management and ongoing due diligence. Internal controls as part of the company-wide risk management system and a quarterly review by the Sustainability Committee ensure activities are conducted in the proper manner. An example of the process is illustrated in the following graphic.\n\nImage /page/123/Figure/17 description: This image is a figure titled \"Ensuring due diligence FIGURE 015\". It is a flow chart with four steps. Step 1 is \"Materiality analysis\" and includes the following sub-points: Identification of material topics incl. assessment, Impacts; risks & opportunities, Development of measures for topics and responsibilities, and Development of targets to ensure measurability. Step 2 is \"Work on the content of material topics\" and includes two sub-points: Material topics (non-financial) and Material topics (financial). It also includes the following sub-points: Implementation of measures and solutions, monitoring of opportunities and risks: in working groups and in departments. Step 3 is \"Ongoing monitoring by Sustainability department\" and includes a graphic of a circular arrow. It also includes the sub-point: Regular meeting with working groups and departments. Step 3 also has an arrow pointing to it from the text \"RMS process as per risk policy -> Inclusion of financial risks and determination of responsibilities\". Step 4 is \"Management and monitoring by Sustainability Committee\" and includes the following sub-points: Quarterly review of progress towards achieving set sustainability targets: Suggestions for new targets or changes to existing targets (table of targets) and Effectiveness and feasibility of measures as well as their implementation (table of measures).

The quarterly monitoring of the topics is conducted in the risk report.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee performs a quarterly review of the progress made towards achieving the set sustainability targets. Suggestions for new targets and/or changes to existing targets are discussed and the effectiveness and feasibility of measures as well as their implementation are examined.\n\nThe results of the review, the list of intended measures as well as associated and qualified impacts, risks and opportunities are submitted to the Management Board for final review at the end of the due diligence process and once every step of the materiality analysis is complete. If a change is made, it is documented accordingly and the final list of approved material topics, including estimates of impact, risks and opportunities as well as action plans, is approved. Progress on the measures is documented in the annual report.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Sustainable corporate governance**\n\n- **MATERIAL TOPICS\\* IN THIS SECTION:**\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n\\* Doubly material topics are outlined in orange.\n\n#### Strategy and materiality\n\nA description of the key principles of corporate governance and culture and associated policies is provided in the general section on governance processes in the management report o[n page 182 et seqq.](#page-181-0) \n\nIn terms of the integration of sustainability aspects into corporate governance, the focus this past year was primarily on increasing the standardisation of electronic data collection and processing for key sustainability figures. Further formalising data collection and integrating it into the existing process landscape is an important goal, especially with regard to CSRD/ESRS requirements. The integration of the key sustainability figures into investment decisions and sales approvals demonstrates how relevant they are. The new processes enable (project) decisions to be made based on data whilst also ensuring that business practices are aligned with sustainable targets. Responsibilities and approval and control processes (ICS) have been defined as part of the expansion of the structured recording of relevant key sustainability figures, especially at project level. The Sustainability department is responsible for initiating/monitoring the overall process.\n\nThe Instone Group regularly audits compliance with contractual partner requirements, required proof of good standing and compliance with minimum wage laws, as well as the daily site diaries. Compliance with Instone Group policies and regulations, which include compliance with ESG criteria in addition to technical, professional and legal requirements, play an increasingly central role (Business ethics, G2).\n\nThe Management Board has laid down the fundamental values of lawful, ethical conduct in a Group-wide Code of Conduct for employees and contractual partners. This specifies the Instone Group's understanding of business ethics as well as applicable duties and responsibilities and establishes standards of conduct. It provides employees and contractual partners with guidance in their daily work and contains binding requirements for their conduct.\n\nCompliance with the Code of Conduct and other provisions aims to protect the Instone Group from losses resulting, for example, from corruption, money laundering, unfair competition, abuse of power, violations of employee rights (including by contractual partners), greenwashing, or violations of other laws and regulations.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Measures and implementation\n\nSustainable corporate governance is ensured by the governance processes (se[e page 182 et seqq. of](#page-181-0) the management report). This means no further measures are required for compliance. The implementation of the material topics is described further and specified below.\n\n#### **Economic development of the company (G1 )**\n\nThe \"Economic development of the company\" was identified in the materiality analysis as a topic with double materiality. The economic report o[n page 129 et seqq. c](#page-128-0)ontains detailed information on this subject. The key points of the strategy and the future prospects of the Company are described here. The resulting risks and opportunities can also be found in the risk and opportunities report on [page 156 et seqq..](#page-155-0) \n\n#### **Payment behaviour (towards contractors) (G8 )**\n\nIn addition to transparent communication, compliance with agreed payment terms is crucial to establishing trust. As a reliable partner, the Instone Group normally makes a contractual commitment to make payment within 14 to 30 days of invoice receipt, depending on the agreement. The Instone Group generally meets the agreed payment deadlines. This is an important basis for trusting cooperation between the Instone Group, as customer, and its contractual partners.\n\nRisks relating to contractual partners resulting from the current situation are addressed in the risk and opportunity management section of the management repor[t. page 168](#page-167-0)\n\n#### **Respect for human rights (S11) | Business ethics – compliance with social and ethical criteria (G2)**\n\nRespect for human rights is a vital part of the Instone Group's responsible corporate governance. In its declaration on human rights, diversity and freedom of association released in the past financial year, the Instone Group expressly committed itself to respecting human rights. The Company believes that all humans are endowed with equal and inalienable rights from birth. Every person deserves respect, dignity and the chance to live free of discrimination. The Instone Group condemns all forms of injustice, oppression and violence against fellow human beings.\n\nThe Instone Group expects and requires complete and total respect for human rights along the entire value chain, internally and externally, at all times. The fundamental values of lawful and ethical conduct are defined in the Instone Group's Code of Conduct for contractual partners and employees and are derived from the duties and responsibilities prescribed by law or official regulations and the Instone Group's understanding of the matter. These are used to establish standards of conduct. All employees/contractual partners receive the Code of Conduct as an annex to their contract form (G2). It provides employees, service providers and contractual partners with guidance in their dayto-day work and conduct. If the Instone Group becomes aware of any non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, a review will be initiated and appropriate action considered. For contractual partners, the Legal, HR and Purchasing departments are responsible for reviewing these matters and deciding what action to take. Information on the number of incidents/complaints is shown i[n table 004.](#page-66-0)\n\n#### **Compliance/anti-corruption measures (G4)**\n\nAt the Instone Group, compliance is an integral part (impact dimension) of responsible corporate governance. The central compliance organisation sees itself as a key contributor to an integrity-led corporate governance and culture.\n\nManagement of the material topics in this action area is primarily the responsibility of the Legal Department, which undertakes the planning and implementation of measures for material topics in the areas of compliance, anti-corruption and the prevention of money-laundering as part of a due diligence process and coordinates with the Sustainability Department and committee on relevant topics in accordance with the governance concept.\n\nThe goal of the Group-wide compliance management system is to prevent violations of applicable laws and internal policies, and to protect the Instone Group and its employees from inappropriate and unlawful conduct. The key pillars of the compliance management system include the welldeveloped compliance culture, in particular the whistleblower system, and the compliance programme, which includes measures that are used to avoid and mitigate compliance risks.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n **[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)**\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe whistleblower system offers employees and third parties the opportunity to report potential violations of rules or laws by employees to the Instone Group. Each report is examined and followed up systematically in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- The process is fair,\n- The whistleblower's anonymity is protected,\n- Investigations are confidential and\n- Processes are efficient and protected.\n\nA digital whistleblower system and direct contact with the Compliance Officer are options available to those looking to report misconduct.\n\nLikewise, under no circumstances is corruption tolerated by the Instone Group, neither on the part of business partners or third parties nor on the part of the Company's own employees. Corruption cases are consistently investigated without exception in order to protect employees and the Compan[y. GRI 205-3](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Instone Group also does not allow transactions with the Company to be misused for the purposes of money laundering or the financing of terrorism. The Company rejects any transaction in which a third party benefits from a criminal act. The Instone Group has therefore put in place special preventive measures as part of its compliance programme, to be taken on a routine basis or as the need arises, to detect and combat such suspicions. These measures include:\n\n- Due diligence of business partners for compliance risks,\n- Due diligence around suspected money laundering,\n- Checking of potential business partners against sanctions lists and\n- Verification of banking information in payment transactions with business partners and clients.\n\nThe Instone Group is involved in various initiatives, associations and organisations. In some cases, the Company's employees perform representative duties. The principles of responsible corporate governance are also ensured in this regard: No financial resources beyond normal membership fees are provided[.

According to the Federal Statistical Office, priceadjusted gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 0.3% in 2023. As a result, development in Germany fell short of development in the other major economies in the EU, the USA or China.\n\nThe main factors were the long-term weak order books, which is likely to have had an increasing impact on industrial production. In addition, increased financing costs and the expiry of the environmental bonus dampened investments. The increase in interest rates and the poor weather with high rainfall also weighed on construction production and investment.\n\nFor 2024, the Deutsche Bundesbank expects a moderate recovery of the German economy and moderate GDP growth of 0.4%. The Bundesbank assumes that expanding international markets will have a positive impact on export demand and that falling inflation combined with significant wage increases should have positive effects on private consumer demand. The Bundesbank expects German GDP growth to accelerate slightly to +1.2% in 2025.\n\n#### **The labour market remains stable**\n\nThe labour market remained robust despite the difficult economic environment.\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office, the average number of people in employment in Germany continued to rise by an average of 333,000 people (+0.7%) despite the decline in economic output, reaching a new record level with an average of 45.9 million employees. The reasons for this increase included the immigration of foreign workers and the increase in the employment of the domestic population. According to the Federal Employment Agency, the unemployment rate in Germany rose slightly year-on-year to 5.7% in December 2023 (previous year: 5.3%). This increase was particularly due to Ukrainian refugee migration. The Federal Agency assumes that this effect accounts for 0.4 percentage points.\n\nThe Bundesbank assumes that this high level of employment can be maintained in 2024. However, due to the increased level of refugees, this can lead to an average annual increase in registered unemployed.\n\n#### **Inflation remains high but declining**\n\nThe development of inflation was also one of the most important economic parameters in 2023. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the average increase in consumer prices in Germany in 2023 was 5.9% (previous year: 6.9%). The inflation rate therefore remained at a consistently high level. The impact of geopolitical crises remains noticeable in this respect. Following the sharp rise in energy costs in the previous year, food prices were a major cost driver in 2023 and underwent increases of an average of 12.4% year-on-year. However, the rate of inflation showed a marked downward trend over the course of the year. Even though the inflation rate rose again in December compared to the previous month, at 3.7% by the end of the year it was already well below the average level for the year as a whole.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nTo contain inflation, international central banks relied on the continuation of restrictive monetary policy with further interest rate increases.\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank expects inflation to fall further to 2.7% for the 2024 average for the year. As labour costs continue to rise, a reduction in the price pressure on food and energy raw materials should contribute to this.\n\n### **A further rise in interest rates on housing loans has a significant negative impact on credit demand**\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has continued to raise interest rates significantly from 2.5% at the end of 2022 to 4.5% by September 2023 in several interest rate steps. This coincided with an increase in long-term interest rates. According to the Deutsche Bundesbank, the average effective interest rate for housing loans granted to private households rose from 3.6% in December 2022 to 4.12% in December 2023. At the end of 2021, the comparable interest rate was 1.34%.\n\nThe further increase in financing costs had an increasingly negative impact on the affordability of real estate and therefore on demand for real estate loans in the course of 2023. According to the Deutsche Bundesbank the volume of newly issued real estate loans from German banks to private households fell to around €161 billion in 2023 – a significant decrease compared to around €257 billion in the same period of the previous year (37.4%).\n\n### **Population in Germany increased again**\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office, 84.6 million people lived in Germany as of 30 September 2023. This corresponds to a population increase of 336,000 people (+0.4%) year-on-year. The population of Germany has therefore reached a new peak. However, the rate of increase has weakened compared to 2022. Due to the refugee migration following the war in Ukraine, the increase in the population in 2022 amounted to around 1.1 million people. This positive development is driven exclusively by net immigration, whereas the surplus of deaths compared to births had a negative impact on population development. Since the early 1970s, deaths in Germany have exceeded births.\n\nThe development of the number of households is the most important demand determinant for demand for housing. Several social developments have ensured that this figure has increased disproportionately compared to population development in recent years. According to the Federal Statistical Office, while the population grew by only 2.5% between 2000 and 2022, the number of households increased by 8.5% over the same period. This is largely driven by the increase in the share of single-person households, which rose from 35.8% to 40.8% during this period. One reason for this is, for example, the increasing number of people living alone (singularisation) due, among other things, to increasing life expectancy. The Federal Statistical Office expects a further increase in the share of single-person households by 2040.\n\nAs a result of these factors, there will also be an increase in demand for housing in German cities with good infrastructure in the coming years.\n\n#### **Building permits and completions are declining**\n\nFrom January to November 2023, the number of building permits in Germany fell by 25.9% compared to the previous year to a total of 238,500 homes. This includes both new builds and new homes in existing buildings. In the new construction sector, permits for single and two-family homes in particular fell drastically by 38.6% and 49.2%, respectively, while in the case of multi-family homes there was a drop of 23.8%.\n\nThis development also indicates a significant decline in construction work. While in 2022 some 295,000 apartments were completed in Germany, the ifo Institute only expects 245,000 homes to be completed in 2023 and 2025 out of 200,000. This is a clear failure to meet the federal government's target of 400,000 new homes per year.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Crisis exacerbates housing shortage**\n\nThe rising demand for housing as a result of the positive development of households and the population as well as the continuing decline in the supply of new housing is exacerbating the housing shortage in Germany. A study by the Pestel Institute found that more than 700,000 additional homes were required in Germany in 2023. This is the biggest housing deficit in more than 20 years. The shortage is increasing all the time, particularly where affordable housing is concerned.\n\nThe continued reduction in vacant housing also reflects the scarcity in the housing market. This is shown in the data from the current CBRE empirica vacancy index. At the end of 2022, the market-active vacancy rate, in other words apartment blocks that can be rented directly or capitalised in the medium-term, was 2.5% (previous year: 2.8%). As a result, the absolute vacancy rate fell significantly year-on-year by around 53,000 to around 554,000 homes (previous year: 607,000 homes). For the first time in 22 years, there has been no increase in one of the 400 areas analysed. The lowest rate remained unchanged in Munich with 0.1%, followed by Frankfurt am Main, Münster and Freiburg at 0.2% each.\n\n### **Comparatively moderate declines in new housing prices in 2023**\n\nPrices for newly built residential units in Germany in the top 7 cities fell moderately in 2023. According to data from the consultancy company bulwiengesa, the average price development in the individual cities was around 4%. According to bulwiengesa, the cities of Stuttgart and Munich have the most stable development in this respect, while the price declines in Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main have been somewhat stronger.\n\nFor 2024, we expect prices for new build properties to stabilise in Germany's most attractive metropolitan regions as supply is still very low in these regions and this will be offset by a substantial and growing demand surplus. This is also reflected in the sustainable positive development of rents. The high energy efficiency of new buildings is another factor stabilising the prices of our products. Non-renovated old buildings have lost more value.\n\nThere continues to be a clear upward trend in rents. The continuing high demand for rental homes is due to a lack of affordable supply. Net immigration and declining new construction activity are exacerbating the shortage. In addition to cold rents, ancillary costs have also increased enormously as a result of the energy crisis, which has led to a significant cost burden for tenants. This has triggered additional demand pressure from tenants for energy-efficient apartments and thus new buildings.\n\nAccording to bulwiengesa, first-time rents for new buildings in Germany increased by an average of 4.3% in the top 7 cities in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Overall statement on the financial year**\n\n**2023 financial year: Instone Group achieves annual** \n\nDespite a crisis in the housing development sector in 2023, the Instone Real Estate Group SE was able to hold its own in a difficult overall economic environment and achieve all its financial targets for the 2023\n\nThe sharp rise in interest rates led to a significant decline in private and institutional demand and to a deterioration in financing conditions in the sector. The further increase in construction costs – even if this weakened over the course of the year – also had a negative impact on project margins. In this environment, the Instone Group benefited from a high number of projects already sold. The continuing high gross margin is also strongly attributable to its own expertise in construction management and the associated stringent cost discipline, which is a distinguishing feature of\n\n**targets in a difficult industry environment**\n\nthe company compared to many of its competitors.\n\nThe decrease in its project portfolio by 31 December 2023 to €6,972.0 million (previous year: €7,668.8 million) was the result of disposals due to completion in the amount of €493.2 million and revaluations and the effects of the deconsolidation of a project in the amount of €203.6 million. Adjusted group sales fell by around 1% to €616.0 million as a result of the interest rate-induced decline in demand (previous year: €621.0 million). Adjusted earnings after tax (EAT) were down slightly on the previous year at €48.2 million (previous year: €50.0 million). The improved result of equity investments was almost completely compensated by the increase in platform costs. At €76.5 million, total platform costs were below our original expectations for the 2023\n\nfinancial year.\n\nfinancial year.\n\nOperating cash flow before payments for land acquisitions amounted to €118,1 million despite the decline in consolidated net income and extensive tax payments due to the positive change in net working capital before land purchases (previous year: €187.2 million).\n\n#### **Comparison of actual and forecasted development**\n\n| Comparison of actual and forecasted development in 2023 |      |                | TABLE 020  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------|----------------|------------|\n| In millions of euros                                    |      |                |            |\n|                                                         |      | Actual<br>2023 | Forecast   |\n| Revenue (adjusted)                                      |      | 616.0          | 600 to 700 |\n| Gross profit margin (adjusted)                          | In % | 25.1           | ~ 25       |\n| Earnings after tax (EAT) (adjusted)                     |      | 48.2           | 40-50      |\n| Volume of sales contracts                               |      | 211.4          | >150       |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Summary Management Report 2022, page 169.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-132-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Results of operations, net assets and financial position**\n\n| Cumulative financial key performance indicators |       |       | TABLE 021      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                            |       |       |                |\n|                                                 | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>In % |\n| Revenues adjusted1                              | 616.0 | 621.0 | -0.8           |\n| Gross profit adjusted                           | 154.5 | 157.2 | -1.7           |\n| Gross profit margin adjusted1<br>In %           | 25.1  | 25.3  |                |\n| EBIT adjusted                                   | 86.1  | 88.6  | -2.8           |\n| EBT adjusted                                    | 71.2  | 72.7  | -2.1           |\n| EAT adjusted1                                   | 48.2  | 50.0  | -3.6           |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Financial performance indicators.\n\n#### **Results of operations**\n\nTo present the results of operations, some items in the income statement are combined into new items:\n\n- → Cost of materials, changes in inventories and one-off expenses related to the valuation of inventories are covered by the Project costs item.\n- → The gross profit item is the balance of revenue and project costs.\n- → Other operating income, staff costs as well as other operating expenses and depreciation and amortisation are summarised under the heading Platform costs.\n\n→ The consolidated earnings from operating activities and share of results of joint ventures form earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).\n\nThe profit figure shows all income as positive and all expenses as negative.\n\nFrom the results of operations, the following adjustments are made to the adjusted results of operations, which are relevant from the point of view of the Management of the Instone Group:\n\nAs part of the adjusted results of operations of the Instone Group, revenue recognition will continue to reflect share deals and asset deals in the same way and similarly in accordance with IFRS 15, irrespective of a decision by the IFRS IC to exempt share deals from revenue recognition over time under IFRS 15.\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax are intended to reflect the sustained profitability and are thus adjusted for non-recurring effects relating to other periods.

Despite continuing construction activity, the significantly reduced purchases of land plots resulted in a reduction in the cost of materials to €-544.5 million (previous year: €-551.2 million). The increase in inventories to €167.6 million (previous year: €123.5 million) reflects the increasing progress of construction in projects that are not sold or that are sold in the form of a share deal.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, one-off expenses relating to the valuation of inventories in the amount of €-17.7 million were recorded in project costs. These expenses result from the rescheduling of projects due to the continuing difficult conditions in the industry and general economic environment in Germany and the need to replan individual projects. These expenses are unusual in their amount and cannot be regarded as recurring on a regular basis. For this reason, these are adjusted as non-recurring effects.\n\nIndirect sales expenses in the amount of €-2.5 million (previous year: €-2.8 million) and material cost-related other operating income of €15.1 million (previous year: €10.2 million), of which €13.4 million from grants, were allocated to adjusted project costs as of 31 December 2023. The adjustment of the capitalised interest in the changes in inventories of €-12.2 million (previous year: €-3.2 million) were was added to the adjusted project costs. Effects from the amortisation of purchase price allocations reduced adjusted project costs by €3.0 million (previous year: €10.3 million). Due to the separate valuation of share deals, adjusted project costs again increased by €-88.0 million (previous year: €-50.6 million).\n\n| Project costs                             |        |        | TABLE 024      |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |        |        |                |\n|                                           | 2023   | 2022   | Change<br>in % |\n| Project costs                             | -394.6 | -427.6 | -7.7           |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations | 3.0    | 10.3   | -70.9          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          | 0.5    | 4.1    | -87.8          |\n| + non recurring effects                   | 17.7   | 0.0    | 0.0            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      | -88.0  | -50.6  | 73.9           |\n| Project costs adjusted                    | -461.5 | -463.8 | -0.5           |\n\n#### Gross profit\n\nAdjusted gross profit declined to €154.5 million as a result of the heavier fall in revenue compared to project costs during the financial year and due to the lower project gross profit margin (previous year: €157.2 million) compared with the previous year.\n\n| Gross profit                              |       |       | TABLE 025      |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |       |       |                |\n|                                           | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| Gross profit                              | 119.6 | 139.9 | -14.5          |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations | 5.6   | 14.3  | -60.8          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          | 0.5   | 4.1   | -87.8          |\n| + non recurring effects                   | 17.7  | 0.0   | 0.0            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      | 11.1  | -1.1  | n/a            |\n| Gross profit adjusted                     | 154.5 | 157.2 | -1.7           |\n\nThe adjusted gross profit margin – calculated from the adjusted gross profit relating to the adjusted revenue – amounted to 25.1% (previous year: 25.3%).

In terms of costs, the measures introduced to increase efficiency will contribute to a noticeable reduction in platform costs. This enabled us to achieve the goal of reducing the ongoing annualised platform costs to around €70 million by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. In the financial year, indirect sales costs of €2.4 million and material cost-related other operating income in the amount of €15.1 million were reclassified as project costs and other non-recurring effects were adjusted in the amount of €3.8 million. These mainly relate to expenses in connection with structural reorganisation measures amounting to €2.5 million.\n\n| Platform costs                   |       |       | TABLE 026      |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros             |       |       |                |\n|                                  | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| Platform costs                   | -67.6 | -67.2 | 0.6            |\n| + effects from reclassifications | -12.7 | -7.4  | 71.6           |\n| + non recurring effects          | 3.8   | 2.1   | 81.0           |\n| Platform costs adjusted          | -76.5 | -72.5 | 5.5            |\n\nStaff costs at the end of the 2023 financial year were €-51.7 million (previous year: €-48.7 million) – a year-on-year rise of around 6%. This is mainly due to the €5.1 million increase in expenses related to performancerelated remuneration compared to the previous year[. GRI 2-7, 2-8](#page-286-0) \n\nThe reported other operating income, at €25.6 million (previous year: €17.9 million) was higher than last year. This included material cost related other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials of €15.1 million (previous year: €10.2 million), which were reclassified as project costs. Included in this are especially income from the realisation of grants of €13.4 million (previous year: €7.3 million). Income from the reversal of provisions for and liabilities relating to employees during the reporting period was below the previous year's level at €3.3 million (previous year: €3.8 million). In addition, income was realised from the reversal of provisions and project-related liabilities released in the amount of €3.5 million (previous year: €5.8 million). In addition, income of €2.8 million was reported from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.\n\nThe reported other operating expenses increased to €-36.5 million in the reporting period (previous year: €-31.6 million), mainly due to increased expenses for warranty claims for old projects (€-5.0 million) and increased expenses relating to structural reorganisation of €-2.1 million. This is offset by consulting expenses of €2.6 million and sales costs of €1.5 million. Other operating expenses mainly include costs for warranties, consulting expenses, sales costs, IT costs and court costs, solicitors' and notaries' fees.\n\nThe reported depreciation and amortisation was €-5.0 million (previous year: €-4.8 million), a slight increase compared with the previous year.\n\n#### Share of results of joint ventures\n\nThe adjusted shares of results of joint ventures of €8.1 million (previous year: €3.9 million) during the financial year was attributable almost completely to construction activities and the sale of the Berlin joint venture Friedenauer Höhe, and reflects the expected development of this project.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)\n\nIn 2023, adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell slightly compared to the previous year to €86.1 million despite the increased earnings from share of results of joint ventures compared to the previous year, essentially due to the increased platform costs and the reduced gross profit compared to the previous year (previous year: €88.6 million).\n\n| EBIT                                      |      |       |      | TABLE 027      |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|-------|------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                      |      |       |      |                |\n|                                           |      | 2023  | 2022 | Change<br>in % |\n| EBIT                                      |      | 60.1  | 76.6 | -21.5          |\n| + effects from purchase price allocations |      | 5.6   | 14.3 | -60.8          |\n| + effects from reclassifications          |      | -12.2 | -3.2 | >100.0         |\n| + non recurring effects                   |      | 21.5  | 2.1  | n/a            |\n| + effects from share deal agreements      |      | 11.1  | -1.1 | n/a            |\n| EBIT adjusted                             |      | 86.1  | 88.6 | -2.8           |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                      | In % | 14.0  | 14.3 |                |\n\n#### Investment and financial result\n\nAs in the previous year, there was no materially adjusted income from investments in the reporting period.\n\nThe reported financial result deteriorated in the financial year to €-27.1 million (previous year: €-19.1 million).

Current right of use assets in the amount of €3.0 million (previous year: €3.0 million) covers a leasehold plot intended for project development.\n\nOther current receivables and other assets decreased from €133.9 million to €74.6 million in 2023. A considerable share of these items consists largely of approved public grants of €51.6 million (previous year: €86.7 million) for the construction of buildings, including subsidy of the KfW efficiency programme. The majority of this change as at the reporting date is due to approved grants being reported in a different period for the purposes of accounting that is expected to occur between the start of sales and the start of construction. In addition, conversions of projects due to these changes were corrected according to the corresponding receivables. In addition, the decrease in the success-based income is also due to pledged public grants already being accepted. Prepayments on land for which the transfer of benefits and encumbrances takes place after the balance sheet date decreased to €14.1 million in the financial year due to a lack of new investment (previous year: €42.4 million[\\). GRI 201-4](#page-286-0)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and term deposits of €383.6 million (previous year: €255.6 million) increased mainly due to the continuous inflow of funds from ongoing project developments.

This item essentially comprises provisions for long-term incentive plans amounting to €2.7 million (previous year: €2.5 million) and other long-term personnel provisions in the amount of €0.7 million (previous year: €0.8 million).\n\nThe other short-term provisions for the financial year rose to €24.3 million in 2023 (previous year: €21.9 million). Project-related provisions for impending losses and warranty and litigation risks in financial year 2023 were €18.9 million (previous year: €16.7 million).\n\nNon-current financial liabilities increased to €396.6 million as at 31 December 2023 (previous year: €292.0 million). During the same period, current financial liabilities fell to €136.1 million (previous year: €228.6 million). The total decline in financial liabilities is due to a reduced net borrowing of financial loans in the reporting period.\n\nLeasing liabilities in the amount of €14.7 million (previous year: €10.9 million) have increased mainly due to the initial accounting of a leasehold plot intended for project development as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe increase in other non-current liabilities to €37.8 million (previous year: €0.0 million) was completely related to interest and repayment subsidy in connection with subsidised loans.\n\nTrade payables fell during the financial year to €142.2 million (previous year: €150.5 million) and mainly included the services provided by contractors. The fall corresponds to the decrease in output in the financial year and is also related to the reporting date.\n\nThe increase in other non-current liabilities to €431.9 million (previous year: €393.6 million) resulted mainly from advance payments received for the \"Westville\" project in the amount of €383.5 million (previous year: €302.5 million). The fall in liabilities from government grants in the amount of €32.4 million (previous year: €79.8 million) corresponds to the decrease in other current receivables and assets related to public funding.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDeferred tax provisions as at 31 December 2023 amounted to €44.1 million (previous year: €50.3 million).

As of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents totalling €423.3 million (previous year: €458.6 million) were available from project financing (excluding the subsided loan for the \"Westville\" project) and in the amount of €335.0 million (previous year: €348.0 million) from corporate finance. These corporate finance agreements contain financial ratios that are described in the \"Other disclosures\" section of the notes to the consolidated financial statement[s page 241.](#page-240-0)\n\nIn the balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, the liabilities from corporate finance amounted to €176,8 million (previous year: €179.7 million) and liabilities from project-related financing (including the subsidised loan for the \"Westville\" project) ) to €355.8 million (previous year: €341.0 million). Recognised total liabilities from financing operations thus fell to €532.6 million on the reporting date (previous year: €520.6 million). The current project financing included in this is composed of option agreements for extension.\n\nThe individual project financing of the Instone Group was negotiated with various financial institutions and is subject to different conditions. In general, the loans are subject to variable interest rates. Different amounts and frequencies have been agreed for the use of funds from loans with fixed interest or fixed term. The average interest margins for 2023 were at the same level as the previous year. As a result of the project financing, which is mainly subject to variable interest rates, the interest rate increases of the European Central Bank led to higher interest rates and, as a result, to higher interest expenses. The mostly variable interest rates are between 1.24% and 3.00% (previous year: between 1.24% and 3.00%) on EURIBOR and under fixed-interest contracts at a fixed interest rate between 1.15% and 6.51% (previous year: between 1.95% and 4.50%).\n\nShort-term funds needed for project-related payments can be obtained by means of overdraft facilities agreed with individual banks. To compensate for interest payments, all payments already received which the buyers of our properties pay into separately managed collective accounts for the purchase price payment are credited to these current account facilities. If necessary, these overdrafts can be converted into fixed-interest or fixedterm loans.\n\nThe maturities of the non-discounted repayment amounts are as follows:\n\n### **Financial liabilities TABLE 035**\n\nIn millions of euros\n\n#### **Corporate finance (promissory notes)**\n\n|                        | Due in | Credit<br>amount |\n|------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Term < 1 year          | 2024   | 5.0              |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years | 2025   | 100.0            |\n| Term > 2 and < 3 years | 2026   | 20.0             |\n| Term > 3 years         | 2027   | 50.0             |\n|                        |        | 175.0            |\n\n| Corporate finance (syndicated loans) |        |             | Utilisation |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023  |\n| Term < 1 year                        | 2024   | 118.3       | 0.0         |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years               | 2025   | 41.7        | 0.0         |\n|                                      |        | 160.0       | 0.0         |\n\n| Project financing      |        |             | Utilisation |\n|------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n|                        | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023  |\n| Term < 1 year          | 2024   | 133.1       | 129.0       |\n| Term > 1 and < 2 years | 2025   | 232.7       | 92.2        |\n| Term > 2 and < 3 years | 2026   | 0.0         | 0.0         |\n| Term > 3 years         | 2027   | 57.6        | 57.6        |\n|                        |        | 423.3       | 278.8       |\n\n| Project financing<br>(promotional loans for customers) |        |             | Utilisation1 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|--------------|\n|                                                        | Due in | Credit line | 31/12/2023   |\n| Term > 3 years                                         | >2026  | 199.0       | 115.9        |\n|                                                        |        | 199.0       | 115.9        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> This includes interest and repayment subsidy of €37.8 million that is recognised under other non-current liabilities.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n **Combined** \n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n|                               | Condensed statement of cash flows                           |       |       | TABLE 036      |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n|                               | In millions of euros                                        |       |       |                |\n| Our company                   |                                                             | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| To our shareholders           | Cash flow from operations                                   | 107.7 | 70.2  | 53.4           |\n| Combined<br>management report | Cash flow from investing activities                         | 11.5  | 9.4   | 22.3           |\n|                               | Free cash flow                                              | 119.2 | 79.6  | 49.7           |\n|                               | Cash flow from financing activities                         | 9.8   | 45.0  | -78.2          |\n| Foundations of the Group      | Cash change in cash and cash equivalents                    | 129.0 | 124.6 | 3.5            |\n| Sustainability report         | Cash and cash equivalents at the<br>beginning of the period | 255.6 | 131.0 | 95.6           |\n| ► Economic report             | Other changes in cash and cash<br>equivalents               | -1.0  | 0.0   | n/c            |\n|                               | Cash and cash equivalents<br>at the end of the period       | 383.6 | 255.6 | 50.1           |\n\n[opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n#### [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\nRisk and\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nCash flow from operations in the Instone Group in the amount of €107.7 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: €70.2 million) was mainly positively influenced by the increased cash flows from customer payments for ongoing projects as well as by cash flows from handovers of projects with final payment. There was a reduction of liabilities to contractors for ongoing projects with simultaneous purchase price payments and land acquisition taxes for land totalling €10.4 million (previous year: €117.0 million). In addition, income tax payments amounting to €44.3 million were made in the reporting period (previous year: €4.5 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group was able to achieve a positive overall cash flow from operations and thus strengthen its position in terms of cash and cash equivalents. The operating cash flow, adjusted for payments for land, in the period under review was distinctly positive at €118.1 million (previous year: €187.2 million). This underpins the long-term positive liquidity returns of the Instone Group from the ongoing housing project developments despite the continuing difficult industry environment.\n\n| Cash flow from operations                            |       |       | TABLE 037      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n| In millions of euros                                 |       |       |                |\n|                                                      | 2023  | 2022  | Change<br>in % |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                      | 91.1  | 93.4  | -2.5           |\n| Other non-cash items                                 | -9.5  | -20.2 | -53.1          |\n| Taxes paid                                           | -44.3 | -4.5  | n/c            |\n| Change in net working capital1                       | 70.4  | 1.6   | n/c            |\n| Cash flow from operations                            | 107.7 | 70.2  | -53.4          |\n| Payments for land                                    | 10.4  | 117.0 | -91.1          |\n| Cash flow from operations<br>without new investments | 118.1 | 187.2 | -36.9          |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Net working capital is made up of inventories, contract assets and trade receivables, other receivables less contract liabilities and trade payables and other liabilities.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation of non-current assets of €5.0 million (previous year: €4.8 million), expenses from deferred tax of €5.9 million (previous year: € 2.2 million), the results from the revaluation of investments valued at equity by €8.1 million (previous year: €3.9 million), expenses for interest of €27.1 million (previous year: (€19.1 million), the decrease in provisions by €6.0 million (previous year: decrease by €4.6 million), one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories in the amount of €17.7 million (previous year: €0.0 million) as well as expenses for income taxes amounting to €20.0 million (previous year: €15.4 million) in the 2023 financial year did not affect cash.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to €11.5 million in the financial year (previous year: €9.4 million).

The combination of the high level of interest rates, the more restrictive procurement of real estate financing (compared to the period before 2022) and the loss of purchasing power resulting from the significant increase in consumer prices from 2021 to 2023 continue to unsettle private buyers and is reduce the number of potential buyers in the year under review.\n\nInstitutional investors also exhibited considerable purchasing restraint due to interest rates and the tougher macro environment.\n\nThe forecast published by the Management Board on 16 March 2023 for the volume of sales contracts in the 2023 financial year of more than €150 million was achieved with a sales volume of €211.4 million for 370 units and exceeded original expectations by 40%. This represents a decrease of around €81 million compared to the sales volume of €292.1 million (530 sales units) achieved in 2022. It should be noted that the direct and indirect economic effects of the war in Ukraine at the beginning of 2022 only had a significant effect on the sales agreements towards the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIn a long-term comparison, the sales speed of our unit sales projects for 2023 as a whole is below average. In the last quarter of the 2023 financial year, there was a moderate recovery. This is also due to the \"Urban.Isle Campus\" sub-projects in Hamburg that have been launched in sales and to a sub-project of the \"Neckar.Au-Viertel\" in Rottenburg. In addition, a large part of the sales success is reflected in projects tailored to investment sales. The shortfall in the fixed interest rate of 4% for ten and 15-year construction loans had the first positive effects on the number of sales contracts at the end of 2023. With a sales offering of 325 units in unit sales at the beginning of the year and an increase in supply of 419 units, 166 units with a revenue volume of €82.0 million were sold in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe majority of the sales volume in the reporting period was attributable to our institutional projects amounting to €129.4 million and 204 sales units. Adjusted for the sales volume resulting from supplementary items to purchase agreements concluded prior to the reporting period (around €50 million), the sales performance of institutional investors and in individual sales, however, is at a comparable level in the year under review.\n\nThe realised volume of sales contracts of around 78% as at 31 December 2023 was mainly focused on the most important metropolitan regions of Germany.

Given the current supply base, we are at a lower level than at the end of 2022 (325 units and €221 million).\n\nFor example, the Instone Group has driven product modification through higher sustainability classes, increased eligibility and smaller housing typologies to achieve broader performance and attract investment sales. As a result, four sub-projects with a total of 419 sales units were launched on the market in the year under review and led to an increase in the sales offer of the individual sales objects. As of 31 December 2023, 333 of the new units that had been launched for sale were already under construction. Construction of the 86 others is planned to start in 2024.\n\n# ←\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\nThe sales made in the reporting period in the individual sales division led to a reduction in the sales offering. A total of 166 units were successfully sold in the 2023 financial year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Instone Group's project portfolio comprised 45 projects with a current expected volume of sales contracts of €6,972.0 million. It was therefore down on 31 December 2022 (€7,668.8 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group continued to pursue the strategic approach of extremely selective investment activity, which was deliberately chosen in 2022. For example, no new investment approvals were granted in the reporting period and therefore no new property purchase agreements were concluded. We also expect attractive acquisition opportunities for projects of competitors with weaker financial resources in the changed interest rate and financing environment. The exploitation of these opportunities is expected to lead to significant investment activity on our part in the near to medium-term.\n\nThe main factors in the portfolio decline are the completions (€-493 million) and the portfolio's revenue reductions (€-204 million).\n\nFor example, a total of six projects were completed in the reporting period and taken out of the project portfolio review with the successful handover of all sub-projects (see the section \"Adjusted sales revenues[\" page 151\\).](#page-150-0)\n\nIn terms of revenue changes, the removal of the \"Am Sonnenberg, Wiesbaden\" project due to the change in the continuation of the project in the at-equity company as of the second quarter of 2023 played a significant role in the reduction. Further revenue reductions in various projects were mainly offset by revenue increases in other projects within the scope of further planning specification and changes in the sales concepts, as well as sales price increases through supplementary items to the purchase contract.\n\nWe have already realised adjusted revenues of €2,022.5 million from the current project portfolio, of which €788.2 millionhas already been handed over.\n\nImage /page/147/Figure/16 description: This image shows the development of the project portfolio on December 31, 2023.

As of 31 December 2023, the Management Board expects construction prices to move sideways, due to the current high cost level and the decreasing dynamics in construction production. An additional positive effect results from the adjustment of one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories (see also Results of operations, net assets and financial position chapter, Project costs section). This is reflected in the project valuations at the end of 2023 and leads to an improvement in the forecast gross project profit margin on the project portfolio to around 24.6%, without taking into account the \"Westville\" project in Frankfurt am Main.1\n\nImage /page/148/Figure/17 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"Project portfolio by region\".

The pie chart is divided into four categories: \"Pre-sale\" (56.3), \"Under construction\" (42.0), \"Sold\" (38.6), \"Unsold\" (5.1), and \"Pre-construction\" (1.8). The total value of the project portfolio is €7.0 billion.\n\n**FIGURE 020**\n\n<sup>2</sup> 0.7% of the project portfolio has already been transferred. These projects are included in \"pre-construction\".\n\n<sup>3</sup> 8.0% of the project portfolio are in the status of land acquisition. These projects are included in \"pre-sale\".\n\nGiven our project portfolio's continued growth in recent years, the conscious decision to take a selective approach to starting sales in the current macroeconomic environment and the on-going completion of sold projects, most of our current projects are in the \"pre-sale\" development stage.\n\nThe total revenue volume of the completed and handed over projects for the 2023 financial year amounts to €493 million. This is offset by an expected total revenue volume of €201 million from the sub-projects which construction began on in 2023. Since the total portfolio value decreased during the course of the 2023 financial year, all of the categories listed in figure 020 are at a comparable, relative level to the previous year (31 December 2022: 41.3% \"under construction\", 2.2% in \"pre-construction\" and 56.4% in \"pre-sale\").\n\nIn addition, the preceding diagram shows that, as at 31 December 2023 we had already sold approximately 39% of the anticipated overall revenue volume of the project portfolio. In terms of the anticipated revenue volume from \"under construction\" and \"pre-construction\" projects, approximately 88% of projects had been sold as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition to the 45 projects, the Instone Group's project portfolio will be supplemented by four further projects that will be realised in joint ventures. Overall, a total volume of sales of around €1.3 billion (Instone Group share approx. €630 million) and the development of approximately 2,100 residential units was expected for these projects consolidated using the equity method.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**Adjusted revenue**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n **[Economic report](#page-128-0)**\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nDespite the persistently difficult macroeconomic conditions, adjusted sales at €616.0 million were achieved in the 2023 financial year at the previous year's level (previous year's figure: €621.0 million).

In the 2023 financial year, other operating expenses mainly included expenses for organisational consulting and services amounting to €-5.5 million (previous year: €-6.9 million), other taxes expenses of €-1.7 million (previous year: €-1.3 million), expenses in connection with severance payments in the amount of €-1.4 million (previous year: €-0.2 million), expenses for IT services in the amount of €-1.2 million (previous year:€-0.3 million) and expenses for insurance premiums of €-0.8 million (previous year: €-1.0 million).\n\nThe changes in the financial result to €56.6 million (previous year: €63,7 million) were essentially made up as follows:\n\n- → Income from profit and loss transfer agreements amounted to €51.6 million (previous year: €71.1 million). The significant decline is due, on the one hand, to the lower margins compared to the previous year for the residential development projects handed over to customers after completion and, on the other hand, to one-off expenses recorded for the first time in the year under review relating to the valuation of inventories in the amount of €17.7 million (previous year: €0.0 million) owned by Instone Real Estate Development GmbH.\n- → Income from loans amounted to €15.3 million (previous year: €9.2 million).\n- → Income from interest on investments amounted to €4.5 million (previous year: €0.3 million)\n- → Expenses from the acceptance of losses amounted to €-3.1 million (previous year: €-5.8 million).\n- → Interest and similar expenses were at a similar level to the previous year at €-12.0 million (previous year: €-11.0 million).\n\nTaxes on income and earnings amounted to €-17.7 million (previous year: €-16.9 million).\n\nIn the period under review, there was a total net profit of €22.8 million (previous year: €34.3 million).

On the assets side, this is mainly due to the reduction of loans to and receivables from affiliated companies and, on the liabilities side, mainly result from the reduction in liabilities to affiliated companies.\n\nNon-current assets mainly included the investment book values of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, Essen amounting to €222.1 million (previous year: €181.8 million). The increase compared to the previous year is mainly due to the lateral merger of Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH, Leipzig with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, Essen.\n\nLoans, receivables, other assets and deferred income amounting to €210.9 million (previous year: €307.0 million) include loans to affiliated companies amounting to €119.4 million (previous year: €200.4million) and ongoing receivables from affiliated companies based on profit and loss transfer agreements.

This requirement results from the exemption from property transfer tax expenses in connection with the acquisition of the Company, for which a corresponding provision exists.\n\nAs of the reporting date, temporary valuation differences between the commercial balance sheet and the tax balance sheet resulted in deferred tax assets in the amount of €5.6 million (previous year: €4.8 million).\n\nThe equity ratio on the balance sheet date was 69.7% (previous year: 62.1%).\n\nProvisions fell to €14.6 million in the financial year (previous year: €31.6 million) and relate in particular to personnel provisions for pensions and for bonus commitments to the Company's employees and employees of group companies as well as tax provisions. The sharp decline mainly relates to tax provisions and results from the advance payments made in the year under review with a declining tax base.\n\nThe liabilities essentially consist of loan liabilities to credit institutions and other lenders amounting to €177.6 million (previous year: €180.9 million) and those to affiliated companies in the amount of €1.5 million (previous year: €58.2 million). The loans from banks, other lenders and affiliated companies result, in particular, from the strategic alignment of financial management, with which corporate financing is taken up by the highest group company and free liquidity is bundled in the highest group company. They are then used within the group companies. The significant decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies is the result of the sideways merger of Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and the associated offsetting of receivables and liabilities.\n\n#### **Financial position**\n\nAs an objective of appropriate financial management, the Instone Group, through Instone Real Estate Group SE, provides sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the operational and strategic financial needs of the Group companies at all times in the management's view. As a listed company, Instone Real Estate Group SE considers the interests of shareholders and banks in its financial management. Instone Real Estate Group SE ensures an adequate ratio between equity and debt financing in the interests of these stakeholders at its discretion.\n\n### **Staff**\n\nAt the end of the year, around 97 members of staff were employed at Instone Real Estate Group SE (previous year: 104 employees)[. GRI 2-7](#page-286-0)\n\n### **Outlook**\n\nDue to its position as a strategic holding company, the company does not have its own operative business. Sales arise almost exclusively from the administrative services provided to group companies and the remuneration agreed for this purpose. At the same time, the Company accepts expenses for the salaries of employees of administrative central departments, the salaries of the Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, as well as for interest expenses for corporate financing, including guarantee commissions. The sum of these expenses exceeds the recoverable sales revenue.\n\nCompared to the previous year's outlook, earnings after tax fell by €11.4 million to €22.8 million, contrary to expectations. This is mainly due to the lower income from profit and loss transfer agreements compared to expectations. In particular for the subsidiary Instone Real Estate Development GmbH, one-off expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories had a significant impact on the annual profit for the year in the reporting year.\n\nThe Company receives significant income from existing profit and loss transfer agreements with subsidiaries, in particular with Instone Real Estate Development GmbH Due to the expected business development of this subsidiary , a significant increase in income from profit and loss transfers compared to the previous year is expected for the 2024 financial year. Because of the overall effects described, we expect earnings after tax for the 2024 financial year to be well above the previous year's figure.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-155-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and opportunities report**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Risk and opportunities report**\n\nThe risk management of the Instone Group is geared towards securing the successful, continued development and profitability of the Group in the long-term.\n\n#### **Risk management system** [TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\nAt the Instone Group, the risk management system is understood to mean the entirety of all organisational regulations and measures intended to identify business risks at an early stage and to counteract them with appropriate measures in good time. This is intended to secure the defined business goals and future success of the Instone Group. Unrecognised and therefore uncontrolled and unmanaged risks represent a high risk potential for the Instone Group. Systematic risk management reduces the risk potential and ensures the continuation of the Company, the preservation of jobs and the successful further development of the Instone Group.\n\nKey elements of the risk management system include the use of risk management software, quarterly risk identification measures, closely monitored, database-assisted project controlling, periodic reviews, internal approval processes for any far-reaching decisions, the ICS and the foureyes principle. The powers for individual decision-making levels are clearly regulated in the internal guidelines. The risk management process does not encompass a separate opportunities management function. The Instone Group assesses identified opportunities with regard to their impact on the planned results within the framework of existing planning and controlling processes.\n\nWe are continuously working to optimise the risk management system together with our independent partners. As a German stock corporation listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Instone Group is subject to the corresponding regulatory framework. As a result, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are also obliged to issue an annual declaration on the extent to which the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) have been observed. All applicable internal guidelines, rules of procedure and measures designed to ensure a Groupwide standardised and structured approach to risk management are reviewed internally on a regular basis and updated where applicable.  [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\nIn organisational terms, the Risk Management Department is part of the Controlling Department and reports directly to the Management Board, which bears overall responsibility for the risk management system. It makes decisions regarding the structural and procedural organisation of risk management and the provision of resources. The Board also adopts the documented risk management results and takes them into consideration in its management of the company. The Supervisory Board's audit committee monitors the findings of the risk management system. In the interest of key stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and investors, the Management Board pursues a conservative, safety-focused risk strategy, which also takes the sustainability of our activities into account.\n\nThe first and second levels of executives below the Management Board are called risk owners and in this role bear responsibility for identifying, evaluating, documenting, managing and communicating all material risks in their respective areas of responsibility. Every employee of the Instone Group is required to behave in a risk-aware manner, i.e. to be clear about the risk situation within their area of responsibility and to deal responsibly with identified risks.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nWithin the scope of the risk management process, the Risk Management Department coordinates the identification, evaluation, documentation and communication of risks. It consolidates the risk reports of the risk owners and prepares the report for the Management Board and Supervisory Board. This enables the Management Board to systematically identify and assess material risks within the Company or in the Company's environment in a timely manner and initiate appropriate countermeasures.\n\nIn our view, the risk management system of the Instone Group ensures the early identification, assessment, management and monitoring of all material risks. This also includes risks that exist beyond the financial risks processed in the Controlling Department, which can endanger not only the net assets and financial position of the Company, but also intangible assets such as the Company's reputation. Project risks are identified and evaluated in particular as part of the project controlling process. Project Controlling uses a central database-supported software programme, the data and reports of which are used for close coordination regarding the status of projects and potential risks – at both the project level and the company level. In this way, potential dangers that may affect the Company's value or performance are recognised at an early stage. Under this approach, environmental and company-specific early warning indicators are taken into account and the regional knowledge and perceptions of our nationwide employees are taken into consideration.\n\n#### Risk assessment\n\nBy means of a systematic process, the risk owners regularly identify, analyse and update all risks in their respective area of responsibility, with the support of risk assistants, if necessary, that arise by comparison with the applicable medium-term business plan. These are subdivided into the six risk categories \"general business risks\", \"compliance risks\", \"financial risks\", \"IT and communication risks\", \"project business risks\" and \"legal risks\" and their subcategories. The determined levels of loss and probabilities of occurrence are classified within specified ranges for each risk and documented in a Group-wide risk overview. EBT and liquidity are assessed to identify any plan variances over a three-year horizon.\n\nRisks are documented as gross risks and net risks, meaning that the probability of occurrence and damage impact are determined from two perspectives, both before (gross) and after (net) the effects of effective measures to be implemented. The goal is to control every risk with the help of measures. Countermeasures serve to avoid, reduce or transfer risks. However, risks must be accepted in some cases in which no countermeasures can be identified, for example, due to macroeconomic effects that cannot be influenced. Individual risks are assessed as severe if the corresponding net risks would have a serious impact and at least a medium probability of occurrence. Risks assessed as being severe are to be explicitly listed in the risk and opportunity report.\n\n| Probability of<br>occurrence | In %          | Extent of loss | EBT<br>In thousands<br>of euros | Liquidity<br>In thousands<br>of euros |\n|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Low                          | ≤ 10          | Low            | ≤ 4,000                         | ≤ 3,000                               |\n| Medium                       | > 10<br>≤ 25  | Moderate       | > 4,000<br>≤ 10,000             | > 3,000<br>≤ 9,000                    |\n| High                         | > 25<br>≤ 50  | Material       | > 10,000<br>≤ 20,000            | > 9,000<br>≤ 15,000                   |\n| Very high                    | > 50<br>≤ 100 | Severe         | > 20,000<br>≤ 40,000            | > 15,000<br>≤ 30,000                  |\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\nThis scheme creates an assessment matrix that categorises the individual risk notifications into a traffic light system (green, amber and red).\n\n#### **Risk assessment matrix**\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n### **Independent**\n\n**[auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Supervision of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is regularly updated and developed and particularly adapted to changes in the Company and/or the Instone Group. The Risk Management Policy describes the core elements of the risk management system and defines the responsibilities. This is amended continuously as necessary. Basic and coordinating activities related to the risk management system are carried out by the Controlling Department, communicated to the Risk Management Committee and if necessary approved by the Risk Management Committee and the Management Board of the Instone Group. This process includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- → Documentation and communication of rules for the risk management process at the Instone Group\n- → Definition, ongoing determination and review of the Company's riskbearing capacity\n- → Further development of existing risk management regulations\n- → Point of contact for all fundamental questions of risk management at the Instone Group\n\nImage /page/157/Figure/23 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix.

Extraordinary meetings are convened when needed.\n\n#### Reporting\n\nRisk management activities and results are documented in a quarterly risk report, which is made available to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board's audit committee is also informed about the risk situation four times a year. This reporting system ensures that both management and supervisory bodies are fully informed and that relevant operational early warning indicators are in place. In this way, undesirable developments can be detected in good time and countermeasures initiated at an early stage. If material risks occur suddenly, they are reported to the Management Board without delay.\n\n#### Internal Control System (ICS)\n\nThe ICS is closely linked to the risk management system and regulates the avoidance or limitation of risks with the aid of control measures. It is therefore aimed at safeguarding both the risks of financial/sustainability reporting and operational risks. The ICS is regularly adapted to the current risk situation of the Group. The accounting-related ICS ensures the accuracy and reliability of accounting and compliance with the legal requirements applicable to the Company. In addition, it ensures the effectiveness and profitability of the business activities. The focus is on the prevention and detection of asset misappropriation and the protection of the Company's assets. The ICS is the responsibility of the Management Board. The Management Board is responsible for set up, monitoring, effectiveness testing and development. The objective of the accountingrelated ICS within the meaning of the relevant regulations is to ensure the legal compliance and adequacy of financial reporting. For this purpose, the ICS is embedded in the Finance and Accounting Department. The finance and accounting department is responsible for guidelines for the adoption of accounting regulations and for the content and timing of the financial reporting process. From an organisational viewpoint, work on financial statements for all companies included in the consolidated financial statements is carried out by the parent company. All companies and branches included in the consolidated financial statements are located in an SAP environment. The entire Group is subject to uniform accounting/ valuation requirements, charts of accounts, account assignments, processes and process controls. The central control elements are the internal approval processes, the dual control principle and the required separation of functions. The Instone Group has an authorisation concept that is adapted to the job profiles of the respective employees.\n\n#### Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department prepares a risk-oriented audit schedule annually based on an analysis of all material business processes. After approval of the audit plan by the Management Board, the Internal Audit Department independently and autonomously audits compliance with the legal requirements and Group-wide guidelines for the control system. It assesses the functionality and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system and identifies possible optimisation potential for minimising risks in process execution and in the control environment. The individual audit reports are made available to the Management Board, the audited business units and the risk management system for the purpose of checking potential identified risks. This allows the Management Board to make timely adjustments to processes and to further develop the ICS that is already in place. The implementation of the measures specified in the audit reports is the subject of follow-up audits. The Management Board and the Audit Committee receive an annual report from the Internal Audit Department for informatio[n. GRI 205-1](#page-287-0)\n\n#### Risk-bearing capacity\n\nWithin the risk management system, ensuring the Company's risk-bearing capacity is a key objective at the Instone Group. The assessment of the overall operational risk by means of risk aggregation makes it possible to conclude whether a company's risk coverage potential is sufficient to cover all risks, also in the future. The risk-bearing capacity is determined by comparing the risk coverage potential with the respective overall risk exposures over the three-year planning horizon. It can therefore be interpreted as available EAT or liquidity cover funds after the consideration of the\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nidentified quantitative net risks. The risk-bearing capacity over time is considered cumulatively.\n\nThe overall risk exposure refers to the measure of risk that results from the aggregation of all quantitative net risks in the risk inventory according to their effects on EBT and liquidity. The overall EBT risk exposure is then converted to an overall EAT risk exposure.\n\nThe risk coverage potential is regularly determined by the Controlling Department and is incorporated into the risk-bearing capacity assessment logic. The basic scenario for the risk coverage potential is based on continued corporate planning, taking into account the existing projects of the project portfolio, while maintaining personnel and material cost planning. The risk coverage potential for comparing the overall risk exposure EAT is formed by IFRS equity or, in terms of liquidity, freely disposable cash and cash equivalents, including contractually guaranteed credit lines.\n\n#### **Current risk assessment**\n\nThe main risk categories and risk sub-categories at the Instone Group are described in the following condensed risk assessment. The description is based on the risk inventory as at 31 December 2023. The greatest risks in the risk sub-categories are explicitly mentioned in the descriptions. Risk sub-categories are divided into \"relevant\" and \"not relevant\". Risk sub-categories are assessed as relevant if they account for more than 5% of the overall risk situation assessed (total of expected values), if at least one risk is in the \"material\" or \"severe\" range or if the Instone Group Management Board makes a corresponding determination from its higher-level perspective.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, as in the previous year, the Instone Group identified the sales risk for all planned sales activities of the portfolio as a severe individual risk due to the macroeconomic effects described in the section \"General business risks\".\n\nAs in the previous year, a large part of the risk situation relevant to the Instone Group is derived from the market environment, which is characterised by high interest rates and decreased purchasing power. In addition, the Instone Group sees a tightening of lending standards by credit institutions, also influenced by raised regulatory requirements. As a result, in addition to the significant increase in debt financing costs, the Management Board is particularly also focusing even more on new\n\nfinancing and refinancing at the company and project level on the basis of risk management. Changes in the risk situation are continuously monitored, assessed and, if necessary, incorporated into the ongoing forecast.\n\nThe same risk sub-categories as in the 2022 Annual Report are assessed as relevant, as the risk situation has remained relatively constant compared to the previous year.\n\n#### General business risk[s TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\n#### **Global/national economy**\n\nThe Instone Group is dependent on the German residential real estate market, which is influenced by various macroeconomic and general factors, such as economic, demographic and political trends. The increasing geopolitical tensions in recent years have caused growing political and economic uncertainties throughout the world. Detrimental political and economic trends across the world and in Europe could have negative effects on the export-oriented German economy as a whole and may particularly lead to a higher unemployment rate, lower per capita purchasing power and rising economic uncertainty. Such factors may delay demand for residential property.\n\nThe surge in inflation since 2022 prompted an interest rate reversal on the part of both central banks and capital markets, leading to a rapid rise in interest rates. This led to an increase in financing costs, which has had a dampening effect on real estate demand. Institutional investors also exhibited considerable purchasing restraint due to changes in interest rates and the tougher macro environment. If central banks stick to a more restrictive monetary policy and keep key interest rates at the current levels, this could lead to persistently high financing costs, which could also continue to restrict demand for Instone Group's products. In addition, demographic and socio-economic trends in key markets for the Instone Group could have a considerable impact on residential property demand. Although the population in the most important population centres of Germany rose between 2008 and 2023 as a result of increasing urbanisation and a generally growing population in Germany, this trend could reverse or at least slow down. In 2023, growth was comparatively less strong than in the first two quarters of 2022, which were marked by large movements of Ukrainian refugees. Not taking immigration into account, a shrinking and ageing population is to be expected in Germany. Lower immigration rates could reduce demand, especially in the key markets of the Instone Group. At this point, however, it should be taken into\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n```\nOutlook\n```\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\naccount that adverse development for the Instone Group would only become noticeable after the housing shortage in Germany has been reduced (see the \"Economic framework\" section starting o[n page 129\\).](#page-128-0)\n\nHowever, the Instone Group has achieved broad regional diversification so that it can better respond to possible changes in the market. The Instone Group is represented in core cities and prosperous medium-sized of Germany, where it offers real estate in different price segments ranging from publicly subsidised housing to high-end housing. The project portfolio includes new construction projects as well as the renovation of listed buildings. Projects have been sub-divided into different building phases so that the Company can respond to differing market requirements in each phase. Also in sales, different customer groups such as owner-occupiers, investors and institutional investors are served. Despite this diversification and other measures, the impact of the remaining risk arising from the global and national economies is considered to be relevant.\n\n#### **Sector-specific regulatory risks**\n\nThe real estate industry is subject to a great many legal regulations and legally influenced operating conditions. Changes in these areas can necessitate adjustments and measures on the part of companies in the real estate sector, including the Instone Group. These may include, but are not limited to, legislative changes or adjustments to construction regulations such as the German Building Energy Regulation, as well as regulatory intervention in the real estate market in the form of rent controls on new builds or quotas on housing subsidies, for example, which are not currently covered by civil law. Risks are identified on a case-by-case basis as part of regular screening of changes to relevant legal framework conditions. In addition, changes to these legal framework conditions due to longer building permit processes, for example, can lead to delays in the implementation of real estate development projects.\n\nThe Instone Group is active in real estate interest groups such as the German Central Real Estate Committee (ZIA) in order to contribute its extensive experience accumulated from a wide variety of projects over many years. Furthermore, we examine possible regulatory developments when acquiring land and take them into consideration in drafting the contract or determining the purchase price.\n\nDue to the potential severe effects of regulatory risks and given that they cannot be ruled out due to the multi-year project periods, the Instone Group deems them to be relevant.\n\n#### **Market developments**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, approximately 88% of our portfolio (based on anticipated revenue volume after completion of development) was located in the most important population centres and metropolitan areas in Germany (Berlin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Cologne/Bonn, Leipzig, Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart) and approximately 12% in other prosperous medium-sized cities. The positive population and household trends and the continuing need for new housing are, in our view, favourable factors in the current real estate market. In recent years, increased demand for housing has been observed in major population centres and large cities. If growth in the population centres changes, that would pose a risk to the core markets of the Instone Group. The Instone Group is also looking into project opportunities outside the core cities to counteract such a development. With the subsidiary Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, which operates in the affordable housing segment, the target group that can be reached and the potential project locations in major population centres and beyond – especially in so-called B locations – will be significantly expanded. We monitor market developments and the situation of supply and demand very closely so we can react to any changes that may occur. The year 2023 was marked by falling sales prices and declining sales transactions across all residential property categories (new and existing construction of single, two and multi-family homes), particularly due to the fact that demand is not sufficiently supported by purchasing power and financing ability. The Instone Group currently expects the residential property market cycle to stabilise again in 2024 and continue to recover in the future. This expectation is supported by signs that interest rates are beginning to decline and the fact that the growing demand for housing, also due to the high rate of immigration, will come up against a relatively tight supply of housin[g. GRI 202](#page-286-0)\n\nAs the Instone Group is directly affected by changes in the market, the effects arising from market development risks are deemed to be relevant.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Staff**\n\nThe factors of globalisation and digitalisation have lasting effects on the labour market. Moreover, sustained inflation is shaping the labour market and is a particular challenge at the current time. To counteract this, the parties to the collective agreement decided back in February 2023 to pay an inflation bonus split between 2023 and 2024. Furthermore, it is expected that with the expiry of the currently valid collective bargaining agreement in March 2024, the issue of inflation compensation will be the focus of the negotiations. In addition to those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements who have taken inflation compensation into account under collective bargaining conditions, those not covered by such agreements and their salary structure are regularly reviewed by Instone.\n\nFurthermore, the shortage of skilled workers creates a dynamic in the market of job seekers that exposes a growing shortage of skilled workers. This is a strategic challenge because key positions can only be filled after a delay. There is a risk that knowledge transfer management cannot be optimally organised. In order to meet this challenge, the Instone Group has set itself the task of identifying key positions and pursuing active succession management. The Instone Group continually evaluates the age structure within the corporate group and analyses future search profiles. The aim is to devise countermeasures to avert a potential loss of know-how at an early stage.\n\nIn addition to attracting new specialists and young talent, retaining employees is a key concern and a strategic challenge given the persistent shortage of skilled workers. In this context, the Instone Group is continually developing talent development programmes in order to develop the company's potential on an ongoing basis. A key approach is the internal mentoring programme to support young managers in their leadership roles at the Instone Group. Under this programme, the mentees are supported by experienced mentors in a programme lasting two years. In addition, the programme gives young managers the chance to expand their internal networks and broaden their experience by attending various keynote lectures. For the Instone Group, employees are the face of the Company and the link to our customers and business partners. By targeting qualified personnel, the Company can fill key positions with highly trained employees. These initiatives have a positive impact on the image of the Instone Group brand. They also help to retain sufficiently qualified personnel.\n\nDue to its streamlined business structure, the Instone Group cannot rule out vacancies in positions requiring highly specialised and individual expertise due to absences due to illness, termination or holidays. This may present a risk in certain situations.\n\nOverall, we consider the impact of personnel risks to be relevant despite the measures implemented.\n\n#### **Reputation**\n\nTo some extent, the Instone Group's business and growth strategy partly depends on preserving the integrity of the brand and reputation of the Instone Group as a reliable partner and quality supplier.\n\nThe Instone Group's reputation could be damaged by a number of factors and events which the Instone Group may not be able to influence at all or only to a small degree. These include unethical or illegal behaviour by employees or business associates, working conditions, incidents on construction sites, extensive or significant construction defects and associated claims for damages, an inability to provide the services requested by customers, negative reports in the (social) media, as well as threatened or actual litigation. In addition, the debates surrounding regulatory issues such as housing affordability and sustainability issues could adversely affect the reputation of the Instone Group.\n\nThe Instone Group may also encounter disagreements with local authorities and/or regulators in connection with its activities, resulting in administrative proceedings and unfavourable orders, directives or decrees that could lead to financial losses and delays in the completion of development projects.\n\nWith the involvement of external partners, the Instone Group has coordinated and developed a communication strategy and action plans to be implemented in response to different events. Reports in the (social) media are monitored continually in order to be able to quickly respond to any relevant reports. Incorrect or poor communication with the capital market (analysts and investors) would present the risk that the Instone Group could fail to meet the expectations of the capital market. This could lead to a lasting loss of reputation that could have an impact on the valuation of the Company.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n#### [Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Company's aim is to be informed at all times about the current business and market developments within the Group through regular coordination of the specialist departments. This information policy forms the basis for external communication. The Group maintains an ongoing dialogue with the capital market (investors and analysts).\n\nDespite the established risk communication, the Instone Group considers the impact of potential reputation damage to be relevant.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy** [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0) [TCFD risk management](#page-289-0)\n\nA detailed description of the Group's sustainability strategy and the resulting opportunities and risks can be found in the sustainability report starting o[n page 48.](#page-47-0) \n\nThe Instone Group is preparing to report in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), applying the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which will be mandatory for the Instone Group from financial year 2025 onwards. Since the 2022 reporting year, all major financial market participants have also been subject to a reporting obligation under the EU Taxonomy. The Instone Group is currently not required to report, but has been voluntarily reporting on its activities since the 2022 Annual Report. The ongoing and evolving legislative process is continuously monitored by the Instone Group.\n\nIn order to achieve the national climate targets in the long-term, new materials, new construction methods and new standards must be developed and implemented (target: climate-neutral 2045). Among other things, the focus is on reducing CO2 emissions and promoting the resourceconscious use of materials and using and recycling them in the context of the circular economy in the building sector. In reducing CO2 emissions, the Instone Group is also dependent on other industries such as the energy industry and their efforts to reduce emissions. The costs associated with a switch to recycled, reused and/or alternative natural building materials and materials for the Instone Group cannot yet be quantified. This is due in part to the volatility of prices for conventional, but also natural materials and building materials, but also in part to the fact that products made from recycled, reusable or natural materials are not always available on the market in sufficient quantities. The use of diverse and alternative building materials will lead to a broader supply in the future, which may have an impact on pricing.\n\nOther factors resulting from the derivation or implementation of climate targets, as well as the intensification of physical climate risks and preventive measures, may lead to higher project costs. Early consideration of physical climate risks in the planning process creates planning security and can increase the resilience of properties in the long-term.\n\nDifferent trends can be observed in the financial market. First, climate stress tests are being performed by investors and second, a change of investment behaviour can be observed, which supports climate-conscious decisions as long as they do not exceed a set cost framework. The Instone Group anticipates a steady increase in climate-conscious investment behaviour in the future. Failure to meet the emission reduction targets as a result of insufficient investments in climate protection or in sustainable product design can therefore result in a loss of revenue. The general market trend remains to be observed, but is generally positive for the Instone Group. For example, the company is building very low-CO2 and energy-efficient buildings that could potentially be priced higher than conventional buildings and therefore compensate for the additional costs of the sustainable transformation.\n\nThe risks of the sustainability strategy risk sub-category are considered relevant by the Instone Group.\n\n#### **Competition**\n\nThe German residential real estate market is highly competitive. This competition covers the entire value chain of the Instone Group's development activities. Competitors mainly consist of local real estate developers who have very good networking and specialist knowledge in these markets. Moreover, a few major competitors operate throughout Germany in the same regions and cities where the Instone Group is represented. In our view, the Instone Group is competing with these housing developers to acquire attractive development land, the availability of which is usually limited. Due to the changing market situation, however, competition for these properties eased in 2022 and 2023 due to the development of demand.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n#### [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nNevertheless, the Instone Group is one of the leading project developers with expertise in urban property development and complex building law. With its established branch structure focusing on core cities and prosperous medium-sized cities, the Instone Group has continued its strategy of intensive, regionally adapted market development. The Instone Group achieves excellent networking results in the markets thanks to its regional structure. This enables us to achieve our targeted acquisition volume and gives the Instone Group access to interesting projects.\n\nThis risk is deemed to be relevant despite the lessened competition pressure and successfully implemented strategy.\n\n#### Compliance and data protection\n\nThe real estate and construction sectors are subject to various laws and regulations, which relate to compliance with price-fixing and data protection law and paying the minimum wage in addition to measures to combat illegal work, bribery and corruption as well as anti-money laundering, among other things. As a listed company, the Instone Group is also subject to a number of capital market regulations, compliance with which is required by law. The Instone Group depends on the compliance of all employees with applicable laws and the compliance guidelines of the Instone Group. The internal Group-wide compliance guidelines and procedures for further expanding compliance are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are up-to-date and revised as necessary. All employees and business partners of the Instone Group are obliged to comply with the Code of Conduct for employees and contractors. To ensure this, every employee must complete mandatory training on compliance and data protection.\n\nWith the help of our compliance and risk management procedures and monitoring mechanisms, we seek to detect and prevent any violations of the law and unethical behaviour, including corruption and terrorist financing, investigate indications of suspicious activity, and immediately detect contraventions. In addition, we want to ensure that our internal guidelines are also observed by our employees.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram illustrating compliance responsibilities.

A digital whistle-blower system is available to employees and third parties such as customers and business partners so that they can report any wrongdoing anonymously.\n\nAt the Instone Group, the Compliance Department is organisationally part of the Corporate Legal Department of Instone Real Estate Group SE, whose head reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board also deals with compliance issues and reports to the Supervisory Board on this subject. The Instone Group has also set up a\n\nCompliance Committee, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of the Legal Department and the Heads of Taxation, Finance and Accounting Department, the Head of the Human Resources Department and the Head of Controlling & Risk Management. The Compliance Committee deals with compliance-related topics, including the continuous optimisation of the compliance management system, on a regular basis.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were no legal proceedings due to anticompetitive behaviour, price-fixing or monopoly practices. In addition, there was no evidence of any relevant compliance violations at the Instone Group in the past financial year that have been confirmed. Nevertheless, the Instone Group will carefully investigate and respond to suspected cases of compliance. The Instone Group is currently not aware of any cases of corruption and therefore no meaningful risks have arisen in this area.  [GRI 206, 206-1](#page-287-0)\n\nNew, extensive data protection rules must be observed by the Instone Group in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on 24 May 2016 and has been applicable since 25 May 2018. The potential sanctions for non-compliance are considerable. The Instone Group has appointed an external Data Protection Officer who is available to all employees as a contact person. The Instone Group provides annual training to its employees and provides them with information materials from external data protection officers. The IT landscape of the Instone Group is adapted to the current laws and regulations. The technical and organisational measures taken to protect data are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date and offer little scope for cyber attacks. A potential data breach or non-compliance with other data protection regulations can have significant consequences. [GRI 418, 418-1](#page-288-0)\n\nDespite the measures implemented, there is still a residual risk that violations of data protection regulations may occur. In the past financial year, there were a total of three known cases of personal data violations, but they posed no risk or only a minor risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.\n\nDespite the measures implemented, there remains a residual risk. We consider the effects of these risks arising from the areas of compliance and data protection to be relevant.\n\n#### Financial risks\n\n#### **Banking partners**\n\nDeposits with our bank partners outside of deposit protection can be subject to a total loss in extreme scenarios. Existing financing may not be continued. Both risks can cause a liquidity bottleneck for the Instone Group, so that new acquisitions cannot be made or liabilities cannot be serviced. Furthermore, interest rate increases may cause the previous financing\n\nconditions to deteriorate, so that existing variable financing becomes more expensive or new financing can only be concluded on worse conditions. To counteract this, interest rate developments are monitored continuously and all planning elements are adjusted accordingly on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Instone Group has a Financial Risk Policy that specifies the concept and structure of bank selection. Financial transactions may only be concluded with the prior approval of the Management Board and only with approved banking partners. In order to assess creditworthiness, the Instone Group follows the general market observations of the individual credit institutions and reviews potential default risks in given cases. To minimise the risk of default, investments are distributed among several banks. We consider the potential impact of the risk to be relevant.\n\n#### **Financing structure**\n\nIn principle, financial covenants are agreed in the corporate financing contracts. Failure to comply with the financial covenants may involve the risks of more stringent financing conditions and extraordinary terminations of financing. A termination of financing would trigger immediate repayment and, via a cross default, also the repayment of other corporate finance. In the event of terminations and the associated premature repayment of the financing, refinancing would only be possible under worse conditions. The covenant requirements are continuously monitored and forecast by the Instone Group. Prior to investment decisions, the impact of the respective investment on the existing financial covenants is checked. The Instone Group believes that there is comfortable leeway with respect to this covenant.\n\nDue to continuous monitoring, the probability of occurrence of the violation of a financial covenant is low. Based on corporate planning, there are also no indications that the financial covenants cannot be serviced in the future. Nevertheless, non-compliance with the financial covenants would have a severe impact on the Company so we consider this risk to be relevant.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Interest**\n\nThe vast majority of our project financing and parts of corporate financing are concluded on the basis of variable interest rates. The reference interest rate is based on the requirements of the European Central Bank. If the noticeable increase in interest rates since the beginning of 2022 continues or worsens, our externally financed projects would have to bear higher interest costs and interest payments than currently calculated. The findings from ongoing interest rate monitoring are reassessed monthly in the project calculations.\n\nFurther interest increases would also exceed the calculated estimates for the project portfolio share with planned property and/or structural financing and would lead to additional costs and margin burdens. After detailed analysis, interest rate hedging instruments have not been entered into to date.\n\nIn view of the current interest rate environment, the Instone Group considers the potential impact of further interest rate increases to be relevant.  [GRI 2-22](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nThe solvency of the Company is monitored on an ongoing basis by continuously updating the liquidity forecast. The liquidity forecast structures anticipated cash flows in monthly time windows according to their origin so that the level of risk and probability can be identified in a targeted way and quantified. The respective specialist departments provide planned figures for higher-level cash flows. The resilience and feasibility of investment projects or strategic management decisions can be analysed with the help of scenario analyses in the overall context of the company-wide liquidity forecast.\n\nThe Group must maintain a minimum level of liquidity to ensure stable liquidity. As far as economically reasonable, debt financing is generally concluded for projects.\n\nDue to the current lack of visibility into the recurring stabilisation of the demand situation, the sales speeds in the existing projects and the associated payment returns from the medium-term planning are mapped very conservatively. Unforeseen further delays in payment returns can have a negative impact on the Company's liquidity.\n\nSufficient cash and cash equivalents were available throughout the financial year. There are no discernible circumstances that indicate a liquidity shortage.\n\nDespite the implemented measures, the Instone Group considers the potential impact of liquidity risk to be relevant due to the tremendous effects.\n\n#### **Tax**\n\nThe expansion of the Real Estate Transfer Tax Act to include the notional element of the change of shareholders in corporations could also lead to real estate transfer tax in existing structures in the case of listed real estate companies.\n\nRegular tax audits may reveal tax risks that might reach a relevant level when they occur.\n\nThe current tax audit for the years 2014 to 2016 of the Instone Group is expected to end in the first quarter of 2024. Any findings that could arise from this are taken into account by suitable provisions. The ongoing tax audit of the Instone Group companies for the assessment periods 2017 to 2019 is expected to end in 2024. The basis for the conservative tax declaration is provided by accounting which uses the described ICS. The ICS aims to ensure the accuracy of the disclosures.\n\nThe possible effects from tax risks are considered to be relevant.  [GRI 207-1, 207-2](#page-287-0)\n\n#### Project business risks\n\nProject risks are recorded, evaluated and summarised in reports. Based on this information, meetings are held monthly in the project team and in forecast and result discussions with the Management Board. The risks associated with approved projects or upcoming acquisitions and their respective mitigations are discussed and determined during these meetings.\n\nThe various levels of management are granted clearly defined decisionmaking powers, including those relating to project management. For example, each new project (this also applies to the approval of the initiation of sales) is approved by the Management Board and, in the case of larger projects, also by the Supervisory Board. If projects run the risk of\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-167-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\ndeviating from key approved parameters, this must be explained and discussed with the Management Board within the scope of the monthly forecast and result meetings. In addition, in the decision-making process preceding the investment approval, the investment capacities of the coming years will be examined on the basis of the existing project portfolio and with the addition of the investment measure applied for. From the time of approval, each project must be fully taken into account in the ongoing planning process until it has been handed over in full or until the decision to dispose of it.\n\n#### **Business partner selection and contractor retention**\n\nThe Instone Group relies on the provision of construction and other services by external suppliers and contractors for the realisation of its development projects. Such outsourced services in particular include architectural and engineering services as well as all construction services. Although the nationwide increase in construction volume from previous years stagnated in the 2023 financial year, bottlenecks could also arise in the future on the supplier and execution side due to business closures and insolvency.\n\nIf the Instone Group is unable to find qualified and reliable contractors for its development projects, that could hamper its ability to complete projects on time within the stipulated limit and in the requisite quality.\n\nAs part of its corporate strategy, the Instone Group relies on its regional and partially cross-regional networks to engage qualified and reliable contractors, most of whom have long-standing relationships with the Instone Group, with a correspondingly long-term lead. In addition to maintaining a consistently high quality, these measures also serve to ensure the sustainable safeguarding of resources on the market. The Instone Group has also set out guidelines indicating the evidence to be provided by contractual partners in order to prove their qualifications and reliability.\n\nFurthermore, a lack of cost certainty in projects due to late subcontracting to subcontractors may lead to projects or individual sections of projects being implemented inefficiently. Cost increases due to short-term contracts and the resulting insufficient market penetration may have a negative impact on project results.\n\nThe implementation standards of our projects are subject to continuous development in order to adapt them to current state-of-the-art technology and the requirements of our customers. To ensure a high degree of cost certainty is achieved for the individual projects, the Project Service department, before sales release by the Management Board, carries out cost calculations for all projects on the basis of the individual costs of the partial services and can draw on the key cost figures and experience from the entire projects of the Instone Group. For the continuous verification of our cost approach, we regularly create post-calculations based on the actual costs incurred per project and transfer the knowledge gained from this to the ongoing calculation process.\n\nFurthermore, we also reduce cost risks by agreeing long-term partnerships with our contractors and by awarding contracts to contractors as early as possible for the most important contract work. Structural work, building envelope and technical building equipment. The Instone Group assesses the potential impact of the risks to be relevant and takes steps to protects itself against these risks in each individual case at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n#### **Approval process**\n\nDue to the possibility that the desired target building right with regard to an economically viable use cannot be achieved or can only be achieved with a considerable delay with the investment approval, there is a risk of selling a property without being built up. Furthermore, inadequate capacities of government agencies and changes in local government committee meetings could mean that processes such as obtaining planning rights and building permits may not be completed on time. This can lead to shifts in the sales and construction starts and, as a result, to subsequent realisation of earnings and return on payments for our projects.\n\nThe Instone Group relies on a strong regional network and expertise and maintains close contacts with the competent government agencies to reduce the risk of delayed project implementation due to delays in obtaining building rights. Any challenges during the procurement of construction rights are analysed in detail. Outstanding issues are clarified in dialogue with local authorities and community representatives. In the event of a high number of building applications, however, there may be delays in the process which could have a negative impact on the planned implementation schedule. In exceptional cases, the acquired land will need to be resold if construction rights are not granted. Due to the large project portfolio, such delays can often be addressed by re-prioritising the project implementation so that the impact is absorbed at Group level. The Instone Group considers the potential impact of this risk to be relevant.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Project implementation/construction**\n\nA number of risks can arise during project implementation, causing a delay to the start of construction or the late completion of the development project. Such delays can also lead to an increase in construction costs that the Instone Group may not be able to compensate for. As a result, under some circumstances the Instone Group may not be able to sell some or all its development properties on profitable terms. In order to avoid the risk of building cost increases, the Instone Group strives to agree fixed prices with all contractual partners for the duration of the respective project construction period. If this is not successful in individual cases, it is possible to coordinate sliding price clauses, which are agreed transparently on a sub-section basis based on construction cost indices according to Destatis. In addition, construction delays and any resulting delayed handovers can trigger contractually regulated rights of withdrawal and contractual penalties. In addition, this may also result in claims for damages on the part of the buyers and investors. In order to avoid such risks, possible project delays are subject to monthly monitoring with regard to their contractual provisions and the implementation of countermeasures.\n\nThe refurbishment of listed buildings involves special risks associated with the essence of the building. This could lead to risks in terms of costs and time delays. These specific cost and deadline risks are part of our project planning and costing. Our branch office in Leipzig, which has many years of experience in the renovation of listed buildings, can transfer the experience of already successfully developed projects to the new projects, thus reducing or eliminating unexpected risks.\n\nThe effects on raw materials markets, energy costs, production capacities, supply chains and price increases caused by the war in Ukraine in 2022 were less likely to affect costs and processes in 2023. All year round, material prices stagnated at a high level, and in a few sub-segments (for example wood, concrete steel) they showed a significant decline. The same was true for energy costs. Nevertheless, the price trend must still be regarded as volatile. Further geopolitical events and their consequences can again have a strong impact on prices. Supply chains have largely returned to normal, not least due to declining demand. From today's perspective, we expect stable material and sub-section prices on average in the coming years. Although there are also external market estimates of falling construction prices, it cannot be ruled out that the price trend will pick up again due to unforeseen events and that the economic viability of our projects will be adversely affected.\n\nThe continuing tense situation on the German construction and real estate market can also be seen in 2023 as the number of company insolvencies rises. In isolated cases, the potential insolvency of our contractors can lead to construction delays and additional costs. In addition, the development of construction companies is also restricted by the banks' cautious and cautious business activities. This makes it more difficult for companies to obtain new loans , for example to compensate for pre-financing costs for larger orders. This development will also influence the contractor portfolio of the Instone Group.\n\nIn order to be able to identify possible risks and effects at an early stage , internal purchasing risk management is structured in such a way that monitoring of the contractual partners must be actively initiated during the contract award phase by calling up a financial information. Each change in the respective company (e.g. in terms of financial position, legal form, change of management) is then re-evaluated and automatically reported to the requester via monitoring for one year. For verification purposes, in individual cases, a second information about another business service is also requested.\n\nDue to climate change, more and more weather events can occur, which restrict future construction activity to the extent that construction progress can slow down due to heavy rain, heat, cold or storms, for example. The Instone Group is protected by insurance against damage, but not against delays. Any events that involve delays in the construction process can lead to a later generation of revenue. In addition, delays due to late completion of construction work can lead to the elimination of already approved funding.\n\nThe Instone Group makes every effort to identify and evaluate all potential project risks at an early stage. The purpose of the regular meetings at project, branch and Group level is, among other things, to closely support the project and discuss potential risks at an early stage in order to consider the further course of action together. The Instone Group encourages communication between its employees to support knowledge transfer. This allows them to pass on specialist knowledge to each other. All projects are conservatively forecast in the Controlling System and brought up to date with the current state of knowledge.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the potential effects of these risks to be relevant.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Marketing/sales** [GRI 417, 417-2, 417-3](#page-288-0)\n\nBefore sales begin, it may be possible to apply market prices that can no longer be implemented at the time of the sale, so that the marketing and sales process of the Instone Group would be slower or more cost-intensive.\n\nIn our opinion, the purchase restraint described in the chapter \"Project business at a glance\" in the 2023 financial year will not resolve abruptly in 2024. In line with the current market situation, the company's forecast therefore continued to take account of the reduced speed of sales compared to the level prior to the crisis. There could also be further reductions, including a temporary stop to the sales process. It cannot be ruled out that the purchase prices will be significantly reduced compared to current price assumptions in order to improve sales performance.\n\nOur risk management ensures that the planned revenues and schedules for each project are analysed and scrutinised critically by the Management Board during the approval and sales release processes. We use our presale quota to test the project development concept and planned sales prices in terms of market acceptance. If the concept is not accepted or, for example, if sales expectations are not achievable, the project will be re-adjusted and rechecked. This is intended to identify and implement alternative sales channels and product modifications.\n\nAs in the previous year , the sales risk for all planned marketing activities of the portfolio represents a severe individual risk as of 31 December 2023, because it has a severe damage impact and a high probability of occurrence.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the potential effects of these risks to be relevant.\n\n#### IT and communication risks\n\nThe Instone Group relies on dependable, efficient IT systems for its operations and uses complex, customised IT systems to manage all phases of its development activities along the value chain. The Instone Group's IT systems may fail or be disrupted by events that are entirely or partially beyond the control of the Instone Group. The systems may be vulnerable to unauthorised access and data loss (inside or outside the Group), computer viruses, malware, cyber security attacks and the interception or misuse of information transmitted or received by the Instone Group.\n\nThe Instone Group has implemented extensive data security measures and is constantly working to keep pace with developments and meet the needs of the IT industry. To ensure this, the Instone Group relies on specialist service providers and renowned manufacturers. In addition, the legal requirements, for example, from the European General Data Protection Regulation, are taken into account when designing IT systems.\n\nThe server infrastructure of the Instone Group is fully implemented in the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform in the EU and is redundant due to the data storage in the Microsoft data centres in Amsterdam and Dublin. Continuously updated defence systems, client and identity management systems for all mobile devices, apps and user accounts, as well as a 24/7 Cloud Security Operation Centre of a commissioned specialist service provider protect the infrastructure against external cyber attacks. Multi-level data storage systems allow the complete recovery of all data. The measures taken ensure a minimum risk of failure and a high level of data security, in our opinion.\n\nThe Instone Group does not consider the possible effects of IT and communication risks to be relevant due to the IT concepts that it has implemented.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Legal risks\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n#### **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Liability and insurance**\n\nAs the warranty period extends over several years, the risk of warranty claims continues long after completion of the projects. This could lead to costs which were not factored in. The Instone Group, working together with its contractors, strives to hand over real estate of defect-free or nearly defect-free quality and therefore prevent any potential claims. The Instone Group is also entitled to assert the buyers' claims against the executing contractor.\n\nWhile the Instone Group is insured against fire, natural disasters, business interruption and third-party liability, the insurance contracts are subject to exclusions (such as terrorist attacks) and liability limitations for claims and insured events. The assessments of the insurance brokers commissioned by Instone Group to develop the insurance concept are based on qualified, industry-specific risk assessments. Exclusions and liability limitations have been individually defined with specific reference to the Instone Group products according to the probability of occurrence and possible effects.\n\nIn a specific, foreseeable individual case, the existing insurance concept can be subsequently expanded by individual contract adjustments or additional insurance policies, so that risks currently subject to exclusion or their effects could be covered.\n\nOn the basis of an extensively coordinated insurance package, we assume that we are adequately insured against the most common types of damage. We consider the potential effects of this risk to be relevant.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n- **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n- [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n- [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Report on opportunities**\n\nThe Instone Group defines its opportunities as a positive deviation from corporate planning, similar to risks. In addition to the risks mentioned, we believe that the current prevailing market conditions and forecasts for market development, based on the Group's valuation scheme, give rise to opportunities for the Instone Group, which will bring the current adverse market situation back to a higher price and margin level in the mediumterm to long-term. These include:\n\n- → Sustained high demand for housing and associated rent increases\n- → Rising population in conurbations\n- → Expansion of demand to the outskirts of the conurbations\n- → High willingness to invest in sustainable residential properties\n- → Socially and politically demanded sustainability in building efficiency\n- → Establishing efficiency-enhancing planning and construction processes for our nyoo product in the core business to create affordable and sustainable living space\n- → Attractiveness of residential developments through proximity to services, integrative concepts and social infrastructure\n- → Social and political pressure for the realisation of subsidised housing\n\nThe low leverage and high liquidity reserves of the Instone Group in conjunction with our nationwide presence and very good networking, our development competence with regard to urban districts with complex building regulations and our good reputation among municipal and institutional decision-makers provide the financial framework and the confidence to be able to use the opportunities arising from land acquisitions for the realisation of large-scale and complex projects in terms of volume to an even greater extent. From this position, the Instone Group also sees itself sufficiently prepared to take advantage of attractive purchasing opportunities from the current precarious environment of the real estate market.\n\nThe Instone Group is one of the largest German project developers in residential real estate and is represented nationwide in the most in demand conurbations in Germany. The majority of other German residential developers only have a local presence. They have very good networks in the market environment, but their potential project volume is generally smaller than the size of our projects.\n\nIn view of the properties it has already acquired and will still acquire, we see opportunities for the Instone Group to increase the commercial exploitation of properties in terms of gross floor area (GFA), site occupancy ratio (SOR) and floor area ratio (FAR), given the Group's many years of experience in this business.\n\nThe Instone Group pursues a value-oriented business model that is geared to growth, social and environmental sustainability and the interests of all relevant stakeholders. The objective is underpinned by a high degree of transparency, a comprehensive sustainability report that goes far beyond the legal requirements and the continued dialogue with all our stakeholders. This gives us further opportunities to be able to act successfully in line with our growth strategy.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n **Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)**\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Management Board's overall assessment of the risk and opportunities situation**\n\nAll things considered, the overall assessment of the risk situation for the Instone Group as at 31 December 2023 and the forecast for the current financial year continue to show a significantly adverse macroeconomic risk situation.\n\nOur forecast assessment is based on the assumption that we reached a bottom in terms of the price trend and number of transactions for residential real estate sales in the Federal Republic of Germany in 2023 and that we will see a modest recovery of the sales volume of our residential real estate products in calendar year 2024. Nevertheless, the risks are still high, especially in terms of sales speeds and sales prices, given that the timing of a trend reversal cannot be predicted exactly. The Management Board has adopted a series of measures to address this situation. Where possible, sales of the Instone Group products and construction starts will be carried out on a more detailed and sequential basis in order to minimise the risks of residual materials. The acquisition of properties will be much more selective. Liquidity and debt will continue to be the main focus of management decisions. The Management Board will continue to monitor developments closely and has prepared appropriate options for action in all relevant scenarios.\n\nOn the construction cost side, the Management Board that prices of materials and construction services will remain stable. It is currently not possible to conclusively assess the extent to which the declining demand for tradesman services would also lead to sustainable price advantages for the Instone Group.\n\nAny continued restraint in the case of new acquisitions will, according to current estimates, have a negative impact on the recovery of the growth momentum of the company in the medium-term.\n\nThe current financing environment has direct implications for the ability to finance individual existing projects as well as new acquisitions.\n\nProject-specific municipal decision-making processes, which are particularly related to the creation of planning and construction laws, remain risky and not always predictable in terms of time.\n\nFrom today's perspective, the Management Board of the Instone Group does not consider there to be any risks that the Company would be unable to adequately counteract or which could affect the results of operations, net assets and financial position in a way that could jeopardise the Group's continuation as a going concern.\n\nOverall, the macroeconomic risks and the associated risks of sales remain significantly increased. The Management Board has responded to these risks by implementing a series of measures aimed in particular at securing the company's balance sheet strength for all relevant scenarios and also enabling the company to benefit from the acquisition opportunities that can be expected in the medium-term.\n\nThe current risk situation was taken into consideration in the forecast.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-173-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n**Outlook**\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Outlook**\n\n#### **General economic and industry economic conditions**\n\nIn a crisis-ridden environment, the German economy as a whole is still in a weak phase. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, priceadjusted gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 0.3% in 2023. The restrictions on global trade caused by geopolitical tensions for the exportfocused German economy, the effects of the energy crisis and the rise in interest rates have been key factors in this. Higher energy costs and general inflationary trends put a heavy burden on manufacturing companies and consumers. The significantly higher interest rates resulting from the surge in inflation had a significant impact on the real estate and construction industry, which had previously benefited from very low interest rates.\n\nFor 2024 , the Deutsche Bundesbank anticipates a modest recovery of the German economy and moderate GDP growth of 0.4%. The Bundesbank expects that expanding international sales markets will have a positive impact on export demand and that falling inflation combined with significant wage increases should have positive effects on private consumer demand. The Bundesbank expects that German GDP growth will accelerate slightly to +1.2% in 2025. Due to the fall in inflation, the majority of economists also expect the ECB to take advantage of the leeway in terms of monetary policy and to initiate a rate reversal with several interest rate cuts.\n\nThe labour market remained robust despite the difficult economic environment. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, the average number of employed people in Germany rose further rise by an average of 333,000 people (+0.7%) despite the decline in economic output. According to the German Federal Employment Agency, the unemployment rate in Germany increased slightly year-on-year to 5.7% in December 2023 (previous year: 5.4%) year on year. This increase is\n\nlargely due to the forced migration of Ukrainians. The German Federal Employment Agency assumes that this effect accounts for 0.4 percentage points. The Bundesbank expects that this high level of employment can be maintained in 2024. However, due to the higher numbers of refugees, this can lead to an annual increase in registered unemployed.\n\nIn the past year, the market for residential real estate in Germany continued to be affected particularly by the sharp rise in interest rates. The increase in financing costs led to a slump in investment in residential real estate for both private and institutional buyers. At the same time, the structural supply-demand imbalance in the German market has been exacerbated by construction projects that have been postponed in part. While some 270,000 residential units were completed in Germany in 2023, the ifo Institute expects that only 225,000 residential units will be completed in 2024 and 175,000 residential units in 2025. Thus, the German federal government's target of 400,000 new residential units per year was again missed by a wide margin.\n\nPrices for newly built residential units in Germany in the top 7 cities fell moderately in 2023. According to data from the consulting and analysis company bulwiengesa, the average year-on-year price trend in the individual cities is around 4%.\n\nFor 2024, we expect prices for new construction properties to stabilise in Germany's most attractive metropolitan regions, as the still very tight supply in these regions will be accompanied by substantial and growing surplus demand. The high energy efficiency of new buildings is another factor stabilising the prices of our products. Unrenovated older buildings with a poor energy balance have lost value the fastest in the last two years.\n\nConstruction costs continued to rise in the past year, albeit with a marked decline in upwards momentum. Construction prices for newly built residential units have increased by +4.3% year-on-year in the time until November 2023. The Management Board of the Instone Group expects construction costs to be stable on average in 2024.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n**[Outlook](#page-173-0)**\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Outlook for the Instone Group**\n\nThe development of the macroeconomic and industry environment has a significant effect on the forecasts presented below. Another important prerequisite is the achievement of significant milestones in our projects. Other essential factors particularly include the creation of building rights and the granting of building permits, announced sales launches, meeting planned targets for the speed of sales, expected construction starts and the planned construction progress of projects.\n\nAny deviation from the management's assumptions regarding the development of the macroeconomic and industry environment, any changes in political factors or the risks and opportunities already described in the section \"Risk and opportunities report\" [page 156 o](#page-155-0)f this combined management report or any changes in project schedules may cause the actual business performance to differ from the forecasts, in the opinion of the Management.\n\nAs in the previous year, the negative effects of the significantly higher level of interest rates on demand were taken into account by the assumption of a lower speed of sales compared to the historical average. In an industry environment characterised by reduced forecasting certainty, we also assumed an even smaller number of transactions with institutional investors compared to the historical average.\n\nOn the basis of the assumptions made and taking the current uncertainties into account, we expect the sales volume to pick up significantly in 2024 compared to 2023, although we continue to expect that the volume of sales contracts will be lower than the historical average, at more than €300 million.\n\nWe are forecasting adjusted revenue of €500 million to €600 million for 2024, largely on the basis of already secured sales and expected new sales.\n\nFor the project mix that is relevant for revenue recognition, we expect a gross profit margin of around 22%.\n\nAdjusted consolidated earnings after tax are forecast to be in the range of €30 million to €40 million.\n\nAdjusted consolidated earnings after tax also form the basis for determining the profit distribution. The target figure for the expected payout ratio is 30% of adjusted consolidated earnings.\n\n| Forecast of key management performance indicators for 2024 in millions of euros | TABLE 045    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                 | 2024 outlook |\n| Revenue (adjusted)                                                              | 500-600      |\n| Gross profit margin (adjusted) as a %                                           | ~22%         |\n| Consolidated earnings after tax (adjusted)                                      | 30-40        |\n| Volume of sales contracts                                                       | >300         |\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-175-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**Other disclosures**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Other disclosures**\n\n### **Takeover law disclosures**\n\nThe legal acquisition disclosures are shown below in accordance with Sections 315a and 289a HGB:\n\n#### **1 Composition of the share capital**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the share capital (registered capital) of Instone Real Estate Group SE amounted to €46,988,336.00.

Furthermore, they may also be issued by companies dependent on the Company or majorityowned by the Company; in this case, the Management Board is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to assume the guarantee for the Bonds on behalf of the Company and to grant the holders of such Bonds option or conversion rights to shares in the Company and to make further declarations required for a successful issue and to take actions. Issues of bonds can be divided into sub-bonds with equal rights.\n\nThe Management Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights to bonds (i) in order to exclude fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio from shareholders' subscription rights to the bonds, (ii) in order to issue bonds against cash payment, provided that this is done at an issue price that is in line with the recognised issue price, however, this authorisation to exclude subscription rights only applies to the extent that the shares issued or to be issued to service the option or conversion rights or to fulfil the conversion obligation do not account for more than 10% of the registered capital. The registered capital figure on the effective date of this authorisation is decisive when calculating this limit. If the registered capital is lower at the time the authorisation pursuant to number (ii) is exercised, this lower figure shall be used. This amount shall include the pro rata amount of the registered capital, (x) which is attributable to shares that have been or will be issued during the term of this authorisation until its utilisation from authorised capital to the exclusion of the subscription right pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 of the AktG, (y) which is attributable to treasury shares in the Company that have been or will be sold on the basis of authorisations pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the AktG during the term of\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\n#### Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nthis authorisation until its utilisation to the exclusion of the subscription right of shareholders pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, and (z) which is attributable to shares that are or will be issued to service warrant or convertible bonds issued or to be issued during the term of this authorisation until its utilisation on the basis of another authorisation in similar application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG to the exclusion of the subscription right. Finally, the Management Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights to bonds (iii) to the extent necessary to grant subscription rights to the holders of bonds with warrants or convertible bonds (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority interest to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising their rights or fulfilling their obligations.\n\nBonds may only be issued with the exclusion of subscription rights if the total of the new shares to be issued on the basis of such bonds, together with new shares from authorised capital or treasury shares of the Company, which are issued or sold by the Company during the term of this authorisation until it is exercised by utilising another authorisation with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights, and, together with rights issued during the term of this authorisation until it is exercised by exercising another authorisation under exclusion of subscription rights and which enable or oblige the conversion into or subscription to shares of the Company, no more than 10% of the registered capital is arithmetically allotted. The basis for calculating the 10% limit of the registered capital is the registered capital figure at the time of effective date of this authorisation. If the registered capital figure is lower at the time the authorisation is exercised, this lower figure shall be used.\n\nIn the case of convertible bonds, the holders shall have the right to exchange their bonds for new shares in the Company in accordance with the specific conditions. The conversion ratio is calculated by dividing the nominal value of a bond by the fixed conversion price for a new share in the Company. The conversion ratio may also be calculated by dividing the issue amount of a bond below the nominal amount by the fixed conversion price for a new share in the Company. The conversion ratio can be rounded up or down to a whole number; in addition, an amount to be paid in cash can be set. Finally, it can be stipulated that fractions can be combined and/or compensated for in cash. The proportionate amount of the registered capital represented by the shares of the Company to be issued per bond may not exceed the nominal amount of the bond or an issue price of the bond that is lower than the nominal amount.\n\nThe conditions may provide for the right of the Company to pay the holders of the conversion right the equivalent value in cash instead of the shares in the Company in the event of conversion; the value in cash is to be calculated in accordance with the specific conditions and shall correspond to the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the share in the Company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Xetra (or a comparable successor system) during the last ten trading days before the conversion was declared. The conditions may also provide for the right of the Company to grant the holders of the conversion right treasury shares in the Company or new shares from an authorised capital in the event of conversion. The conditions may also provide for a conversion obligation at the end of the term or at another time.\n\nThe conditions may provide for the right of the Company to grant the creditors of the bonds, in whole or in part, new shares or treasury shares in the Company in lieu of the payment of a due amount of money. The shares are credited with a value which, in accordance with the specific conditions, is based on the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the shares in the Company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Xetra (or a comparable successor system) during the last ten exchange trading days before the sum is due.\n\nWhen issuing warrant bonds, one or more warrants shall be attached to each partial bond, entitling the holder to purchase shares in the Company in accordance with the conditions. The conditions may stipulate that those entitled to exercise the warrant bonds are either granted treasury shares in the Company or new shares from authorised capital. The proportional amount of the registered capital in the shares of the Company to be acquired per warrant bond may not exceed the exercise price of the warrant bond.\n\nThe option or conversion price for a share must be at least 80% of the arithmetic mean of the stock exchange prices of the Company's shares in the Xetra closing auction on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a comparable successor system), and indeed, (i) if the subscription right is excluded or subscription rights trading does not take place for another reason during the ten exchange trading days before the day that the resolution is passed by the Management Board on the issue of the bonds or otherwise, (ii) during the exchange trading days on which subscription rights to bonds are traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with the exception of the last two exchange trading days of the subscription right trading.\n\n←\n\n===\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe option and conversion price will then be reduced, without prejudice to Section 9 (1) AktG, on the basis of an antidilution clause in accordance with more detailed provisions of the terms and conditions by payment of a corresponding amount in cash when the conversion right is exercised or by reduction of the additional payment, if, during the option or conversion period, the Company increases the registered capital or issues further bonds or grants or guarantees option or conversion rights while granting subscription rights to its shareholders, and the holders of existing option or conversion rights are not granted subscription rights to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising their option or conversion rights.\n\nInstead of a payment in cash or a reduction of the additional payment, the exchange ratio may also be adjusted, as far as possible, by dividing by the reduced conversion price. The conditions may also provide for a valuepreserving adjustment of the option or conversion price even for other measures taken by the Company that may lead to a dilution of the value of the option or conversion rights, as well as in the event of a capital reduction, a stock split or a special dividend.\n\nSubject to compliance with the above provisions, the Management Board is authorised to determine the further details of the issue and terms of the Bonds and their conditions or to determine them in agreement with the corporate bodies of the Group Company issuing the Bonds, in particular the interest rate, issue price, term and denomination, subscription or exchange ratio, creation of a conversion obligation, determination of an additional cash payment, compensation for or combination of fractional amounts, cash payment instead of delivery of shares, option or conversion price and the option or conversion period.\n\nUntil now, the Management Board has not made use of its authorisation to issue warrants or convertible bonds.\n\n#### 7.4 Authorisation for the Company to acquire its own shares\n\nBy the resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 13 June 2019, the Management Board was authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to acquire treasury shares from the end of this Annual General Meeting until 12 June 2024 up to a total of 10% of the registered capital of €36,988,336 or the lower share capital figure at the time the authorisation is exercised, by being able to exercise the authorisation in full or in partial amounts, once or several times. However, the shares acquired on the basis of the authorisation, together with other shares in the Company that the Company has already acquired and still owns, may not\n\naccount for more than 10% of the existing registered capital at any time. The authorisation may also be exercised by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake or by third parties for the account of the Company or by its dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake. On the basis of the authorisation, the Company may also agree with one or more banks or other companies meeting the requirements of Section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG that they will deliver to the Company a predetermined number of shares or a predetermined euro equivalent of shares in the Company within a predefined period, whereby the price at which the Company acquires these shares must in each case show a discount to the arithmetic mean of the volume-weighted average prices of the Company's shares in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over a previously determined number of trading days. The banks or other companies meeting the requirements of Section 186 (5) sentence 1 AktG must undertake to purchase the shares to be delivered on the stock market at prices that are within the range that would apply if the shares were purchased directly on the stock exchange by the Company itself under this authorisation.\n\nThe purchase must be made via the stock market or by means of a public offer directed at all shareholders in the Company. If the purchase of the shares is made on the stock market, the purchase price (excluding incidental acquisition costs) must be no more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean value of the share prices (final auction prices of the Instone Real Estate Group SE shares in Xetra or a comparable successor system) on the stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main on the last three exchange trading days before the acquisition or the undertaking of an obligation to purchase. In the case of a purchase via a public offer, the Company may either publish a formal offer or publicly request the submission of offers for sale. The purchase price offered (excluding incidental acquisition costs) or the limit values of the purchase price range per share set by the Company (excluding incidental acquisition costs) must be no more than 10% above or below the arithmetic mean value of the share prices (final auction prices of the Instone Real Estate Group SE share in Xetra or a comparable successor system) on the stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main on the last three exchange trading days before the publication of the purchase offer or the invitation to tender. In the event of an amendment of an offer, the date of publication of the offer adjustment shall replace the date of publication of the purchase offer. If the Company publicly solicits the submission of offers to sell, the day of acceptance of the offers to sell shall take the place of the day of publication of the offer to buy or of the adjustment of the offer to buy.

The basis for calculating the 10% limit is the registered capital figure at the time of effective date of this authorisation. If the registered capital is lower at the time the authorisation is exercised in accordance with number (iii), this lower value shall be used. Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised to use the treasury shares acquired on the basis of this authorisation under the conditions described above, (iv)\n\nto fulfil obligations of the Company arising from conversion and option rights or conversion obligations from convertible bonds or bonds with warrants (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent or majority-owned companies of the Company, and (v) to grant subscription rights to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants (or combinations of these instruments) issued by the Company or by dependent or majority-owned companies of the Company to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercising the rights or obligations arising from the aforementioned instruments.\n\nThe authorisations pursuant to numbers (i) to (v) may also be exercised by dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake or by third parties for the account of the Company or its dependent companies or companies in which the Company holds a majority stake.\n\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, on 10 February 2022 the Management Board approved the acquisition of up to 2,349,416 shares (share buyback programme 2022/I) and on 25 October 2022 the acquisition of up to 1,349,417 shares (share buyback programme 2022/II), in other words up to 3,698,833 shares in total using the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 13 June 2019 for the acquisition of its own shares. As part of share buyback programme/I and share buyback programme/II, the Company bought back a total of 3,698,833 shares, of which it currently still holds 3,665,761 shares.\n\nThe Management Board has therefore fully exhausted the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting to acquire the Company's own shares passed on 13 June 2019.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **8 Key agreements reached by the Company in the event of a change of control following a takeover bid, and the consequent effects**\n\nIndividual contracts of corporate financing of the Company provide for a special termination right of the other party in the event of a change of control (partly defined as the acquisition of a majority interest by voting rights or equity interest, partly defined as holding more than 30% of the voting rights in the Company).

Under the employment contract of a Management Board member, the conclusion of a control and/or profit transfer agreement with the Company as obligated parties does not qualify as a significant adverse effect in the running of the business under certain conditions.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-181-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **Corporate governance statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n### **Corporate governance statement (unaudited)**\n\nIn this report, Instone Group provides information about the Company's corporate governance in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) on the principles of corporate governance and Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). In addition to the Declaration of Compliance with the GCGC, the corporate governance statement also contains information about corporate governance and the compliance management system, the composition and working methods of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as well as the Supervisory Board committee[s. GRI 2-14](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Implementation of the GCGC**\n\nCorporate governance involves the responsible management and control of companies, geared towards long-term value creation. The corporate governance and corporate culture of Instone Real Estate Group SE comply with the legal requirements and – with a few reasonable exceptions – the additional recommendations of the GCGC. The Management Board and Supervisory Board feel very committed to good corporate governance and all divisions are guided by this objective. The Company focusses on values such as competence, transparency and sustainability.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board have carefully considered the fulfilment of the GCGC requirements. In doing so, they have taken into account the GCGC in the version dated 28 April 2022 and, in accordance with Section 161 AktG submitted their joint regular Declaration of Compliance with the recommendations of the GCGC in December 2023 and commented on the few exceptions.\n\nThe statement and any further declarations of compliance since the IPO [are published on the Company's website in the](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5910/entsprechenserklaerung.html) ä Instone Group Declaration of Compliance.\n\n#### **Declaration of Compliance**\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE (the \"Company\") are required pursuant to Section 161 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) to issue an annual declaration of compliance stating that the recommendations of the \"Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code\" published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official Section of the Federal Gazette have been, and are being, complied with or which recommendations have not been, or are not being, complied with and why not. The Management Board and Supervisory board last issued a Declaration of Compliance in December 2021.\n\nThe Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board declare that for the period since the last Declaration of Compliance was submitted in December 2022, they have complied with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the version last published in the official part of the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022 and dated 28 April 2022 (\"2022 GCGC\") and will also do so in future:\n\n- 1. According to recommendation B.3, the first appointment of members of the Management Board is for a maximum of three years. During the declaration period, the Supervisory Board filled the position of CFO, which had become vacant following the departure of Dr Madjlessi, with David Dreyfus for a term of appointment of four years and three months. The Supervisory Board has therefore deviated from recommendation B.3 in the interest of the Company because David Dreyfus emerged from the structured recruiting process as the clear favourite and first choice of the Supervisory Board and one of the conditions by which he was recruited for this position was on the basis of the agreed term of his appointment. In addition, the agreed term of appointment reflects a reasonably long-term, sustainable appointment pursued by the Supervisory Board, which at the same time also prevents the existing Management Board mandates all expiring within a short period of time.\n- 2. In accordance with recommendation G.7 of the GCGC 2022, the Supervisory Board must define the performance criteria for all variable remuneration components for each member of the Management Board for the forthcoming financial year, which, in addition to operational targets, should primarily be based on strategic objectives. The corporate planning and the forecast, from which the relevant performance criteria for the Management Board are derived by the Supervisory Board, are adopted at the beginning of the financial year due to the higher level of planning accuracy. Based on this, the\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-182-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nSupervisory Board also defines the performance criteria for the variable remuneration components at the beginning of the relevant financial year. From the Supervisory Board's point of view, this is appropriate to harmonise the corporate planning adopted with the performance criteria for the Management Board. This recommendation will therefore not be followed in the future.\n\n3. Under recommendation G.10 sentence 2 of the GCGC, a member of the Management Board should not actually receive variable long-term remuneration amounts for four years. The remuneration system for the Management Board and the contracts of employment for the members of the Management Board, however, state that long-term variable performance-related remuneration should be paid at the end of a threeyear performance period. This is in line with the requirements under stock corporation law for long-term assessment bases for variable remuneration as well as the recommendations of various institutional advisers. In the view of the Supervisory Board, however, a longer delay in the payment of the variable long-term remuneration has no added value for the incentive of the Management Board compared to the existing contractual provisions. This recommendation will therefore not be followed in the future.\n\nEssen, December 2023\n\nThe Management Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\n**Corporate governance practices**\n\nThe management of Instone Real Estate Group SE is largely determined by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and is also focussed on the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Management Board has laid set fundamental values of lawful and ethical conduct in a Group-wide Code of Conduct, which is also available on our website at ä http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/ [English/5800/verhaltenskodex.html. This specifies existing duties and](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5800/verhaltenskodex.html )  responsibilities at the Instone Group and derives various codes of conduct on the basis of the law or existing official instructions. The Code of Conduct provides guidance and assistance to Instone Group employees in their dayto-day work while at the same time defining binding requirements for the actions of all employees. Instone Real Estate Group SE is expressly committed to the values reflected in the Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board has defined overarching principles for the thoughts and actions of the Instone Group, which can also be viewed on our website at ä [www.instone-group.de/en. T](http://www.instone-group.de/en)hese include, for example, the positioning of the Instone Group on topics such as social responsibility, the environment, economic growth, the sustainability of our projects and external communications, as well as the handling of stakeholder groups relevant to our company, including customers, employees, partners and contract partners.\n\n### **Working methods of the Management Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Instone Real Estate Group SE is a European listed company (SE) with headquarters in Essen, Germany, which in accordance with its articles of association, has a dual management system consisting of the Management Board and Supervisory Board. These work together closely and trustingly for the benefit of the Company. The Management Board manages the Company whereas the Supervisory Board provides advice and supervision.\n\nBoth the Management Board and the Supervisory Board each have their own Rules of Procedure which include detailed regulations about the respective activities of the Boards and the internal organisation, as well as for the collaboration between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board which go beyond the provisions of stock corporation law[.

The Management Board also discusses the status of the strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board at regular intervals. The Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Audit Committee regularly liaise with the Management Board between meetings and discuss questions of strategy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management, compliance, the internal control system and aspects of sustainability with the Management Board. The Chair of the Supervisory Board is informed by the Management Board without delay about important events which are of material importance for the assessing the financial position and performance as well as for managing the Company and its Group companies. The Chair of the Supervisory Board then informs the Supervisory Board and convenes an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting if necessary. In addition, the Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly and as required by law, by the Articles of Association and by the Management Board's Rules of Procedure, which contain comprehensive provisions for the reports and information to be submitte[d. GRI 2-30,](#page-286-0) [3](#page-287-0)\n\nThe Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board also stipulate that fundamentally significant measures and legal transactions must be subject to approval by the Supervisory Board. The relevant rules of procedure of the Management Board and Supervisory Board also contain provisions for the handling conflicts of interest within the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, which, in addition to an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay, provide for the approval of the Supervisory Board in the event of material conflicts of interest within the Management Board and, in the event of conflicts of interest identified on the Supervisory Board, prevent the member concerned participating and/or voting. In the event of material and not merely temporary conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board member concerned must resign from office. No conflicts of interest were identified on the Management Board and Supervisory Board during the year under review.\n\nTransactions between members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and related parties with the Company or its affiliates also require the approval of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The assumption of ancillary activities outside the Company by the members of the Management Board – in particular, supervisory board mandates and mandates on comparable supervisory bodies of commercial enterprises – requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA D&O group insurance policy has been concluded for the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.

GRI 2-9](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Distribution of duties and rules of procedure\n\nThe Management Board performs the management function as a collegial body. Irrespective of the overall responsibility for the management, the individual members of the Management Board are responsible for the departments assigned to them in accordance with the legislation, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, and are personally responsible in the context of Management Board resolutions. The Management Board has not formed any committees. The work of the Management Board, including the allocation of responsibilities, is governed by the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, which were adopted by the Supervisory Board and last amended on 26 April 2022.\n\nThe organisational chart defined for the Management Board is shown on the following page. The Management Board's rules of procedure also set out the cases which require a resolution by the entire Management Board. Management Board meetings are held fortnightly when possible, but at least once a month, in face-to-face or virtual form, chaired by the Chair of the Management Board. The Rules of Procedure for the Management Board also allow resolutions to be passed outside of meetings. Resolutions are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast unless the law provides otherwise.\n\n#### Reservations of consent and rules of information\n\nIn addition to certain approval reservations contained in the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board has set out certain other transactions and measures of fundamental importance in the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board which require its prior approval. These include, for example, the adoption of the annual planning, larger land acquisitions and the conclusion and amendment of certain financing agreements, as well as the implementation of certain corporate law measures. Transactions between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and members of the Management Board or related parties also require the approval of the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and must comply with the usual market conditions.\n\nThe Management Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly and comprehensively as well as promptly, and when appropriate, and in accordance with the legislation, the Articles of Association and the principles of information defined in the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board, in particular with regard to strategy and the course of business, as well as its prospective development and on fundamental matters relating to the Company, including on its assets, finance and earnings situation, the risk situation, risk management and risk controlling, compliance as well as ongoing projects and the Company's finance situation.

It works closely with the Management Board for the benefit of the Company and is involved in all decisions of fundamental importance.\n\nIts rights and duties are determined by the statutory provisions, the Articles of Association, the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board of 14 October 2021 and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board. It appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, represents the Company when dealing with them and, together with the Management Board, ensures long-term succession planning.\n\nThe work of the Supervisory Board takes place both in plenary sessions and in committees. The work of the committees aims to further increase the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work. The committee chairs regularly report to the Supervisory Board on the work of their respective committees. According to the articles of association, the Supervisory Board must hold at least two meetings in six calendar months. In addition, it must hold meetings as often as and when the interests of the Company so require. The number and material content of the meetings and resolutions passed in writing by the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year are explained in more detail in the Supervisory Board's report from [page 24 on](#page-23-0)wards.\n\n#### Evaluation of committee work and advanced training of the members of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the efficiency of its activities at regular intervals, most recently in the 2023 financial year that has just ended, and subjected its committee work to a critical evaluation and assessment in a structured review process.\n\nThe Company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training and continual professional development.\n\n#### Skills profile and qualification\n\nThe Company has complied with the requirements of the composition of the Supervisory Board under corporate law and the individual recommendations in section C.1 of the GCGC relating to the determination of specific objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board under certain criteria, the consideration of these objectives in the Supervisory Board's proposals and the publication of these objectives and their implementation status in the corporate governance statement.\n\nTo this end, the Supervisory Board has adopted objectives for its composition, a skills profile and a diversity concept to ensure that the Supervisory Board provides qualified control and advice to the Management Board. It most recently reviewed this in December 2022 and, as part of this, expanded it to include \"sustainability\". The members of the Supervisory Board must have the following overall knowledge, skills and professional experience required for the proper performance of the duties of a Supervisory Board in a capital market-based real estate company:\n\n- → Experience in managing or supervising medium-sized or large companies or complex organisations\n- → Members as a whole must be familiar with the real estate sector and the project development industry\n- → In-depth knowledge about finance, accounting treatments, accounting, law and compliance in the General Committee as a whole\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- → At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have accounting expertise and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have auditing expertise (Section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)), whereby accounting and auditing also includes sustainability reporting\n- → Experience with capital market instruments and bank financing\n- → Expertise on sustainability issues in the real estate sector and the project development business which are important for the company\n\n| Foundations of the Group                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Sustainability report<br>Economic report |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Risk and<br>opportunities report         |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Outlook                                  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ► Other disclosures                      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ► Corporate governance<br>statement      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Consolidated financial<br>statements     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Independent<br>auditor's report          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Remuneration report                      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Other information                        |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                                          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Skills matrix for the Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE FIGURE 024**\n\nincluding sustainability reports and auditing of sustainability papers\n\n- Expertise\n- Special knowledge\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n**[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board should also have an appropriate number of independent members.\n\nThe status of the implementation of the skills profile is also shown for the individual members of the Supervisory Board in the above skills matrix and updated as appropriat[e.

The members of the Supervisory Board should also have sufficient time to carry out their mandate. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, this is the case for all members.\n\nOnly persons who have not yet reached the age of 70 at the time of appointment are to be proposed for election as a member of the Company's Supervisory Board. The standard limit for the period of membership of the Supervisory Board is twelve years. These requirements were also met; as of 31 December 2023, no member of the Supervisory Board had reached the age of 70 or exceeded the regulatory limit for membership of the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board had at its disposal three committees: the Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Further committees can be formed as required. The tasks and responsibilities and the personnel composition of the committees are set out below:\n\n#### Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible, in particular, for monitoring the accounting process, effectiveness of the internal control system and internal auditing system, the audit, in particular, the independence of the auditor, additional services provided by the auditor, the appointment of the auditor, granting the audit assignment to the auditor, the determination of audit priorities, the fee agreement, the assessment of the quality of the annual audit as well as compliance.\n\nThe audit committee prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board relating to the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. It is primarily responsible for the preliminary examination of the documents relating to the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, as well as the preparation of the statement or its approval and the profit appropriation proposal of the Management Board. Furthermore, the Audit Committee prepares the agreements with the auditor (in particular the appointment of the auditor), the determination of audit priorities and the fee agreement, as well as the engagement of the auditor by the Annual General Meeting. This also includes auditing the necessary independence, whereby the Audit Committee takes appropriate measures to ascertain and monitor the independence of the auditor. Instead of the Supervisory Board full meeting, the Audit Committee decides on agreements with the auditor (particularly issuing the audit mandate, determining the main audit areas and the fee agreement).

Diversity is therefore an important element for Instone Real Estate Group SE for sustainable corporate success.\n\nGiven this, the Supervisory Board determined in 2018 and confirmed once again in the 2020 financial year that attention will continue to be paid to diversity with regard to the composition of the Management Board in the future. The Supervisory Board has also set a target for the proportion of women on the Management Board and a standard retirement age for Management Board members at the age of 65. In the interests of complementary cooperation within the Supervisory Board, the selection of candidates for the Supervisory Board should also be based on sufficient diversity with regard to different professional backgrounds, specialist knowledge and experience.\n\nAccording to the self-assessment of the Supervisory Board, the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board as at 31 December 2023 complies with the described diversity concepts. The members of the Management Board have a range of different professional qualifications and, among other things, many years of experience in international corporations, investment banks and consultancies. David Dreyfus, the successor to Dr Foruhar Madjlessi, another member with many years of international experience and specialist expertise in capital markets and corporate finance has been a member of the Management Board since 1 September 2023. Furthermore, none of the members of the Management Board has reached the age of 65. As at 31 December 2023, the Supervisory Board continues to have a diverse membership and the target figure increased by the Supervisory Board for the proportion of women raised by from 20% to at least one third of the members in December 2023 has been or will be met.\n\n#### **Target figures for the proportion of women**\n\nThe German Stock Corporation Act obliges Instone Real Estate Group SE to set targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, the Management Board and in the first two levels of management below the Management Board.\n\n#### Supervisory Board target\n\nIn December 2020, the Supervisory Board defined a target figure for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, which at the time was set at 20%. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board in the past financial year has been 20%, thus meeting the target, until the committee was expanded to include another person as from 3 July 2023.\n\nAs a result of the expansion of the Supervisory Board by another member, which was made in accordance with the Supervisory Board's election proposal, the proportion of female members – as intended by the Supervisory Board – now amounts to one third. Against this background, as announced, the Supervisory Board has also raised the target figure for female members of the Supervisory Board to at least one third and this target has already been met due to the appointment of Ms Georgi.\n\n#### Target size for the Management Board\n\nFor the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE, the target for the proportion of women set by the Supervisory Board is currently still 0%. This is not least due to the fact that the Supervisory Board, having taken into account the current circumstances, in other words in particular the current term of office of Kruno Crepulja and Andreas Gräf until the end of 2025 and the size of the Management Board, which only has three members, did not consider an early review and, if necessary, setting a higher quota, in other words before the end of the five-year period at the end of 2025 for a new review, to be expedient. Regardless of this, as far as filling the position of CFO, which became vacant in the last financial year, is concerned, the issue of diversity with regard to female candidates has also been taken into account in the requirements profile due to its importance, but ultimately it did not prove possible to fill the position with a female candidate. The Supervisory Board's actual composition has taken account of the overriding principle of filling a position primarily based on qualification and competence, irrespective of gender.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remains firmly convinced that diversity is a key component of a successful Management Board team. Therefore, within the scope of its personnel competence, the Supervisory Board ensures—most recently in the context of filling the position of CFO at the beginning of the last financial year—that diversity is taken into account in the composition of the Management Board. The Company has met the target during the period under review.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe target last confirmed in December 2020 for the Management Board is valid for five years until December 2025 according to the guidelines issued by the Supervisory Board The target for female members of the Supervisory Board increased in the past financial year to at least one third of the members and this will also apply for five years, in other words until December 2028. At the latest when these periods have elapsed, the Supervisory Board will review the targets again.\n\n#### Target for first level of management\n\nFor the proportion of women at the first level of management below the Management Board, which consists of the members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH and Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, the Management Board decided in December 2020 to raise the target figure to 25% (without taking into account double mandates), after the target was previously 0%. As of 31 December 2023, the proportion of women at the first level of management was 20%, which means that the target figure was not reached in the past financial year. Nevertheless, the Instone Group continues to attach great importance to achieving this target.\n\n#### Target for second level of management\n\nIn December 2020, the Management Board decided to set the target at 30% for the proportion of women at the second level of management below the Management Board, which consists of branch managers, commercial managers, division managers and department heads. The proportion of women at the second level of management remained unchanged at 28% as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: 28%), which means that the target has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the Instone Group is continuing to make progress in meeting this target.\n\nThe Management Board has set implementation deadlines of five years, ending in December 2025, for the achievement of the targets at the first and second management levels.\n\n#### Management development\n\nThe Management Board promotes the achievement of goals through longterm staff planning and development. This includes, for example, the targeted support of female employees through training and professional development courses as well as the working time models offered by the Instone Group to promote equal opportunities in order to increase the number of women in management positions. In line with the practice adopted since the IPO, the Management Board has also determined, in\n\naccordance with Section A.2 of the GCGC, that diversity should also be respected and promoted for management appointments within the Company. The Management Board believes that diversity includes, but is not limited to, age, gender, international background, education and professional experience. Notwithstanding, the appointment and promotion of senior management positions in the Company and the underlying selection decisions will continue to be substantially based on specific qualifications. The Management Board will therefore continue to select managers based on their professional ability and aptitude for the specific roles in this management role, regardless of their background, gender or other non-performance characteristics.\n\nIn addition, the Management Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on the appointment and succession planning at levels of management below the Management Board.\n\n#### Succession planning in the Management Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nTogether with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board ensures longterm succession planning for appointments to the Management Board. The long-term succession planning of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based on the corporate strategy, and takes into account the duration of the employment contracts of members of the Management Board and the standard age limit of 65 years laid down by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board has decided to negotiate an extension before the expiry of an employment contract, in principle together with the Management Board, and/or, if necessary, to initiate their succession by another suitable candidate. The Supervisory Board shall draft a job profile for vacant positions on the Management Board or for external candidates for positions to be filled, taking into account the diversity concept of the Company. In doing so, the Supervisory Board shall ensure that the knowledge, skills and experience of the candidates are in line with the requirements of the position to be filled and that they are balanced across the Management Board as a whole.\n\nSuccession planning in the Supervisory Board is the responsibility of the Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board, which identifies suitable candidates in the event of any existing or prospective vacancy on the Supervisory Board taking into account the competence and diversity profile of the Supervisory Board and recommends them to the Supervisory Board as an election proposal for the Annual General Meeting.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n- **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n- **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Compensation Systems and Remuneration Report**\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2023 financial year including the auditor's note under Section 162 AktG, the existing remuneration system under Section 87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG and the last remuneration resolution under Section 113 AktG for the members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are publicly accessible on the Instone Group website at ä [http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html.](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html)   [GRI 2-19, 2-20](#page-286-0)\n\n#### **Annual General Meeting and shareholders**\n\nThe shareholders of Instone Real Estate Group SE assert their rights at the Annual General Meeting and exercise their voting rights. Each share in the Company grants one vote.\n\nAs a rule, the Annual General Meeting takes place annually within the first six months of the financial year. The agenda for the Annual General Meeting and the reports and documents required for the Annual General Meeting are published on the Company's website at ä [Instone General Meeting.](http://ir.en.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/6000/annual-general-meeting.html)\n\nFundamental decisions are made at the Annual General Meeting. These include resolutions on the appropriation of any profits, the discharge of the Management Board and Supervisory Boards, the election of Supervisory Board members and the selection of the auditor, amendments to the Articles of Association as well as capital measures. The Annual General Meeting offers the Management Board and the Supervisory Board the opportunity to liaise directly with the shareholders and discuss the further development of the Company.\n\nInstone Real Estate Group SE provides its shareholders with a proxy who is bound to follow shareholders' instructions and who can also be contacted during the Annual General Meeting in order to allow shareholders to personally exercise their rights. The invitation to the Annual General Meeting explains how instructions can be issued prior to the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders also remain free to be represented at the Annual General Meeting by a proxy of their choice.\n\n#### **2023 Annual General Meeting**\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting of Instone Real Estate Group SE took place in Essen on 14 June 2023 and was held as a general meeting with the shareholders physically present.

Those present accounted for 90.3% of the registered share capital (90.42% of the registered capital taking postal votes into account). All agenda items were agreed with a large majority.\n\n#### **Compliance**\n\nCompliance is a significant part of successful and responsible corporate governance at the Instone Group.\n\nWe are committed to ethical principles and valid legal norms.

The Code of Conduct is applicable throughout the Group and was introduced in all affiliated companies where we have direct or indirect controlling influence. A controlling influence is normally assumed if there is a participation in more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\nWe also expect our partners, such as customers, suppliers and other contract partners, to comply with certain standards, particularly including compliance with legal requirements and regulations that we have set out in our Code of Conduct for contractual partners, available on our website at ä [https://instone.de/en/become-a-partner/.](https://instone.de/en/become-a-partner/)\n\nOur central compliance organisation sees itself as a key contributor to an integrity-led corporate governance and culture.

We have therefore implemented a compliance management system that identifies and reduces risks, and ensures compliance within the Instone Group. To achieve this, we make use of various internal company policies and processes, such as money laundering prevention and business partner compliance, capital market compliance and corruption prevention, as well as training and advising our employees. Other important pillars of our compliance management system are our whistleblower system and our Code of Conduct for our contract partners.\n\nOur Group Compliance Officer is responsible for the Group-wide drafting, development and implementation of the compliance management system and for conducting the training courses. The Compliance Officer is available to employees as contact persons for compliance issues. The effectiveness and appropriateness of the compliance system are reviewed at regular meetings of the compliance committee, and any follow-up needs are identified and carried out. Within the scope of the ongoing development of the compliance management system, and when dealing with legal issues, the Management Board and compliance officer at the Group level can be given legal advice if required.\n\nWe regularly conduct compliance and data protection training that provides our employees with information about laws and codes of conduct. Attendance at the training events is mandatory for all Instone Group and is reviewed and documented. In the year under review, the rate of successful completion of training sessions was over 99%. In the year under review, the topics related primarily to anti-corruption, data protection, data security and competition and cartel law. There is a compliance Section on the Instone Group Intranet site so that employees have direct, compact access to any material compliance information (including contact details for compliance, links and guidelines). Information on all current compliance topics is posted her[e. GRI 205-2,](#page-287-0) [410, 410-1](#page-288-0)\n\n#### Whistleblower system\n\nDespite having the best, wide-ranging prevention measures, illegal acts and breaches of duty may still occur. Employees, customers, contract partners and other third parties may report violations or suspected violations of laws and internal guidelines and regulations by email and via a digital whistleblower portal specially set up for this purpose, via which reports can be passed on anonymously to the Instone Group at the request of the whistleblower. Our employees can also contact their line managers and the Compliance Officer directly at any time with informatio[n. GRI 2-16](#page-286-0)\n\nWe check all reports and follow them up consistently. In doing so, we observe the following principles:\n\n- → The process is fair,\n- → Anonymity is protected,\n- → Investigations are confidential and\n- → Processes are efficient and protected.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there was no evidence of compliance breaches at the Instone Group that have proven to be accurate. Nevertheless, Instone Group will carefully investigate and respond to suspected cases of compliance breaches.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Money Laundering Prevention and Business Partner Compliance\n\n### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n- **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n- [Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n- [Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n- [Economic report](#page-128-0)\n- Risk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n- [Outlook](#page-173-0)\n- **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n- **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe careful selection of business partners, in particular to reduce corruption and fraud risks as well as to prevent money laundering is an essential component of compliance at the Instone Group. The Instone Group has therefore implemented special preventive measures, which are routinely or occasionally carried out in order to detect and counteract such suspicions, including:\n\n- → Due diligence of business partners for compliance risks,\n- → Due diligence around suspected money laundering,\n- → Checking of potential business partners against sanctions lists and\n- → Verification of bank details and payment transactions for contract partners.\n\nPrior to the conclusion of any contract (for example with contractors or buyers of our properties), a business partner audit (third party due diligence) must be carried out by the Instone Group on a regular basis. Employees of the Instone Group are obliged to first identify each potential business partner carefully. This is primarily due to those employees who conclude contracts with business partners, such as Purchasing and Project or Sales Management. If an increased compliance risk or money laundering risk is identified as part of this, the Compliance Officer must become involved.\n\nThe Instone Group and its employees also comply with the requirements of the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) in order to protect the company from damage (in particular with regard to reputation and standing). In the case of real estate transactions, the certifying notaries are also obliged to carry out an identity check and contribute to preventing money laundering as part of said real estate transactions. If a suspected money laundering risk is identified during the business partner check, the business partner is reviewed more closely. If the suspicion of a money laundering risk is confirmed, the Compliance Officer decides on the further course of action and making a report to the relevant state authorities.\n\nThe Instone Group complies with its legal obligations to check new customers, suppliers and service providers for their inclusion on sanctions lists. For example, existing customers and suppliers with whom a long-term relationship exists are regularly checked.\n\nTo prevent fraud, our employees are also obliged to check and release bank details, transfers and payments received by a company directive in compliance with the principle of dual control.\n\n#### Code of Conduct for contractual partners\n\nWe also demand compliance with our high standards from our business partners and suppliers. As mentioned above, in our Code of Conduct for contractual partners, they commit to refraining from any kind of corruption or acts that could be construed as such. We also expect and work to ensure that our business partners and suppliers respect these obligations, principles and values, and take all of the measures necessary to prevent and punish active and passive corruption.\n\n#### Capital Market Compliance\n\nAs a listed company and listed in the Prime Standard, the Instone Group is subject to a number of capital market regulations, which are based in particular on the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation), the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) and the Stock Exchange Ordinance for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The Instone Group encourages its board members and employees to comply with these obligations by establishing rules of conduct that relate in particular to the following obligations:\n\n- → Ban on insider trading and the illegal disclosure of inside information\n- → Obligation for ad hoc publication\n- → Ban on market manipulation\n- → Reporting of business transactions carried out by management staff on their own behalf\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n **Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n[Foundations of the Group](#page-35-0)\n\n[Sustainability report](#page-47-0)\n\n[Economic report](#page-128-0)\n\nRisk and [opportunities report](#page-155-0)\n\n[Outlook](#page-173-0)\n\n#### **[Other disclosures](#page-175-0)**\n\n **[Corporate governance](#page-181-0) statement**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe Instone Group has also set up an ad hoc committee to advise the Management Board on specific occasions and to recommend action for dealing with possible insider information. Employees are obliged to report possible insider information to the ad hoc committee without delay and, if they become aware of insider information, are added to insider lists in accordance with legal obligations. Trading in Instone Group shares with knowledge of inside information is banned. Employees are also urged not to conduct any direct or indirect business with Instone Group shares during socalled closed periods within 30 days prior to the publication of the halfyear or annual financial statements. They are notified of the start and end of these closed periods by a traffic light system on the Instone Group Intranet.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE as well as other personnel performing management tasks at Instone Real Estate Group SE, and persons closely related to them are required under Article 19(1) of the Market Abuse Regulation to report transactions in shares of Instone Real Estate Group SE or related financial instruments to the Company without delay and no later than three business days after the date of the transaction. The Company publishes the notifications pursuant to Article 19 (2) of the Market Abuse Regulation without delay and no later than three business days after the transaction.

financial statements**\n\n#### General information about the Company\n\nAs of 28 August 2018, Instone Real Estate Group SE (hereinafter referred to as the \"Company\") is domiciled in Essen, Germany, and its head office is located at Grugaplatz 2–4, 45131 Essen, Germany. It is the ultimate parent company of Instone Real Estate Group SE (hereinafter also referred to as \"Instone Group\"). The Company is registered under the record number HRB 32658 in the Commercial Register of the Local Court of Essen.\n\nThe Company holds interests in subsidiaries whose principal activities are the acquisition, development, construction, leasing, management and sale or other use of land and buildings, as well as holding interests in other companies active in the sector.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and the combined management report were approved by the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE on 8 March 2024.\n\n#### Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  [GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group as of 31 December 2023 were prepared on the reporting date on the basis of Section 315e(1) HGB in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the related Interpretations (IFRIC) of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as they apply in accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of international accounting standards in the European Union.\n\nVarious items of the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement are combined into one item for a better overview. These items are shown and explained separately in the Notes. The consolidated income statement is prepared according to the nature of expense method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros, which is the functional currency and the reporting currency of the Group. All amounts are expressed in thousands of euros (€ thousand) unless stated otherwise. Commercial rounding may lead to immaterial rounding differences in the totals.\n\nIn the course of reporting on our corporate responsibility activities, we are guided by recognised standards and reporting initiatives, including the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In order to clearly illustrate the contribution made by our products, services and activities to the respective sustainability goal and our value chain, we have marked the corresponding text passages with the respective GRI and TCFD symbol (illustrative exampl[e: GRI](#page-286-0), [TCFD](#page-289-0)). The references contain information that is not included in the notes, which is excluded from the content review by the auditor.\n\nThe subsidiary financial statements included were prepared on the reporting date of the financial statements of Instone Real Estate Group SE.\n\n#### Accounting standards to be applied for the first time in the current financial year [GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nIn recent years, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has made various changes to existing IFRS and published new IFRS as well as Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC). The aim is to clarify inconsistencies and formulations. The following standards that were to be applied from financial years beginning on or after 31 December 2023 had no impact on these consolidated financial statements, except for any additional disclosures in the Notes:\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Our company                                         | → IFRS 17       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| To our shareholders                                 | → Amendments t  |\n| Combined<br>management report                       | → Amendments t  |\n| ► Consolidated financial<br>statements              | → Annual Improv |\n| Consolidated income<br>statement                    |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of comprehensive income   |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of financial position     |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of cash flows             |                 |\n| Consolidated statement<br>of changes in equity      |                 |\n| ► Notes to the consolidated<br>financial statements | → Amendments t  |\n| Independent<br>auditor's report                     |                 |\n| Remuneration report                                 | → Amendments t  |\n| Other information                                   |                 |\n\n| → | Amendments to IAS 1                                                                   |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| → | Amendments to IAS 8                                                                   |\n| → | Amendments to IAS 12                                                                  |\n| → | Annual Improvements to IFRSs, 2018–2020 cycle                                         |\n|   | Accounting standards and interpretations already published<br>but not yet implemented |\n|   | In addition to the above-mentioned mandatory IFRSs, the IASB ha                       |\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned mandatory IFRSs, the IASB has published further amended IASs and IFRSs, but these only need to be applied at a later date. Several of these standards have already been transposed into EU law (\"endorsement\"). Voluntary early application of these standards is expressly permitted or recommended. The Instone Group does not make use of this option. These standards will be implemented in the consolidated financial statements of the time of mandatory adoption.\n\n### Already incorporated into EU law (first-time adoption date in\n\n- → Amendments to IFRS 16 (1 January 2024)\n- → Amendments to IAS 1 (1 January 2024)\n\n### Not yet incorporated into EU law (first-time adoption date in\n\n- → Amendments to IAS 7 (1 January 2024)\n- → Amendments to IAS 21 (1 January 2025)\n\nWith the exception of new or modified notes, the new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Scope of consolidatio[n GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nThe equity investments of Instone Real Estate Group SE include subsidiaries, joint ventures and financial interests.\n\nIn addition to Instone Real Estate Group SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Instone Group include all subsidiaries controlled by Instone Real Estate Group SE according to the acquisition method. A control relationship exists if the Instone Group as an investor has the continuing opportunity to determine the relevant activities of the subsidiary. Significant activities are activities that significantly affect returns. Furthermore, Instone Real Estate Group SE must have an interest in the form of fluctuating returns and be able to influence them with the options and rights available to the Company for its own benefit. As a rule, a controlling relationship exists if the majority of the voting rights are held directly or indirectly. In group companies, a controlling relationship can also arise through contractual agreements.\n\nShares in joint ventures and associated companies are recognised using the equity method. A joint venture is established if the Instone Group jointly conducts activities together with third parties on the basis of a contractual obligation. Decisions on relevant activities are taken unanimously between the partners. The partners have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. An associated company exists if the Instone Group can exert significant influence without being able to control that company.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, a total of 13 (previous year: 17) domestic and two (previous year: two) European foreign subsidiaries, in addition to Instone Real Estate Group SE, have been included and fully consolidated in the current consolidated financial statements. In the 2023 financial year, three companies were eliminated from the scope of consolidation due to mergers.\n\nDue to a loss of control, Projekt Am Sonnenberg Wiesbaden GmbH was deconsolidated in the reporting year. The shares of the joint venture are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The profit of €2,815 thousand resulting from the initial valuation of the atequity investment is recognised as other operating income. This deconsolidation has meant that a short-term loan receivable in the amount of €19,833 thousand is reported. At the same time, the accounting recognition of the project and the corresponding project financial liability is no longer required in the year under review due to the loss of control.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nOn 31 December 2023, ten joint ventures (previous year: eight) were valued using the equity method. In the previous year, an associated company was valued using the equity method. The measurement using the equity method was based on the latest available annual financial statements.\n\nIn total, six subsidiaries (previous year: six) had a low business volume or no business operation and were not consolidated on grounds of materiality. They are recognised at acquisition cost under other investments.\n\nDue to their overall minor importance, six companies (previous year: five) were not included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. These companies are of minor importance both individually and as a whole for the presentation of the results of operations, net assets and financial position of the Instone Group.\n\nA detailed overview of all shares directly or indirectly held by Instone Real Estate Group SE is provided in the list of shareholdings[. page](#page-252-0) 253 et seq..\n\n#### Business combination[s GRI 2-4](#page-286-0)\n\nBusiness combinations are recognised at acquisition cost as soon as control is transferred to the Instone Group.\n\nThe consideration paid for the acquisition is measured at fair value. The same applies to the acquired identifiable net assets and debts. The resulting goodwill is subjected to an impairment test annually. All profits from acquisitions at prices below the market value are posted directly to income. Transaction costs are recognised when they arise, except when issuing bonds or equity securities.\n\nThe consideration paid does not include the amounts required to settle past relationship receivables. These amounts are always recognised in the income statement. Contingent considerations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. If an obligation to make a contingent consideration that meets the requirements of the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity and it will not be revalued and recognised in equity. In other respects, a contingent consideration is valued at the fair value as of the respective reporting date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### Acquisition of non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured on the basis of their share, which at the time of acquisition is equal to the identifiable net assets of the acquirer. Changes in the Instone Group's investments in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.\n\n#### Principles of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared using standardised accounting principles. Intercompany balances, business transactions, income and expenses as well as profits and losses from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Deferred tax is deferred for temporary differences from consolidation measures. Consolidation adjustments are performed on impairment losses recorded for Group companies in their separate financial statements.\n\nThe same consolidation principles apply to shares in equity-accounted investees. These include the joint ventures of the Instone Group.\n\nThe financial statements of all equity-accounted affiliated companies are prepared in accordance with standardised Group accounting principles.\n\n#### Foreign currency translation\n\nAll fully consolidated companies and equity-accounted affiliated companies prepare their separate financial statements in accordance with standardised Group accounting principles.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n#### [Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Accounting principles\n\nAssets and liabilities are recognised according to the historical cost principle. This excludes derivative financial instruments, securities and shares in associates which are recognised at fair value.\n\n**Goodwill** from the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised at cost and is not subject to scheduled depreciation, but is instead subject to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 once a year and, in addition, a further test if there exist indicators that point to a potential impairment. The goodwill accounted for in the Bavaria North branch as a cashgenerating unit, is classified as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as it has neither a product life cycle nor is it subject to technical, technological or commercial wear or other restrictions.\n\nThe annual impairment test of goodwill is carried out at the Instone Group on 31 December of the financial year. As part of the impairment tests, the recoverable amount of a branch is compared with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of the individual value in use of the allocated project developments. This corresponds to the present value of future cash flows that are expected to be achieved from the group of cash-generating units. The value in use is calculated on the basis of a project valuation model (discounted cash flow method). The determination is based on project-based cash flow plans for the next four years, which are generally based on the project planning approved by the Management Board and valid at the time the impairment test is carried out for the development period. There was no assumption of cash flows beyond the planning period of the projects. Experience and expectations regarding future market development are included in this planning. The cost of capital rates are based on the concept of weighted average cost of capital (WACC). A post-tax calculation of the value in use is carried out by discounting the cash flows at a cost of capital rate calculated separately for each cash-generating unit after tax. A perpetuity with a growth rate of 2.0% has been assumed.\n\nPurchased **intangible assets** are measured at amortised cost. These include software for commercial and technical applications only. Intangible assets are generally amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years. Internally generated intangible assets include in-house software and are measured at production cost less scheduled depreciation and amortisation over a useful life of three years. The useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed every year.\n\n**Property, plant and equipment** are recognised at amortised costs. These costs only include costs that are directly attributable to an item in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of three to eight years. The useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed every year.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised for tangible and intangible assets if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. If the reason for an earlier loss in value no longer exists, the asset is reversed at amortised cost.\n\n**Leases** are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 16. At the time of provision of the leased property, the right of use is recognised as an asset and the associated payment obligation is recognised as a leasing liability in the statement of financial position. The right of use is amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the economic useful life of the leased asset. Payment obligations are discounted using the appropriate marginal cost of capital rate. Discounting is generally calculated using term and currency-specific marginal borrowing cost of capital rates, unless the interest rate underlying the lease payments is available. Each lease payment is divided into repayments and interest expenses. Interest expenses are recognised in profit or loss over the term of the lease.\n\nThis accounting does not include short-term leases with a term of no longer than twelve months and leases where the asset underlying the lease agreement is of low value The value limit is €5 thousand. Such agreements are recognised in profit or loss at the time of payment. In addition, rights of use of intangible assets are excluded from the scope of application. These are separated in contracts that include lease components and non-lease components, except in the case of insignificant asset classes.\n\nThe Instone Group also generates a small amount of income from leases through the acquisition of leased existing real estate that is intended for demolition or redevelopment. No specific long-term income is expected from these leases, as the aim of the Instone Group is to terminate the leases.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n#### [Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Shares accounted for using the equity method** are valued at acquisition cost and are recognised pro rata to the net assets in subsequent periods. The full carrying amount is tested annually for impairment; withdrawals and other changes in equity increase or reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Interests accounted for using the equity method are then impaired if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount.\n\n**Other investments** include investments and securities that fall exclusively in the valuation category \"Fair value through profit and loss\". They are measured at fair value.\n\n**Other financial assets** include financial receivables, trade receivables and other receivables and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (taking into account factors such as surcharges and rebates). Non-interest-bearing or low-interest loans are initially recognised at their discounted amount using a current market interest rate and subsequently carried forward using the effective interest method. Impairment losses are recognised if there is an expected loss on the basis of the credit risk. The Instone Group uses the simplified value reduction model of IFRS 9 on all trade receivables and contract assets and therefore recognises the expected losses over the total term.\n\n**Deferred tax liabilities** arise due to temporary differences between the IFRS and tax statements of financial position of the various companies and as a result of the consolidation.\n\n**Deferred tax assets** are also recognised for tax refund claims arising from the anticipated utilisation of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years. Deferred tax liabilities must be capitalised if it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that the affiliated economic benefits can be claimed. Their amount is calculated on the basis of the tax rates which apply or are expected to apply at the time of adoption in the different countries. The German trade tax rates applicable to the various companies are taken as a basis within the Group. For all other purposes, deferred tax liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the time of reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other for each company or group of companies.\n\n**Inventories** are assets that are in production (work-in-progress) and for which no sales contract has yet been concluded. They are measured at acquisition and production cost. Acquisition and production cost includes the complete production-related costs. Borrowing costs for inventories that are part of the qualifying assets are capitalised as cost components. If the recoverable amount is lower than the capitalised costs on a specific reporting date, the lower recoverable amount is used. If the net realisable value of inventories increases as a result, the resulting gain must be recognised. This is done by increasing the changes in inventories. For the purpose of commercial presentation, the inventories from the individual larger project development measures are split into several sub-project development measures. This split has no impact on the measurement. Within the Group, the respective overall project is recognised as a special measure in the current assets. The risks arising from individual sub-project units can be compensated by opportunities from other sub-projects. An impairment requirement beyond the carrying amount is taken into account by recognising a provision for contingent losses.\n\nPlanning costs included in acquisition and production cost are recognised directly as an expense in the event of significant rescheduling that constitutes a planning error.\n\nReceivables and payables from individually negotiated customer contracts are presented under **contract assets** and **contract liabilities**. These receivables and liabilities are accounted for and measured in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\".\n\nThe Company's customer contracts meet the criteria for identifying a contract under IFRS 15. For measurement purposes, the respective potentially separable performance obligations in the respective contracts are combined into one performance obligation as there is no individual benefit for the customer from separate performance obligations and the contracts do not provide for the transfer of separate benefit obligations. Subsequently agreed special requests of the customer are also added to the single performance obligation.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe contracts are generally regarded as fixed price contracts. Subsequent special requests are added to the fixed price. If the sale of several residential units in a contract is combined in multi-level marketing, a separate fixed price is agreed in the contract for each residential unit. In the case of investor distribution, contracts are always concluded with fixed prices listed separately if the performance obligation of the contract involves several buildings with separate construction phases. In addition to the generally agreed fixed price, the contracts involving investor distribution contain, in some cases, an adjustment clause at a fixed price on the basis of the constructed living space after final completion. In other cases, the purchase price for an investor contract can be based on the construction cost index. The contracts for the sale of residential real estate are generally valued according to revenue recognition over time. In the case of contracts in individual sales, there is usually a bilateral right of withdrawal up to a marketing quota of 30% of the residential units of a construction phase so that revenue recognition over a period of time only begins after this quota has been reached. Otherwise, in the case of contracts in the area of structured sales or investor distribution, the revenue recognition over time begins directly upon effectiveness of the contract. The agreed fixed price is generally accepted as a basis for the expected revenues for all contracts, as the adjustment to the constructed living space is not clearly identifiable before completion in the case of investor contracts. Performance progress is determined according to the input-oriented cost-to-cost method on the basis of the performance status of the compliance costs. For the calculation of the costs, a separate project account is kept for each phase of construction in which the costs are recorded and compared with the planned costs. In the case of contracts in individual sales and structure sales, the marketing quota of the construction section is included in the measurement in addition to the performance progress. The unsold portion of the construction stage is valued as inventories in accordance with IAS 2.\n\nContracts with individual and structured sales are generally concluded with an instalment payment plan in accordance with the Broker and Developer Regulations (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung; MaBV). As a rule, for contracts involving investor distribution, instalment payment plans are also agreed based on the MaBV regulations.\n\nIn contract assets and contract liabilities, the advance payments received from customers against the contracts concluded are netted with the receivables from the performance of the contract. As a general rule, the settlement receivables exceed the advance payments received for the contract and the net value is recognised as a contract asset. In individual cases, advance payments received may exceed the settlement receivables so that the netted value is shown as a contract liability.\n\nThe additional contract costs incurred are also capitalised in the \"Contract assets\" item in the statement of financial position. From the beginning of revenue recognition, the sales commissions incurred and capitalised so far are amortised in the income statement under cost of materials. Depreciation is measured at the fulfilment level so that contract costs remain capitalised on the part not yet fulfilled.\n\nReceivables and liabilities arising from customer contracts are realised in one single business cycle of the Instone Group. Consequently, they are classified as current assets or liabilities, even if the realisation of the entire construction contract takes more than one year.\n\nAs a general rule, the contracts with customers of Instone Group do not provide for redemption obligations and guarantees beyond the statutory framework. In individual cases, contracts with corresponding rights of withdrawal are concluded.\n\n**Government grants** are recognised at fair value at the time when there is sufficient certainty that the conditions associated with the grant will be met and that the grant will be received. In the statement of financial position, receivables from these grants are shown under Other receivables. The grants are presented as current assets because the receipt and use of the grants are linked to the contract assets and inventories, which are also presented as current. Liabilities from government grants are presented under Other liabilities. Grants for units already sold are collected in accordance with the progress of construction and recognised in the income statement in the periods in which the corresponding expenses, which are to be compensated by the government grant, are recognised as expenses. Income grants from KfW funding programmes are recognised in the Instone Group as government grants. They are presented in the income statement under Other operating income.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nLoans that include government grants in the form of partial debt relief and discounted interest rates are carried as financial liabilities at fair value and subsequently carried forward at amortised cost. At the time of disbursement of a loan that includes government grants, the amount of funding from the loan is reclassified to Other liabilities and collected in accordance with the progress of construction of the sold units.\n\nIf it is not probable that the requirements associated with the grant will be met, the balance sheet items associated with the grants will be reversed and recognised in profit or loss.\n\n**Liquid funds** (cash and cash equivalents) exist in the form of bank balances. In the previous year, they also existed in the form of cash on hand. They also include all capital investments with a residual maturity at the acquisition date of up to three months. Cash and cash equivalents are valued at their nominal value.\n\n**Treasury shares** are deducted from equity at the value of the consideration paid, including directly attributable incidental costs. If these units are issued again, the difference between the acquisition cost and the issue price is posted to the capital reserve in the event of increased proceeds and deducted from the revenue reserves in the event of reduced proceeds. Acquisition cost is determined using the average cost method as the consumption tracking method.\n\n**Provisions** are made for all legal and constructive liabilities to third parties existing on the closing date from transactions concluded in the past that are likely to result in the disposal of resources which can be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions are recognised at their anticipated settlement value and are not offset against reimbursement claims. All non-current provisions are recognised at their anticipated settlement value and discounted to the reporting date of the annual financial statements. Furthermore, all cost increases that count towards the settlement date are taken into account when calculating this amount.\n\n**Provisions for pensions and similar obligations** are recognised for defined benefit plans. These include obligations of the Company with respect to current and future benefits to eligible active and former employees and their survivors. These obligations largely relate to pension benefits. The individual commitments are determined on the basis of the length of service and the salaries of the employees. The measurement of provisions for defined benefit plans is based on the actuarial value of the respective obligation. This is determined using the projected unit credit method. This projected unit credit method not only includes pensions and accrued benefits known as of the reporting date but also wage increases and pension increases expected in the future. The calculation is based on actuarial reports using biometric calculation methods (primarily the \"Richttafeln 2018 G\" (Mortality Tables) of Klaus Heubeck).\n\nThe provision is calculated on the basis of the actuarial present value of the obligation and the fair value of the plan assets required to settle the pension obligation. The service cost is included in staff costs. The net interest income is part of the finance income. Gains and losses from the revaluation of net liabilities or net assets are recognised in full in the period in which they arise. They are presented in equity, are not recognised in profit or loss and are not presented in the consolidated income statement. In subsequent years they are also not shown in the profits and losses.\n\nThe Instone Group makes no further commitments for defined contribution plans that would exceed the contributions paid to Special Funds. The contributions are recorded as staff costs.\n\nAll **other provisions** take into account all identifiable risks. They are recognised at the amount required on the basis of prudent business judgement to meet future payment obligations of the Instone Group. In this context, the amount that appears most likely is used, taking into account the individual case.\n\n**Share-based remuneration** is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2. These provisions cover the non-current share-based compensation programmes with cash settlement and the issue of employee shares. Liabilities from non-current share-based incentive plans are measured at their fair value and presented under personnel provisions.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Non-current loans** recognised in financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost. Interest-bearing loans at normal market rates are recognised at their face value.\n\nNon-derivative **financial liabilities** (including trade payables) are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method in accordance with IFRS 9. Initial measurement is at fair value including transaction costs.\n\n**Liabilities from net assets attributable to non-controlling interests** relate to the limited partner share of minority shareholders. Upon being acquired by the Instone Group, they are recognised in other comprehensive income as liabilities measured at the present value of the repayment amount. Subsequent measurement is through profit and loss.\n\n**Income tax liabilities** include obligations to pay current income tax. Income tax liabilities are offset against the corresponding tax refund claims if they exist in the same jurisdiction and are identical in terms of their type and due date.\n\n**Contingent liabilities** are potential obligations to third parties arising from events that have already taken place and that cannot be fully controlled by the Company, or existing obligations to third parties that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources or whose amount cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not generally shown in the statement of financial position.\n\n**Earnings per share** are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the shareholders of the Instone Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n#### Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of the Instone Group's accounting policies, as well as recognition and measurement. Estimates are based on past experience and other knowledge of the transactions to be posted. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates are particularly required for the measurement of inventories and contract assets, particularly the estimate of the total costs and the sales revenues, the allocation of purchase prices, the effectiveness of sales contracts, the granting of pending approvals, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets, the allocation of trade payables and contract liabilities, the recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-214-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **Segment reporting**\n\nSegment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 is based on the management approach and thus corresponds to the management and reporting system that the Instone Group uses for its segments. The Instone Group operates in only one operating segment and one geographical segment. It generates its revenue and holds its assets mainly in Germany. In the 2023 financial year, the Instone Group generated revenue with one customer representing 14.42% (previous year: 16.38%) of the reported total revenue. This was equivalent to €74,170 thousand (previous year: €92,978 thousand). Due to the homogeneity of the services provided to this customer and the other customers, only one operating segment is presented, as in the previous years.\n\nHowever, the internal reporting for the single operating segment differs from the figures in IFRS accounting. In its internal reporting, the Instone Group focuses in particular on the development of housing projects. For this reason, the Instone Group conducts segment reporting for this one operating segment.\n\nInternal corporate governance for this segment is based in particular on the internal reporting system for the presentation of key developments relating to real estate business and financial business key performance indicators, supplemented by an examination of key project milestones and liquidity development.\n\nThe Instone Group manages its segment through the adjusted results of operations using key performance indicators of adjusted revenue, adjusted gross profit and adjusted earnings after interest and tax.\n\n#### **Adjusted revenue**\n\nThe performance of the operating segment is reported via adjusted revenue on the basis of revenue recognition at a point in time or over time according to IFRS. Adjusted revenue is calculated by adding the revenue recognition from share deals in the same way as from asset deals, without the effects from purchase price allocations.\n\n#### **Adjusted gross profit**\n\nThe adjusted gross profit is used to analyse the project-based company performance and is determined on the basis of the adjusted revenue less the cost of materials, changes in inventories, other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials, indirect distribution costs and capitalised interest, but excluding effects from purchase price allocations, share deals and non recurring effects.\n\n#### **Adjusted earnings after tax**\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax is calculated on the basis of adjusted gross profit less platform costs, consisting of staff costs, other operating income and expenses, depreciation and amortisation, investment and other income, financial result and income taxes, but is also adjusted for the effects from purchase price allocations and share deals, as well as any non-recurring effects, where applicable. Since the 2020 financial year, the results of joint ventures are included in adjusted earnings before interest and tax, as future earnings of project companies to be recorded under this item are to be allocated to operating earnings.\n\nThe effects of the adjusted results of operations are derived from the following:\n\n#### Share deal effects\n\nThe project companies Westville 2 GmbH, Westville 3 GmbH, Westville 4 GmbH and Westville 5 GmbH are conceived as asset management companies under German commercial law and constitute one major project in Frankfurt am Main. The Instone Group has already sold these project companies in the form of a share deal with the obligation to build a residential complex. In the adjusted results of operations, the overall \"Westville\" project is managed in the same way as the other projects in the Instone Group, with revenue recognition over time in accordance with IFRS 15. These companies are valued and included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 2. The effects from this different valuation are reflected in the revenue of €99,103 thousand (previous year: €49,562 thousand), project costs of €88,005 thousand (previous year: €50,640 thousand) and income taxes of €1,904 thousand (previous year: €185 thousand).\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Effects from purchase price allocations\n\nDue to the first-time consolidation of Instone Real Estate Development GmbH in 2014 and Instone Real Estate Leipzig GmbH in 2015 as well as the business activities of S&P Stadtbau GmbH in 2019, as of 31 December 2023 inventories and contract assets still included writeups of €11,495 thousand (previous year: €17,098thousand) from purchase price allocations. The ongoing amortisation of these purchase price allocations on the basis of the progressive implementation of the projects included in these initial consolidations is adjusted for internal reporting. The adjustment for the amortisation of purchase price allocations was attributable as follows: €2,593 thousand (previous year: €3,932 thousand) to revenue, €-3,010 thousand (previous year: €-10,328 thousand) to changes in inventories and reduced to €1,635 thousand (previous year: €-4,512 thousand) to income taxes. Based on current estimates, the Instone Group expects these effects to expire in 2025.\n\n#### Reclassifications and non-recurring effects\n\nIn the year under review, indirect sales expenses amounting to €2,399 thousand (previous year: €2,811 thousand) were allocated to project costs.\n\nIn the year under review, one-time expenses in connection with the valuation of inventories to €-17,695 thousand were recognised. As these are unusual in their amount and cannot be regarded as recurring, they have been adjusted as a special effect.\n\nIn addition, other operating expenses in the amount of €-3,802 thousand were adjusted as non-recurring expenses. In the financial year, other operating income after subtracting the cost of materials (income opposed by a directly attributable item in cost of materials) in the amount of €15,105 thousand (previous year: €10,176 thousand) was reclassified to project costs. The adjustment of the capitalised interest in the changes in inventories of €12,228 thousand (previous year: €3,231 thousand) burdened the project costs.\n\nIn the following table, the differences arising from the valuation of the individual data are carried over from the adjusted results of operations to the consolidated reporting:\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Reconciliation of adjusted results of operations in 2023 TABLE 051**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n**T**\n\n| To our

Goodwill is not depreciated on schedule, but is subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 once a year, and whenever certain indicators point to a potential impairment loss. Goodwill is fully non-tax-deductible.\n\nThe goodwill of fully consolidated companies, which was capitalised as part of the initial consolidation, has been allocated to the relevant branch as cash-generating units in order to carry out impairment tests.\n\nThe discount rates for the cash-generating unit Bavaria North, which are used as part of the impairment tests, are 8.38% after taxes (previous year: 8.85%) and before tax at 12.23% (previous year: 12.92%).\n\nA comparison of the recoverable amounts of the branch with their carrying amount resulted in a surplus and there is therefore no need for a devaluation for goodwill. A sensitivity analysis of key parameters also did not lead to any deviating results.\n\n#### 12 Intangible assets\n\nAs in the previous year, intangible assets are not subject to any limitations on disposal. They include €221 thousand (previous year: €877 thousand) capitalised development costs, the production of which was already completed as of the reporting date, and €11 thousand (previous year: €63 thousand) concessions and industrial property rights.\n\n| Intangible assets                          |       | TABLE 066 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| In thousands of euros                      |       |           |\n|                                            | 2023  | 2022      |\n| Acquisition costs as of 1 January          | 1,725 | 1,714     |\n| Additions                                  | 0     | 12        |\n| Acquisition costs as of 31 December        | 1,725 | 1,725     |\n| Accumulated depreciation as of 1 January   | 786   | 267       |\n| Additions                                  | 707   | 519       |\n| Accumulated depreciation as of 31 December | 1,493 | 786       |\n|                                            | 232   | 940       |\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### 13 Right of use assets\n\nThe right of use assets recognised relate to real estate, inheritable building rights to project development properties, construction site equipment, passenger cars and construction site containers.

inventories of €971,911 thousand (previous year: €847,523 can only be realised after more than twelve months.\n\nThe inventories were subject to impairments of €22,272 thousand (previous year: €12,216thousand) and writedowns of 1,900 thousand. (previous year: €1,770 thousand).\n\nIn the financial year, planning costs capitalised as acquisition and production costs were derecognised due to rescheduling in the amount of €17,695 thousand.\n\n#### 18 Financial receivables\n\nThe financial receivables are as follows:\n\n| Financial receivables                                          |            | TABLE 074  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| In thousands of euros                                          |            |            |\n|                                                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Non-current                                                    |            |            |\n| Loans to joint ventures/other investments                      | 10,256     | 18,978     |\n| Other loans                                                    | 40         | 15         |\n|                                                                | 10,296     | 18,993     |\n| Current                                                        |            |            |\n| Loans to joint ventures/other investments                      | 19,919     | 60         |\n| Other loans                                                    | 35         | 35         |\n| Financial receivables from<br>joint ventures/other investments | 2,871      | 105        |\n| Other financial receivables                                    | 484        | 463        |\n|                                                                | 23,309     | 663        |\n|                                                                | 33,604     | 19,656     |\n\nThe increase in current financial receivables mainly relates to short-term loans to joint ventures and results primarily from the deconsolidation of Projekt Am Sonnenberg Wiesbaden GmbH.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 19 Contract assets\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n| The structure of contract assets is composed as follows: |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                          |          |\n| Contract assets                                          | TABLE 07 |\n\n| In thousands of euros                  |            |            |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                        | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Contract assets                        | 603,248    | 847,923    |\n| Payments received                      | -430,136   | -519,638   |\n|                                        | 173,112    | 328,284    |\n| Capitalised costs to obtain a contract | 3,957      | 5,301      |\n|                                        | 177,069    | 333,585    |\n\nThe change in contract assets results firstly from the higher number of transfers of residential real estate in the year under report and, secondly, from the reduced volume of sales contracts.\n\nThe cycle of contract assets is – equivalent to the project term – an average of three years.\n\nThe amortisation of the costs to obtain a contract in the amount of €1,439 thousand (previous year: €2,013 thousand) offsets the fulfilment of the underlying contracts with customers.\n\n#### 20 Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables amounted to €6,467 thousand as of the reporting date (previous year: €2,778 thousand).

In addition, conversions of projects due to these changes were corrected according to the corresponding receivables. In addition, the decrease in the success-based income is also due to pledged public grants already being accepted.\n\nIt is expected that, other than receivables from government grants and deposits, upfront payments on land and deposits, no other receivables or other assets can be realised after more than twelve months.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n22 Income tax assets\n\nReceivables from domestic and foreign tax authorities during the ordinary course of business amounted to €4,302 thousand as of the reporting date (previous year: €710 thousand).\n\n#### 23 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| Cash and cash equivalents |            | TABLE 077  |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| In thousands of euros     |            |            |\n|                           | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Bank balances             | 383,605    | 255,584    |\n| Cash                      | 0          | 8          |\n|                           | 383,605    | 255,592    |\n| of which restricted       | 119,256    | 12,600     |\n\nThe restrictions on the disposal of cash and cash equivalents result from project financing not yet completed by banks.\n\n#### 24 Equity\n\nThe registered capital of the Company as of 31 December 2023 was €46,988 thousand(previous year: €46,988thousand) and is fully paid up.

The earnings after tax attributable to noncontrolling interests amounts to €-1,144 thousand (previous year: €-814 thousand).\n\n#### 25 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\nThe existing pension plans of the Instone Group consist of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the Company makes payments to a state or private pension scheme, either on a statutory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company is not legally obliged to make any further payments.\n\nUnder the defined benefit plans, the Company is required to pay the promised benefits to existing and former employees. A distinction is made between plans financed by provisions or by external financing.\n\nThe pension plan available at the Instone Group consists of a basic pension financed by the Group companies in the form of a modular defined contribution plan and an additional pension component linked to the economic success of the Company. In accordance with IAS 19, the corresponding commitments are recognised as liabilities from defined benefit plans[. GRI 201-3](#page-286-0)\n\nThe liabilities from defined benefit plans of the Instone Group are as follows:\n\n#### **Liabilities from defined benefit plans TABLE 079**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n|                                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Active employees, not dependent on remuneration | 4,569      | 3,816      |\n| Vested claims                                   | 3,906      | 3,636      |\n| Ongoing pensions                                | 1,905      | 1,267      |\n|                                                 | 10,380     | 8,720      |\n\nThe average remaining time in service of the eligible active employees was 11.98 years as of the reporting date (previous year: 13.23 years).\n\nThe pension obligations are financed by the purchase of units in mutual funds. The obligations financed by Helaba Pension Trust e.V. account for 85.7% (previous year: 93.2%) of the total insurance coverage; total coverage is 90.4% (previous year: 98.5%).

The main risks are due to general changes in interest rates and inflation rates. There are no unusual risks associated with the pension obligations.\n\nInterest rate risk: The (mathematical) contributions are converted into benefits within the scope of a defined contribution pension plan using a table of fixed interest rates that are not dependent on actual market interest rates. The Instone Group therefore bears the risk arising from the general capital market interest rates with regard to determining benefits. The pension obligations decreased significantly in the year under review due to the generally higher interest rates in the capital market. The comparatively strong effect results from the relatively long duration of the obligations.\n\nInflation risk: According to legislation, the benefits of occupational pensions in Germany must be adjusted to inflation trends every three years. The 2000+ pension plan obligations in Germany under occupational pension schemes increase by 1% each year and other occupational pension obligations are only minor; therefore, there is little inflation risk during the retirement phase with regard to non-current pension commitments.\n\nLongevity risk: As a retirement provision is granted for a lifetime, there is a risk that beneficiaries will live longer than originally anticipated, with the Instone Group bearing the corresponding risk. In general, this risk balances out across all beneficiaries and only has an impact if the overall lifetime is longer than originally thought.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the possible impact of the stated risks when changing the actuarial assumptions to the obligations under a defined benefit pension plan:\n\n| Sensitivity analysis                     |            |          |

A possible LTI bonus depends on the achievement of company-related financial targets and nonfinancial ESG targets and the share price performance, taking into account distributions during the performance period. The contractually agreed base amount – an individually determined base amount for each member of the Management Board on which the calculation is based – is based on the average volume-weighted Instone Group share price over the last three months before the start of the performance period. At the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board determines whether the targets have been achieved.

Nyoo Real Estate GmbH, headquartered in Essen, Germany and registered in the Commercial Register of the Essen District Court under HRB 30620, complies with the requirements set out in Section 264(3) HGB and is therefore exempt from the publication and auditing of annual financial statements and the preparation and auditing of a management report.\n\n#### Reporting on financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual rights and obligations relating to the exchange and transfer of financial assets. There are no derivative financial instruments.\n\nFinancial assets mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. Most of the financial liabilities are current liabilities which are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe available financial instruments are shown in the statement of financial position. The maximum loss or default risk equals the sum total of financial assets. Any risk identified for financial assets is recognised at its impairment charge.\n\n#### Risk management\n\nAll of the Instone Group's financial activities are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial policy. There are also function-specific operational work instructions on topics such as the handling of collateral.\n\nThese guidelines contain the principles used to address the different types of financial risks.\n\nTrading, controlling and billing are handled separately by the front and back office. This ensures effective risk management. The monitoring and billing of the external trading activities of the Front Office is carried out by a separate and independent back office. Furthermore, the dual control principle must be maintained at least for all external trading activities. Internal powers to issue instructions are limited in number and amount, reviewed regularly (at least once a year) and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe Instone Group considers the interests of shareholders, promissory note investors and the issuing banks in its financial management. Financial and non-financial covenants arise from the contractual conditions of the promissory note loans, the fixed term loan and the syndicated loan. The covenants include compliance with the leverage, the interest rate, equity and loan to value. The potential financial risks resulting from the contractual conditions were not considered to be material as of the reporting date 31 December 2023. The loans are not secured and the Instone Group complied with all obligations in this regard in the financial year as well as in the previous year. For the subsequent periods, the Instone Group monitors the future development as part of Group-wide financial risk management and also continues to anticipate compliance with the contractual terms. This assessment remains unchanged in light of the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n#### Management of liquidity risk\n\nThe Instone Group uses largely centralised structures for pooling cash and cash equivalents at Group level to avoid, among other things, bottlenecks in cash flow at individual Group company level. The central liquidity position is calculated monthly and using a bottom-up method over a rolling twelve-month period. The liquidity planning is supplemented by monthly stress tests.\n\nThe following tables show the contractually agreed residual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods that apply to the Instone Group. The tables are recorded on the basis of the non-discounted cash flows of the financial liabilities with the date which the Instone Group can be asked to repay. The tables contain the cash flow from interest and principal receivable.\n\nInterest payments for items with variable rates are uniformly translated using the last interest rate in effect before the key date.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2023 includes promissory note loans issued from the years 2019 (nominal value: €5,000 thousand), 2020 (nominal value: €100,000 thousand), 2022 (nominal value: €50,000 thousand) and 2023 (nominal value:€20,000 thousand). These financial liabilities are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Impairment losses are recognised if there is an expected loss on the basis of the credit risk. The Instone Group uses the simplified value reduction model of IFRS 9 on all trade receivables, as well as contract assets and therefore records the expected losses over the total term.\n\nThe maximum default risk from financial assets corresponds to their respective carrying amounts stated in the statement of financial position. However, the de facto default risk is lower, as collateral has been provided in favour of the Instone Group. The maximum risk from financial guarantees is equal to the maximum amount that the Instone Group would have to pay. The maximum default risk from loan commitments is equal to the amount of the commitment. We consider it highly unlikely at the time of reporting that these financial guarantees and loan commitments would be used.\n\nThe Instone Group accepts collateral to secure the fulfilment of the contract by subcontractors, the warranty provisions of the subcontractors and fee claims. These securities include, but are not limited to, warranty guarantees, contract performance guarantees, advance payments and payment guarantees. The Instone Group has relevant guidelines for the acceptance of collateral. They include, among other things, rules on contract structure, contract implementation and contract management for all contracts. The exact specifications vary and depend, for example, on the country, jurisdiction and current case law. With regard to default risks, the Instone Group checks the creditworthiness of the guaranteeing party for all accepted collateral. The Instone Group engages external experts (such as rating agencies) to assess their creditworthiness as much as possible. The fair value of accepted collateral is not disclosed, as it cannot usually be determined reliably.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe age structure of overdue financial assets is typical for the sector. The receipt of a payment depends on the order acceptance and invoice verification, which often take a relatively long time. Contract assets are not subject to impairment.\n\nThe ongoing changes in the 2023 financial year are based on additions, liquidations and utilisations and amount to €374 thousand (previous year: €966thousand) meaning that, as at 31 December 2023, there is an impairment loss on trade receivables of €421 thousand (previous year: €849 thousand).\n\nThe following table shows the overdue and non-overdue, impaired financial assets:\n\n#### **Impairments pursuant to IFRS 9 in 2023 TABLE 101**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n| In thousands of euros                     |                 |             |                          |                          |                          |                              |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--|\n|                                           | Carrying amount | Non-overdue | Up to 30<br>days overdue | 31 to 60<br>days overdue | 61 to 90<br>days overdue | More than 90<br>days overdue |  |\n| Trade receivables (gross carrying amount) | 6,889           | 4,433       | 77                       | 101                      | 20                       | 2,258                        |  |\n| Impairment provisions                     | -421            | -43         | -1                       | -1                       | 0                        | -376                         |  |\n| Trade receivables (net carrying amount)   | 6,467           | 4,390       | 76                       | 100                      | 20                       | 1,882                        |  |\n\n#### **Impairments pursuant to IFRS 9 in 2022 TABLE 102**\n\n| In thousands of euros                     |                 |             |                          |                          |                          |                              |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                           | Carrying amount | Non-overdue | Up to 30<br>days overdue | 31 to 60<br>days overdue | 61 to 90<br>days overdue | More than 90<br>days overdue |\n| Trade receivables (gross carrying amount) | 3,627           | 1,322       | 460                      | 34                       | 39                       | 1,772                        |\n| Impairment provisions                     | -849            | -13         | -5                       | 0                        | 0                        | -831                         |\n| Trade receivables (net carrying amount)   | 2,778           | 1,309       | 455                      | 34                       | 39                       | 941                          |\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n[Consolidated income](#page-199-0)  statement\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-200-0)  of comprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-201-0)  of financial position\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-203-0)  of cash flows\n\n[Consolidated statement](#page-205-0)  of changes in equity\n\n **[Notes to the consolidated](#page-206-0)  financial statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Control of interest rate risks\n\nThe interest rate risk of the Instone Group is mainly related to current and non-current interest bearing financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Depending on the situation in the market, this risk is countered by a mix of fixed income and variable interest rate financial instruments. The risk is not managed separately, as borrowed funds are usually repaid promptly using the payments made by the acquirers.\n\nChanges in market interest rates for non-derivative financial instruments with a fixed interest rate are only recognised in profit or loss if they are measured at fair value. For this reason, all financial instruments recognised at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risks as defined by IFRS 9.\n\nAs part of a sensitivity analysis, we examined the effects of changes in market interest rates on consolidated earnings after tax over a range of 100 basis points. In the financial year, a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by 100 basis points (provided other variables remain constant) would result in an increase or decrease of consolidated earnings of €2,219 thousand (previous year: decrease in consolidated earnings of €1,742 thousand or increase in consolidated earnings of €910 thousand).\n\n#### Control of the capital risk\n\nThe Instone Group manages its capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies continue to operate on a going concern basis. The Instone Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible. It achieves this by optimising the ratio of equity to debt on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of current and non-current liabilities less the cash and cash equivalents reported in the statement of financial position and in equity. The capital structure of the Group is reviewed regularly. The risk-adjusted capital costs are also taken into account.\n\nThe overall strategy for controlling the capital risk did not change in the financial year compared to the previous year.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### Further disclosures on financial instruments\n\n#### **[To our

information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWith the short-term financial instruments accounted for at amortised costs, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value, due to the short remaining term to maturity. In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the carrying amount of a part corresponds to the fair value due to the variable interest rate. A fair value was determined for the fixed-interest non-current liabilities, which exceeds the carrying amount by €4,272 thousand as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: €-17,493 thousand). Non-current fixed-interest liabilities are assigned to\n\nlevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value was determined using a cash value method using company-specific current interest rates derived from the market. Non-current financial receivables are recognised at amortised costs. Their fair value differs from the carrying amount by €73 thousand (previous year: €-506 thousand).

We have not audited the contents of the references to texts extraneous to the notes of the consolidated financial statements marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the General Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively. In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the parent and the group of Instone Real Estate Group SE, Essen/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the corporate governance statement in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d German Commercial Code (HGB) included in section \"Other information\" of the combined management report, including the further reporting on corporate governance included therein. Further-more, we have neither audited the contents of the \"Sustainability report\" included in the combined management report nor the references to texts extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- → the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023; our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the references extraneous to the notes of the consolidated financial statements as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively, and\n- → the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the the con-tents of section \"Sustainability report\" and the afore-mentioned corporate governance statement including the further reporting on corporate governance included therein as well as the references extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nand German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following we present the over time revenue recognition including the valuation of contract assets or inventories, which we have determined to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\na. description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)\n\nb. auditor's response\n\n#### Over time revenue recognition including the valuation of contract assets or inventories\n\na. The consolidated financial statements of Instone Real Estate Group SE, Essen/Germany, as at 31 December 2023 disclosed contract assets of kEUR 177,069, inventories of kEUR 1,085,840 and revenue of kEUR 503,496 arising from the development of residential and multifamily houses, from the creation of concepts for urban quarters, from the reconstruction of heritage-protected properties as well as from governmentally-subsidised housing construction (real estate developer activities) in Germany. In application of the provisions of IFRS 15 on revenue realisation, sold units under development are realised according to over time revenue recognition. In this respect, the service rendered including the proportionate result is disclosed in revenue corresponding to the level of completion. With the exception of reconstruction properties, revenue for these matters is generally recognised as soon as the respective project has reached a marketing level of 30%. The contractually conceded right to withdraw expires for both parties as of this point in time. In the case of reconstruction properties, revenue is recognised when construction activities begin.\n\nThe amount of revenue realised for a construction project as well as the measurement of contract assets and inventories depend on the following parameters:\n\n- → Marketing level\n- → Level of completion as well as actual costs incurred as at the balance sheet date\n- → Estimation of total income and total costs\n\nWhile the marketed parts of the construction projects are disclosed under contract assets after balancing with prepayments received or alternatively under contract liabilities, non-marketed parts of construction projects are disclosed under inventories.\n\nRevenue realisation and the measurement of contract assets and inventories is – to an extraordinary extent – based on the executive directors' estimations and assumptions regarding the amount of total costs, deferral of costs as at the balance sheet date as well as the estimation of total revenue of the respective project. The executive\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\ndirectors' estimations subject to judgement have a direct and predominantly significant effect on the amount of revenue realised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and the amount of contract assets and inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nHence, we have deemed this matter to be a key audit matter.\n\nInformation on the revenue realisation as well as on the measurement of contract assets and inventories were presented by the executive directors in the section \"Basis of the consolidated financial statements\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb. When auditing revenue, contract assets and inventories, we assessed the recognition method applied and – involving internal specialists – assessed the measurement in compliance with the regulations of IFRS 15. During our audit, we have recorded the main processes from project acceptance (acquisition of a property) to project conclusion (construction activities and sale of the individual flats) as well as the procedure on the monthly deferral of costs and examined relevant control procedures on appropriateness and effectiveness. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. Based on a risk-oriented sample selection, we have conducted site visits of projects and based on which we reviewed the estimations and assumptions made by the executive directors as at the balance sheet date. We verified the deferral of expenses by reference to appropriate evidence based on a random sample selection. In addition, we have examined the plausibility of the deferral entries made as at the balance sheet date. We have assessed the projected total revenue and total expenses by involving internal specialists and their professional and industry expertise. We have assessed relevant disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding completeness and accuracy.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises\n\n→ the report of the supervisory board,\n\n- → the corporate governance statement, including the further reporting on corporate governance included there-in, in section \"Corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report,\n- → the references in the combined management report and in the consolidated notes to the financial statements marked as unaudited as regards the provisions of the GRI as well as of the TCFD each labelled with the GRI or TCFD symbol, respectively,\n- → the \"Sustainability report\" section included in the combined management report,\n- → the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and\n- → all other parts of the annual report,\n- → but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) concerning the German Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the corporate governance statement included in section \"Corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report. Otherwise the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n→ is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n\n→ otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to pro-vide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\n{260}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n- **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n- **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- → identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- → obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- → evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- → conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- → evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial\n\nstatements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\n- → obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- → evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- → perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions.

In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" above, we do not ex-press any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB and on the basis of the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AuS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has applied the requirements of the IDW Quality Management Standards.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents**\n\nThe executive directors of the parent are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the parent are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents**\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB.

The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register – are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a consolidated non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have laid down their own interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated non-financial statement. They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the consolidated non-financial statement is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made.\n\n#### **Independence and quality assurance of the German Public Audit Firm**\n\nWe have observed German professional regulations as well as further professional rules of conduct.\n\nOur firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements – particularly of the \"Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors\" (BS WP/vBP) and of the Quality Management Standards promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated nonfinancial statement based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\", issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated nonfinancial statement.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between November 2023 and March 2024, we performed, among others, the following procedures and other work:\n\n- → Gaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organisation and of the stakeholder engagement\n- → Inquiries of the executive directors as well as relevant employees involved in the preparation of the consolidated non-financial statement regarding the preparation process including precautions and measures taken to prepare the consolidated non-financial statement as well as the disclosures made in the consolidated nonfinancial statement\n- → Assessment of the professional derivation and of the assessment of material business transactions in the context of the EU Taxonomy Regulations regarding the appropriateness of the respective reporting\n- → Identification of the risks of material misstatement within the consolidated non-financial statement\n- → Analytical assessment of disclosures within the consolidated nonfinancial statement\n- → Cross validation of selected disclosures and the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements as well as in the combined management report\n- → Assessment and presentation of the disclosures on sustainability\n- → Assessment of the process to identify taxonomy eligible and taxonomyaligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. The legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\n#### **Practitioner's conclusion**\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated nonfinancial statement of Instone Real Estate Group SE for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 does not comply, in all material respects, with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the consolidated non-financial statement.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThis conclusion solely relates to the text passages in the section \"Sustainability Report\" of Instone Real Estate Group SE's combined management report that are marked with the icon (\" \").

We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was performed for the purposes of the Company and the report is solely designed for informing the Company about the findings of the assurance engagement. Therefore, it may not be suitable for another than the aforementioned purpose. Accordingly, this report is not intended to be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision.\n\nWe are solely responsible toward the Company.

In doing so, it also takes into account the requirements of the German Accounting Standard No. 17 (DRS) and the HGB.\n\n#### **I. Remuneration System for the Members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE**\n\nThe current remuneration system for the members of the Management Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE was approved by the Supervisory Board in the 2021 financial year and submitted to the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 9 June 2021, which approved the remuneration system described in this number I, which came into force as from 1 July 2021, with 98.27% voting to approve it. The complete [remuneration system is available at](http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html) ä http://ir.de.instone-group.de/websites/ instonereal/English/5930/verguetung.html.\n\nThe remuneration system is geared toward sustainable and long-term corporate development. Transparency and traceability of the remuneration system and the individual remuneration of the Management Board members are key components of good corporate governance at Instone Real Estate Group SE.\n\nThe remuneration system applies for a maximum period of four years to all new contract of employment concluded with members of the Management Board and for contract extensions and adjustments from 1 July 2021. Therefore, the employment contracts of members of the Management Board in place on the date on which the remuneration system came into force have been revised with effect from 1 July 2021 in accordance with the provisions and regulations of the new remuneration system. Remuneration claims established before 1 July 2021, including those relating to variable remuneration, therefore continue to be based on the contractual provisions on which they were based at the

Contribution of remuneration to supporting the business strategy and the long-term development of the company**\n\nThe calculation of the remuneration is mainly based on the size and complexity of the Instone Group, its economic situation and financial position, and its success and future prospects. Other material criteria for setting the remuneration include the duties and personal performance of the individual members of the Management Board. The remuneration system defines remuneration that is competitive in national and international comparison, which creates added value for customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders by defining performance criteria relating in particular to the long-term and sustainable success of the company and linking them with challenging targets. These targets set by the Supervisory Board for variable remuneration are in line with the corporate strategy and ensure the synchronisation of the remuneration of the Management Board and the long-term development of the company through a link with corporate planning.\n\n### **B. Procedures for Determining and Implementing the Remuneration of the Management Board and for Reviewing the Remuneration System**\n\nResponsibility for preparing the remuneration system, setting the actual total emoluments of the individual members of the Management Board and the regular review of the remuneration system lies with the Supervisory Board of Instone Real Estate Group SE. The Supervisory Board has set up a remuneration committee, which is responsible, in particular, for advising on the contracts of employment of the members of the Management Board and for preparing the relevant resolutions as well as preparing setting the targets for the variable remuneration components and their assessment by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system at regular intervals on the basis of the preparations and recommendations of the remuneration committee. If the Supervisory Board determines that action must be taken, it decides on any changes deemed necessary and the remuneration system is presented to the Annual General Meeting again for approval if required.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may call on external consultants to help it fulfil its duties and they must be independent of the Management Board and Instone Real Estate Group SE and has in fact done so for the preparation of the current remuneration system. The rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board contain provisions for dealing with potential conflicts of interest in the Supervisory Board , which include disclosure of potential conflicts of interest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board, a ban on participating and voting in the event of identified conflicts of interest and also apply to remuneration matters.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting shall decide on the remuneration system in the event of any significant change to the remuneration system but at least every four years. If the Annual General Meeting has not approved the remuneration system, a revised remuneration system must be submitted for approval to the next Annual General Meeting at the latest.\n\n### **C. Determination and Appropriateness of Remuneration**\n\nIn keeping with the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board has set the total target remuneration and relevant upper remuneration limits (caps) for each member of the Management Board. The remuneration is proportionate to the duties and performance of the Management Board member and to the situation of the Instone Group, will not exceed the usual remuneration without special reasons and is geared toward the long-term and sustainable development of the Instone Group. The appropriateness of the remuneration is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board. Both external and internal comparison analyses are carried out for this purpose.\n\n#### Consideration of Employee Remuneration and Employment Conditions and Peer Group Comparison\n\nThe internal analysis was carried out as part of the preparation of the current remuneration system in the form of a vertical comparison of the remuneration and employment conditions of employees. The remuneration levels of the members of the Management Board were set in relation to the remuneration levels of the senior management and the workforce as a whole. These two employee groups were defined by the Supervisory Board. The senior management includes the managing directors of the subsidiaries and the workforce as a whole is made up of the full-time employees of the Instone Group in Germany (including senior management). The results of the vertical comparison were taken into account in determining the remuneration system and future adjustments to the remuneration level of the Management Board – including its development over time.\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-269-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nTo develop the remuneration system and check the appropriateness of the remuneration conditions, the Supervisory Board also carried out an external comparative analysis of remuneration levels using two peer groups (industry and growth peer groups). The members of the industry peer group were selected on the basis of six criteria (company size, sector, in other words direct competitors or companies in other sectors with comparable characteristics – in particular real estate, land, legal form, equity market basis and relevant labour markets) on the premise that they are as comparable as possible with Instone Real Estate Group SE. Due to the considerable growth of the Instone Group since the IPO, a second growth peer group was also formed, which is comparable with Instone Real Estate Group SE in terms of sales growth rates, company size and region.\n\n#### **D. Remuneration Components**\n\nThe total remuneration of the individual members of the Management Board consists of various components. In terms of structure, the remuneration components for all members of the Management Board are regulated in the same way using estimates, since the amount of fringe benefits in particular may vary as part of the performance-independent remuneration:\n\n|                                                            | TABLE 10    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Annual target remuneration                                 | 100%        |\n| – of which non-performance related emoluments              | approx. 40% |\n| – of which performance-based emoluments – short-term (STI) | approx. 25% |\n| – of which performance-based emoluments – long-term (LTI)  | approx. 35% |\n\nThe remuneration of the Management Board consists of non-performancerelated salary and benefits in kind, performance-related (variable) remuneration and (in the case of two Management Board members) pension commitments agreed before their appointment to the Management Board, for which the additions by the Company up to 2020 correspond to an annual pension benefit from the age of 65, which is expected to be between 3% and 5% of the current annual basic remuneration that is independent of the performance of the company. Variable remuneration is based on a multi-year assessment basis in order to create incentives for sustainable and long-term corporate development. The remuneration system explicitly stipulates that both positive and negative developments are taken into account. The Supervisory Board also sets a maximum amount (cap) for each variable remuneration component. Management Board remuneration is highly performance-related, with a particular focus on long-term variable remuneration.\n\nThus, the STI bonus amounts to approximately 62.5% for achieving 100% of the targets and approximately 125% of the non-performance related emoluments for achieving the maximum targets. Due to its even stronger weighting, the LTI bonus is approximately 87.5% for achieving 100% of the targets and approximately 262.5% of the non-performance related emoluments for achieving the maximum targets.\n\nIn principle, this remuneration covers all activities for the Company and for those activities with the Company under Sections 15 et seqq. German Stock Corporation Ac[t. GRI 2-21](#page-286-0)\n\n#### Non-performance related emoluments\n\nThe members of Instone Real Estate Group SE's Management Board receive non-performance-related emoluments in the form of a fixed base annual salary (base remuneration) and fringe benefits. The fixed annual base salary is paid in twelve equal instalments at the end of a month, and for the last time for the full month in which the Management Board employment contract ends.\n\nThe members of the Management Board also receive non-performancerelated fringe benefits. These include, for example, the use of a company car and the payment of premiums for accident insurance with payments at a standard market level and are taken into consideration in the maximum remuneration of the Management Board.\n\n#### Performance-based emoluments\n\nThe performance-based remuneration components consist of a variable remuneration element with a (one-year) short-term incentive [STI] and a variable remuneration element with a multi-year assessment basis (longterm incentive [LTI]). Due to the design of the components, the share of the LTI outweighs the share of the STI in the target remuneration.\n\nIf the Management Board member is not entitled to remuneration for the entire financial year underlying the calculation, a corresponding pro rata reduction of this variable remuneration component is made.\n\n{270}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n#### **[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nOne-Year Variable Remuneration – Short-Term Incentive (STI)\n\nThe one-year variable remuneration in the form of the STI is linked to\n\n→ the financial result or performance of the Instone Group in the underlying financial year (financial targets) and\n\n→ the strategy and sustainability goals defined for the individual members of the Management Board.\n\n| Financial year 0          | Financial year 1                    |            | Financial year 2                       |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| STI bonus base amount (€) | Performance period                  |            | Payment (€)                            |\n|                           | Targets:                            | Weighting: |                                        |\n|                           | Financial targets:                  | 75%        |                                        |\n|                           | EAT (adjusted)                      | 37.5%      |                                        |\n|                           | Volume of sales contracts           | 37.5%      |                                        |\n|                           | Strategy and sustainability targets | 25%        | Cap: 200% of the STI bonus base amount |\n\nThe financial targets set out in the STI, which account for a total of 75% of the STI bonus base amount, are made up of earnings after tax (EAT [adjusted]) and the volume of sales contracts, both being weighted identically with 37.5% each. Both the EAT (adjusted) and the volume of sales contracts are key operating financial and management key figures and performance indicators of the Instone Group and are part of the company's forecast. Both financial targets are therefore decisive for the corporate strategy of the Management Board and the long-term development of the Instone Group. In the view of the Supervisory Board, the measurement of short-term variable remuneration on the basis of these key operating financial and management indicators and performance indicators seems appropriate in order to ensure that the Management Board is incentivised to implement the corporate strategy. The EAT (adjusted) result-based key figure is also the benchmark for the dividend policy. The real estate business key performance indicators of the volume\n\nof sales contracts includes all sales-related transactions, such as notarised real estate purchase agreements, individual orders from customers and rental income. Both financial targets are derived from the corporate planning prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board and the forecast, and are set uniformly for the Management Board for each bonus year. The EAT (adjusted) and the volume of sales contracts are determined on the basis of the adjusted results of operations on which the financial reporting of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based and which is explained in more detail in the management report o[n page 133 et seqq..](#page-132-0)\n\nThe linking of the one-year variable remuneration with these key financial and management key figures of the Instone Group serves to ensure profitable and sustainable growth. In addition, the selection of these targets provides incentives for the Management Board to act in accordance with the corporate strategy and the planning approved by the Supervisory Board or to exceed the forecast communicated to the capital market in the best case scenario.\n\n**The strategy and sustainability targets** relevant for the relevant bonus year are set individually by the Supervisory Board for each bonus year and for each member of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board usually sets two to four targets for each member of the Management Board which serve to implement corporate strategy and long-term corporate development. The strategy and sustainability targets are included in the STI bonus at 25%. This gives the Supervisory Board the opportunity to define central, not necessarily financial targets for the Management Board in the company's interest and to link them to the personal performance of the Management Board members. These targets may include environmental concerns such as CO2 reduction, customer and employee satisfaction, the value of investor sales or the improvement of corporate financing as well as the promotion and development of the new nyoo product line (affordable housing) or the construction of subsidised housing. To ensure sufficient transparency and traceability of the achievement of objectives, the Supervisory Board ensures that targets are set or criteria defined for the targets, the achievement of which can ideally be determined and measured using quantitative methods. The Supervisory Board can weigh the annual strategy and sustainability targets differently, whereby each individual target must be weighted with a minimum of at least 25% within the strategy and sustainability targets.\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nAn STI bonus base amount in euros is agreed for each member of the Management Board in their contract of employment. The payment amount of this variable compensation component is set depending on the achievement of the targets for which the Supervisory Board sets the target or threshold values to be achieved for each performance period, then as follows:\n\n- → At the end of the relevant bonus year (performance period), the Supervisory Board defines the target achievement for each individual target and converts the target achievement into an overall target achievement, taking into account the weighting of all the individual targets. The maximum target achievement for each individual STI target is capped at 175%.\n- → The overall target achievement is assigned to an STI payout factor using the bonus curve shown in figure 026. If the overall target achievement falls below 75% **(lower target limit)**, there is no entitlement to a payment of the STI bonus. Due to the ambitious target setting, above-average performance by the members of the Management Board is disproportionately rewarded: If the overall target achievement is 150% or more **(target cap)**, the STI payout factor is 200%. The STI payout factor for an overall target achievement of between 100% and 150% is calculated on a proportional basis If the overall target achievement is between 75% and 100%, the STI payout factor corresponds to the overall target achievement on a linear basis.\n- → The STI payout factor is multiplied by the agreed STI bonus base amount and thus results in the payout amount of the STI bonus in euros for the performance period. The payout amount may reach a maximum of 200% of the STI bonus base amount **(cap)**. The payment is made in the month following approval of the audited annual financial statements of the Company.\n\nBelow is an example of the overall goal achievement at STI and the resulting STI payout factor:\n\nImage /page/271/Figure/15 description: The image shows a bonus curve for overall target achievement. The x-axis represents the overall target achievement, and the y-axis represents the payment factor. The curve starts at 0% payment factor for less than 75% overall target achievement. At 75% overall target achievement, the payment factor is approximately 75%. At 100% overall target achievement, the payment factor is 100%. An overall target achievement of 150% or more leads to the maximum payment factor of 200%.\n\n#### Multi-Year Variable Remuneration (Long-Term Incentive (LTI))\n\nAnother component of variable remuneration is that the members of the Management Board are also promised multi-year variable compensation in the form of an LTI bonus on the basis of a share-based virtual performance share plan. By linking the share price of Instone Group shares, incentives are provided for the Management Board to promote the long-term and sustainable development of the Instone Group. In addition, the interests of shareholders and the Management Board are strengthened.\n\nImage /page/271/Figure/18 description: This image shows a diagram of variable compensation - LTI. The diagram includes the following elements: Financial year 0, Financial year 1, Financial year 2, Financial year 3, Financial year 4, STI bonus base amount (€), Share price for the last three months of financial year 3, Share price of the last three months of financial year 0, Provisional virtual share tranche (base number), Share price performance, Performance period, LTI bonus payment factor 0-300%, Cap: 300%, Targets, Weighting, Financial targets: 70%, Relative TSR vs SDAX 20%, Earnings per share 50%, ESG target 30%, Final virtual share tranche, Sum total of hypothetically reinvested distributions, Payment amount in €, Cap: 300% of the LTI bonus base amount.\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nThe amount of any LTI bonus depends on\n\n- → The amount of the LTI bonus base amount and the average share price used as a basis at the time of the allocation of the virtual share tranche in financial year 0, in other words the financial year before the start of the three-year performance period,\n- → Achieving financial and non-financial ESG targets during a three-year performance period and\n- → The share price performance (taking into account dividends) of Instone Real Estate Group SE during the three-year performance period.\n\nThe assessment period for the multi-year variable remuneration is therefore a total of three years.\n\nThe financial targets set out in the LTI are the development of the adjusted earnings per share **(EPS)** and the total shareholder return (share price performance taking into account dividends) of Instone Real Estate Group SE compared to the SDAX **(relative TSR)** representing a total of 70% of the LTI bonus base amount and weighted at 50% and 20% respectively. Both financial targets are derived from the corporate planning prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board and the forecast, and are set uniformly for the Management Board for each threeyear performance period.\n\nThe **EPS target** sets a target by which the Management Board is incentivised to increase the long-term profitability of the company on the basis of the multi-year performance period. This creates an incentive to manage the company for profit while at the same time generating sustainable growth in the long-term in the interest of the shareholders. The EPS target is set in the form of an aggregated target value over the performance period. The EPS target is calculated on the basis of the adjusted results of operations on which the financial reporting of Instone Real Estate Group SE is based and which is explained in more detail in the management report on page [133 et seqq..](#page-132-0)\n\nThe **relative TSR** provides an incentive for the Management Board to deliver above-average performance compared to other listed companies. The development of the share price also reflects the increase in the value of the company from the shareholder's point of view. The Supervisory Board\n\nconsiders the SDAX, which consists of companies of a comparable size and in which the Instone Group share was listed until the end of the last financial year, to be an appropriate benchmark. However, since the Instone Group share is currently no longer listed in the SDAX or in the event that the SDAX is subject to significant changes or that other developments occur that no longer make a reference to the SDAX appear appropriate, the Supervisory Board may also choose another suitable share index as a reference value for the remuneration system.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also sets a non-financial **ESG** (Environmental, Social and Governance) target, which accounts for 30% of the LTI bonus base amount. The ESG target, which is set uniformly for each annual LTI tranche granted to all members of the Management Board, is intended to encourage the sustainable development of the Instone Group in accordance with the Company's ESG strategy. The Supervisory Board will define a target that is in line with the interests of the company's stakeholders and is geared toward achieving a long-term, three-year target. The measurement of the target achievement is ideally designed to be quantifiable.\n\nAn LTI bonus base amount in euros is agreed for each member of the Management Board in their contract of employment. This is divided by the average volume-weighted Instone Group share price of the last three months of the financial year before the start of the performance period to determine a provisional tranche of virtual shares allocated to the relevant Management Board member **(base number)**. The payment amount of this variable compensation component is set depending on the achievement of the targets for which the Supervisory Board sets the target or threshold values to be achieved for each performance period and the share price performance of Instone Group shares, then as follows:\n\n- → At the end of the three-year performance period, the Supervisory Board decides the achievement of targets for each individual target.\n- → The target achievement for each individual target is assigned to an LTI payout factor using the bonus curve shown in figure 029. Taking into account the relevant weighting of the individ[ual target, a](#page-273-0) total payout factor is formed from the individual LTI payout factors defined in this way. Due to the ambitious target setting, above-average performance by the members of the Management Board is disproportionately rewarded: If the target achievement is 150% or more for an individual target **(upper target limit)**, the relevant LTI payout factor for this\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-273-0\"></span>**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n#### **[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nindividual target is 300%. The LTI payout factor for a target achievement of between 100% and 150% is calculated on a proportional basis If the target achievement for an individual target is 100% or less, the LTI payout factor corresponds to the relevant target achievement (subject to and up to a **lower target limit** defined by the Supervisory Board ).\n\n→ To determine the relative TSR, the final price of the Instone Group share is compared to the initial price. For the purpose of smoothing out the initial and final price, the volume-weighted average of the closing prices of the Instone Group share in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the previous three months is used to determine the initial and final price, including dividend payments, are also used for the final price. assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period. For the calculation of the development of the SDAX (as a performance index), the initial value is the arithmetic mean of the closing balances in the SDAX of the last three months before the beginning of the performance period and the final value is the arithmetic mean of the closing balances of the SDAX over the last three months of the relevant three-year performance period. The target achievement for the relative TSR and the pro rata LTI payout factor is 100% if, at the end of the performance period, the development of the share price (including dividend payments, assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period) of the Instone Group share corresponds to the development of the SDAX. If the target achievement for the relative TSR is less than 75%, this target is considered to have been missed and it is shown in figure 028.\n\n→ The base number of virtual shares is multiplied by the total payout factor and the average volume-weighted share price of the last three months prior to the end of the last financial year of the performance period, taking into account dividend payments, assuming reinvestment in Instone Group shares during the performance period (total shareholder return approach), in order to equate the Management Board with a real shareholder. The payment is made after the end of the performance. in the month following approval of the audited annual financial statements of the Company.\n\nThe following is an example of the bonus curves for the relative TSR target (see figure above) and for calculating the additional LTI payout factors (EPS target and ESG target) (see figure below):\n\nImage /page/273/Figure/13 description: This image shows a bonus curve for relative TSR (Total Shareholder Return). The x-axis represents target achievement, and the y-axis represents the payout factor. The curve starts at 0% payout for target achievement less than 75%. At 75% target achievement (Outperformance -25%), the payout factor jumps to 75%. The payout factor increases linearly from 75% to 300% as the target achievement increases from 75% to 150% (Outperformance 50%). A target achievement rate of 150% or more results in the maximum payout factor of 300%.\n\nImage /page/273/Figure/14 description: The image shows a bonus curve for LTI payout factors. The y-axis is labeled \"Payment factor\" and ranges from 0% to 300%. The x-axis is labeled \"Target achievement\" and ranges from 0% to 150% (cap). A dashed line represents the \"Target lower limits to be specified by AR\". The solid line starts at 0%, increases to 100% at 100% target achievement, and then increases to 300% at 150% target achievement. The image also contains the text \"Bonus curve - LTI payout factors\" and \"FIGURE 029\".\n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIn the event of an extraordinary development in the share price, the Supervisory Board is entitled to take into account a reasonable longer period before the end of the relevant bonus year for calculating the average closing price. If capital measures lead to a reduction or increase in the number of Instone Group shares (for example, share splits or share consolidation), this effect is taken into account by means of suitable calculations when determining the target achievement and its effect is neutralised.\n\nThe payout amount of the LTI bonus is capped at an amount corresponding to 300% of the LTI bonus base amount (LTI cap).\n\n#### Share Ownership Guideline\n\nTo strengthen the long-term development and encourage the investment of the Management Board in Instone Real Estate Group SE, the members of the Management Board are obliged by a Share Ownership Guideline to complete a four-year development phase by acquiring shares in Instone Real Estate Group SE in the amount of a gross annual salary that is independent of their performance and holding them for the entire term of their Management Board contract, starting with their appointment to the Management Board. The equivalent value is based on the purchase price of the shares. The shares already held by a member of the Management Board are added to this figure.\n\nIf the relevant Management Board member has acquired shares in the amount of a gross annual salary not dependent on performance, the ownership level must not fall below this threshold by up to 50% for a maximum period of six months.\n\nIn this case, the Management Board member is obliged to add to the number of shares held within a period of six months up to the amount of a gross annual salary that is not dependent on performance.\n\n### **E. Definition of Maximum Remuneration and Temporary Deviations from the Remuneration System**\n\n#### Maximum remuneration\n\nUnder Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board has set a maximum amount for the total of all remuneration components, including fringe benefits and pension commitments. This amounts to €3.1 million for the Chairman of the\n\nManagement Board (CEO) and €2.35 million for the other members of the Management Board. The maximum remuneration defined by the Supervisory Board takes into account the findings of the peer group analysis as well as the strongly performance and growth-focused structure of the Management Board remuneration system and is intended to enable the market-based and company-specific development of the Management Board remuneration in the interest of the company.\n\n#### Temporary Deviations from the Remuneration System\n\nA deviation from the remuneration system is possible on an exceptional basis for the Supervisory Board under the legal provision of Section 87a (2) sentence 2 AktG if exceptional circumstances make a deviation necessary in the interest of the long-term well-being of the company. This requires a Supervisory Board resolution that establishes the need for a deviation in a transparent and justified manner. The components of the remuneration system specifically affected by the deviation and the necessity of the deviation must also be explained to the shareholders in the remuneration report. A deviation may be made if the described requirements are satisfied, in particular from the performance criteria of the variable remuneration, the ratio of the components of the target remuneration and for exceptional fringe benefits.\n\n### **F. Opportunities for the Company to Reclaim Variable Remuneration Components**\n\nThe contracts of employment of Management Board members contain provisions that give the Supervisory Board discretion to retain (malus) or recover (clawback) part or all of the variable remuneration components. The requirement for the application of these regulations is grossly negligent and serious violation of statutory or contractual duties or the Company's internal codes of conduct. In such cases, the Supervisory Board may, at its reasonable discretion, reduce and retain variable remuneration components that have not yet been paid out or demand repayment of variable remuneration components that have already been paid out.\n\nThe aforementioned claims shall lapse two years after the end of the assessment period of the relevant variable remuneration component.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n#### **Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n**[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### **G. Remuneration-Related Legal Transactions**\n\nTerms and conditions for the termination of remuneration-related legal transactions\n\nThe term of the Management Board contracts runs in parallel with the term of appointment of the Management Board member as decided by the Supervisory Board. Each contract of employment has a fixed term and therefore does not contain an ordinary right of termination. The right to extraordinary termination is unaffected.\n\n#### Compensation for Dismissal\n\nIf the employment contract of a member of the Management Board is terminated extraordinarily by the Company for good cause before the end of the term of the LTI bonus (so-called \"bad leaver case\"), this will result in the expiry of all rights arising from the LTI bonus which is attributable to a period before the expiry of the respective term of three years.\n\nIf the contract of employment of a Management Board member ends before the end of the term of the LTI bonus and the other requirements for a \"bad leaver case\" do not exist at the same time (so-called \"good leaver case\"), the entitlement to the LTI bonus from performance periods that are already ongoing and, if applicable, pro rata for the upcoming performance period will remain in force.\n\nSpecial termination rights were agreed with the members of the Management Board in the event of a change of control. The members of the Management Board are entitled to a severance payment if, in addition to a change of control, the basis on which they can run the business suffers a significant adverse effect, in other words if the Management Board member loses their position, the Company is merged, all or a significant portion of the Company's assets are transferred to third party legal entities that do not belong to the Instone Group, a control and/or profit transfer agreement is concluded with the Company as a dependent company, the legal form of the Company is changed and the Management Board member thereby loses the independence granted by the German Stock Corporation Act or the SE-VO or if the decision-making powers of the terminating Management Board member suffer significant adverse effect for no material reason. Under the employment contract of a Management Board member, the conclusion of a control and/or profit transfer agreement with the Company as obligated parties does not qualify as a significant adverse effect in the running of the business under certain conditions. In addition, the members of the Management Board have special termination rights in the event of\n\ndismissal due to a loss of confidence at the Annual General Meeting or resignation from office for a material reason.\n\nIn the event that a special right of termination is exercised, the terminating member of the Management Board is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of 1.5 gross annual remuneration, whereby this severance payment is reduced pro rata temporis if the remaining term of the employment contract that is less than 1.5 years. No severance claim exists if the appointment ends due to dismissal for a material reason within the meaning of Section 626 BGB or due to good cause within the meaning of Section 84 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which is not based on the loss of confidence at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nVariable remuneration components shall also be paid out in the event of premature termination of activities on the Management Board on the basis of the assessment bases originally agreed (performance targets, performance periods etc.) and due dates.\n\n#### Pension commitments\n\nTwo members of the Management Board still have a company pension plan in the form of individual contractual pension agreements which are valid after reaching the minimum pensionable age of 65 years. These two pension agreements were agreed well before the IPO or the appointment of the members entitled to benefits to the Management Board in 2008 and 1987 and will continue to be implemented.\n\nThe two members of the Management Board entitled to the pension provision are credited with the pension component for the duration of the pension commitment as part of this company pension provision model in accordance with the pension agreements with them which form the basis. This will be credited from the time they reach the age of 65 with a specific monthly payment amount, and will cumulatively reflect the respective pension entitlement under the company pension scheme. The respective amount of the monthly pension component is calculated on the basis of the monthly non-performance-related cash remuneration of the members of the Management Board entitled to the benefit, multiplied by an age factor, which maps an appropriate interest rate, and another fixed amount to be determined annually.

Remuneration of Management Board members in the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe following part of the remuneration report provides details of the specific application of the remuneration system to the members of the Management Board and the remuneration of the individual members of the Management Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2022 financial year was approved by the Annual General Meeting of Instone Real Estate Group SE on 14 June 2023 by more than 92% of the votes cast, so there was no reason to change the remuneration system, to question its implementation or the way in which the remuneration of the Management Board and Supervisory Board is reported.\n\n#### Total remuneration\n\nThe total remuneration granted and owed to the current members of the Management Board for the 2023 financial year within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG amounted to a total of €2,190 thousand. Under the explanatory memorandum to Section 162 (1) AktG, the amounts due during the reporting period and already received by the individual member of the Management Board or whose due payment has not yet been made must be stated as the remuneration granted and owed (inflows). The following table shows the total remuneration under these principles, broken down by remuneration components and individually for the current members of the Management Board for the 2023 financial year and the previous year.\n\n#### **Remuneration under Section 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG TABLE 110**\n\nIn thousands of euros\n\n|                                           | Kruno Crepulja |       |       | Dr. Foruhar<br>Madjlessi3 |       | David Dreyfus4 |       | Andreas Gräf |      |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------|---------------------------|-------|----------------|-------|--------------|------|\n|                                           | CEO            | 2022  |       | CFO                       | 2022  | CFO            | 2022  | COO          | 2022 |\n|                                           | 2023           |       | 2023  |                           | 2023  |                | 2023  |              |      |\n| Non-performance<br>related emoluments     | 526            | 525   | 283   | 437                       | 148   | 0              | 406   | 406          |      |\n| One-off<br>cushion bonus1                 | 0              | 0     | 0     | 0                         | 300   | 0              | 0     | 0            |      |\n| Fringe benefits2                          | 30             | 29    | 4     | 5                         | 3     | 0              | 15    | 15           |      |\n| Short-term variable<br>remuneration (STI) | 0              | 351   | 0     | 316                       | 0     | 0              | 0     | 309          |      |\n| Long-term variable<br>remuneration (LTI)  | 195            | 446   | 163   | 0                         | 0     | 0              | 117   | 268          |      |\n| Total                                     | 751            | 1,351 | 450   | 758                       | 451   | 0              | 538   | 998          |      |\n| Maximum<br>remuneration                   | 3,100          | 3,100 | 2,350 | 2,350                     | 2,145 | 0              | 2,350 | 2,350        |      |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The one-off cushion bonus is the results of Mr Dreyfus taking up his position on the Management Board and is in compliance with the remuneration system.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Excluding pension costs.

The LTI bonus base amount shown reflects this pro rata temporis.\n\n#### LTI tranches granted\n\nThe LTI tranches granted as of 31 December 2023 are shown in the table below, broken down by individual members of the Management Board.\n\nThe LTI tranches have a term of three years and are only paid out at the end of the relevant term at the average closing prices of the Instone Group share determined at that time.\n\nIn the case of the LTI tranches referred to as \"(old)\", which were still granted under the remuneration system until 30 June 2021, the basic number of virtual shares granted is multiplied by the average closing price of the Instone Group share during the last 20 trading days of the relevant term, plus any dividend paid. The payout amount calculated in this way is capped for each virtual share in the LTI tranches (old) at the amount that corresponds to 200% of the initial value determined for the relevant bonus year. For the determination of the LTI initial value at the time the LTI tranches were granted, a planned/actual comparison was made of the adjusted earnings before tax for the bonus year as well as the two previous years and virtual shares were allocated at the average price during the last 20 trading days before the end of the bonus year. During the term of the LTI tranches (old), no performance criteria are applied, so the final payout amount is therefore exclusively dependent on the share price performance of Instone Group shares.\n\nFor the LTI tranches referred to as (new), the payment is made using the outline parameters described i[n I.

The average remuneration for this comparison group was calculated on the basis of remuneration paid, taking into account the employment rate.\n\n#### **Vertical comparison TABLE 119**\n\nChanges in %\n\n| Comparison period                                                                                                | 2019 vs.<br>20181 | 2020 vs.<br>2019 | 2021 vs.<br>2020 | 2022 vs.<br>2021 | 2023 vs<br>2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Management Board members                                                                                         |                   |                  |                  |                  |                 |\n| Kruno Crepulja                                                                                                   | 35                | 0                | -14              | 89               | -44             |\n| Dr. Foruhar Madjlessi2                                                                                           | –                 | 115              | -23              | 21               | -41             |\n| David Dreyfus3                                                                                                   | –                 | –                | –                | –                | –               |\n| Andres Gräf                                                                                                      | 57                | 0                | -11              | 63               | -46             |\n| Supervisory Board members                                                                                        |                   |                  |                  |                  |                 |\n| Stefan Brendgen                                                                                                  | -1                | 0                | 10               | 18               | 2               |\n| Dr Jochen Scharpe                                                                                                | 14                | 1                | 10               | 14               | -2              |\n| Marija Korsch4                                                                                                   | 9                 | -8               | 5                | –                | –               |\n| Dietmar P.

In accordance with Section 162 (3) AktG, we have not audited the content of the remuneration report.\n\nIn our opinion, the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made, in all material respects, in the accompanying remuneration report. Our audit opinion does not cover the content of the remuneration report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 (3) AktG and in compliance with the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Remuneration Report pursuant to Section 162 (3) AktG (IDW AuS 870 (09.2023)). Our responsibilities under those requirements and this standard are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities\" section of our report. Our audit firm has applied the IDW Quality Management Standards. We have fulfilled our professional responsibilities in accordance with the German Public Auditor Act (WPO) and the Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP) including the requirements on independence.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe executive board and the supervisory board are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of Section 162 AktG. In addition, they are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including their related disclosures, that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities**\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made, in all material respects, in the remuneration report, and to express an opinion on this in a report on the audit.\n\nWe planned and conducted our audit in such a way to be able to determine whether the remuneration report is formally complete by comparing the disclosures made in the remuneration report with the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG. In accordance with Section 162 (3) AktG, we have neither audited the correctness of the content of the disclosures, nor the completeness of the content of the individual disclosures, nor the adequate presentation of the remuneration report.\n\nDusseldorf/Germany, 11 March 2024\n\n#### **Deloitte GmbH**\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSigned: Rolf Künemann Signed: Nicole Meyer Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüferin (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor)\n\nSigned: Nicole Meyer\nWirtschaftsprüferin\n(German Public Auditor)\n\n{285}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-285-0\"></span>**[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n**[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n **Other information**\n\n### **Assurance of legal representatives**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we declare that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the results of operations, net assets and financial position of the Group in accordance with the applicable accounting principles and that the management report of the Group, which is combined with the Company's management report, includes a true and fair view of the development, performance and results of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.\n\nEssen, 8 March 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nS.

The Instone Group site at Erlangen is also classed as a core city (Nuremberg) as a result of its size and proximity to Nuremberg.\n\n#### Anticipated items\n\nDeferred items in the balance sheet that reflect that expenses or income incurred during the year under review do not result in income or expenditure until the following year.\n\n#### Realignment of boundaries (boundary areas)\n\nWhen realigning boundaries, scattered plots are grouped into a larger plot and surrounding plots are assigned to a central plot to increase the usability of the land.\n\n#### Asset deal\n\nIn an asset deal, the assets held in a company or just a single asset are purchased and the individual assets are transferred.\n\n#### B and C cities/add cities\n\nB cities: Major cities of national and regional importance.\n\nC cities: key German cities of regional and, to a limited extent, national importance that significantly impact the surrounding regions.\n\nThe Instone Group uses the generic term \"add cities\" for these attractive cities.\n\n#### Brownfield developments\n\nProject developments on former industrial sites and conversion areas that have been reclassified for residential utilisation and therefore do not require additional sealed surfaces. On the contrary, existing areas are upgraded or improved.\n\n#### Contractual trust arrangement (CTA)\n\nPension trust company\n\n#### Deferred compensation\n\nDeferred compensation; pension commitment within the company pension scheme – financed by a waiver of the employee's remuneration.\n\n#### Divestment\n\nRelease of restricted capital in longer-term assets by selling them.\n\n#### Duration\n\nTerm of commitment of the capital invested in fixed-income securities.\n\n#### EBIT\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes.\n\n#### EBITDA\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.\n\n{293}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\nIndividual sale\n\nIn an individual sale, an owner-occupied apartment only changes owners once after completion, when it is sold by the Instone Group directly to the client. Individual sales are managed either by commissioned sales agents or by the Instone Group.\n\n### Equity method\n\nAccounting method for the long-term investments of a company that participates in the voting capital of another company (the investment book value is constantly adjusted to the development of the equity of the company in which the investment has been made).\n\n#### EURIBOR\n\nAbbreviation for the reference interest rate Euro Interbank Offered Rate.\n\n#### Family offices\n\nCompanies or departments of banks managing large private assets.\n\n#### Zoning and development planning processes\n\nAccording to Section 1 (2) of the German Building Code (BauGB), a zoning plan is a preparatory urban land-use plan for part of a city, and is governed by Sections 5 et seq. BauGB. It regulates the available and probable space requirements for the individual utilisation options, such as housing, work, leisure and traffic. A development plan is a binding urban land-use plan. A development plan regulates how and what may be built on plots of land and the resulting utilisation of the areas to be left free of buildings.\n\n### FTE\n\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) is a key indicator used in staff planning. One FTE is equivalent to the time worked by one full-time employee. The standard used to convert an FTE into working hours is the average number of working hours per work day.\n\n#### Subsidised residential space\n\nHomes for rent that have been created or modernised with the provision of subsidies from state budgets or development banks and whose occupancy and rent levels have been regulated for a certain period of time (social commitment).\n\n#### Greenfield developments\n\nProject development on a previously undeveloped, non-built-up area, in other words on a \"green field\".\n\n#### GRI\n\nGRI standards constitute global best practice for public disclosures about various economic, environmental and social impacts. The modular, interlinked GRI standards are intended to be primarily used as a template for compiling a sustainability report focusing on material topics. The three universal standards are used by any organisation that publishes a sustainability report.\n\n#### IFRS 15\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\".\n\nIFRS 15 regulates when and the extent to which a company reporting in accordance with IFRS must recognise revenue. Companies preparing the financial statements are also required to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard offers a single, principle-based, five-step model that can be applied to all contracts with customers.\n\n#### IFRS 16\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 \"Leases\".\n\nIFRS 16 governs the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for leases in financial statements for companies reporting in line with IFRS. The lessee uses a single accounting model according to which all assets and liabilities arising from leases (with a few exceptions) are reported in the statement of financial position. The lessor continues to distinguish between finance and operating leases for accounting purposes.\n\n### ICS\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) is a system of technical and organisational rules for methodological management and controls in the company and is designed to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent losses.\n\n{294}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[Our company](#page-1-0)**\n\n### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\n#### **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n#### Investor development\n\nProject developments for the stock owned by an investor or developments at the risk and on behalf of third parties.\n\nInvestor sales\n\nProjects are sold to investors by Instone Group key account holders.\n\n#### Capital market sales\n\nForm of selling characterised by a multi-level agency organisation.

The analyses are based on several elements, including the calculation rules in the context of buildings under DIN 15978 as also applied or to be applied by the DGNB and QNG. The choice of the life cycle models under DIN 15978 includes the manufacturing phase (A1-3), exchange during use (B4), energy consumption during use (B6) and waste management and disposal (C3 and C4).\n\n#### MaBV\n\nThe German Broker and Property Developer Regulation (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung, MaBV) is a legal regulation derived from the German Trade Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung) which, in German trade law, primarily provides specifications for the protection of the real estate purchaser when drafting and concluding a property development contract.\n\n#### Mezzanine financing\n\nFinancing with hybrid capital, which includes both equity and debt financing.\n\n#### New work\n\nNew work today means roughly the same as the work of the future. The term new work covers all developments that are significant in terms of a modern, employee-oriented working environment in the 21st century.\n\n#### Prosperous medium-sized cities\n\nThese cities include the following for the Instone Group: Darmstadt, Dresden, Freiburg im Breisgau, Hanover, Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Karlsruhe, Mainz, Mannheim, Potsdam, Ulm and Wiesbaden.\n\n### PoC method\n\nPercentage-of-completion method.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nPurpose is an important term in the corporate world. It refers to the raison d'etre of a company. It is the motivation that is deeply embedded in the company and has long-term relevance.\n\n### Neighbourhood development\n\nThe neighbourhood is defined by infrastructure, such as public spaces; residential, service, local amenity and transport buildings; educational, sport, cultural and medical facilities; and green spaces, roads, railways and paths.\n\nThe neighbourhood influences and determines emotional factors such as identification, communities, participation processes, sense of security, pedestrian access, building culture and membership of clubs.\n\nThe neighbourhood can both create and impair quality of life, opportunities, prospects and engagement, as well as social and economic participation and variety of tenants in terms of income and background – in an urban environment at least.\n\n{295}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **[To our shareholders](#page-18-0)**\n\n**Combined [management report](#page-34-0)**\n\n**[Consolidated financial](#page-198-0)  statements**\n\n**Independent [auditor's report](#page-256-0)**\n\n### Scope 2 emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions\n\nfleet and internal production.\n\nROCE\n\nScope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased energy for internal use.\n\nScope 1 covers direct emissions from company assets, the company car\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE) is an indicator which measures how efficiently and profitably a company employs the capital it uses. The\n\nInstone Group calculates ROCE as follows:\n\nROCE = EBIT/(two-year average equity + net debt)\n\n### Scope 3 emissions\n\n **[Other information](#page-285-0)**\n\n**[Remuneration report](#page-266-0)**\n\nScope 3 covers all other (not scope 2) indirect emissions, such as emissions from purchased products and services, but also emissions from employees commuting, business travel, the transportation of products and recycling.\n\n#### Share deal\n\nIn a share deal, purchasers acquire a company by buying all or almost all of the shares of a partnership or corporation.\n\n#### Instone Group social impact\n\nCreation of positive (social) added value in our building and neighbourhood developments.\n\n#### Rate per thousand people\n\nReportable accidents at work per 1000 full-time workers.\n\n#### Trading development\n\nThe project development process takes place at the own expense of the project developer. The marketing risk is borne by the project developer itself.\n\n#### WACC\n\nWeighted average cost of capital. The average is calculated from the cost of equity and the cost of debt and weighted with their share of total capital.\n\n#### Target areas\n\nIn addition to the core cities, the Instone Group's target areas also include prosperous medium-sized cities such as: Aachen, Augsburg, Baden-Baden, Erfurt, Ingolstadt, Halle, Kiel, Nuremberg, Regensburg and the Rhine-Main region.\n\n{296}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Quarterly comparison TABLE 120**\n\n| To our shareholders    | In millions of euros                             |          | Q4
