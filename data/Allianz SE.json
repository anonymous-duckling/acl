Notwithstanding this overall responsibility, the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.\n\nDivisional responsibilities for business segments and/or functional responsibilities are assigned to the individual departments. The latter include Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Mergers & Acquisitions. Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities in more detail.\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer t[o Mandates of the Members of the](#page-12-0)  [Board of Management.](#page-12-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare threeyear plans, which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. On the basis of this plan, the Supervisory Board sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remuneration structure, including target setting and performance assessment, please refer to th[e Remuneration Report.](#page-25-0)\n\nWe continuously monitor our business performance against these targets through monthly reviews – which cover key operational and financial metrics – to ensure we can move quickly and take <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group uses operating profit and core net income as key financial performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, core return on equity[1](#page-54-0) and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management. For a comprehensive overview of our business segment performance, please refer to the respective chapters on the following pages.\n\nBesides performance steering, we also have a risk-steering process in place, which is described in the [Risk and Opportunity](#page-129-0)  [Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) too, are taken into account when determining the variable remuneration of the Board of Management. Non-financial KPIs include customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction as well as various environmental indicators. For further information on non-financial KPIs, as well as an overview of the development and expected development of these non-financial KPIs, please refer to th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n# About the statement\n\nThis section has been compiled in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Directive Implementation Act (EU Directive 2014/95/EU), which has been transposed into German law via §§ 315d, 289f HGB.\n\nAllianz will be required to report under the new sustainability reporting regime of Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in its sustainability statement for financial year 2024. We are moving towards compliance with the CSRD with our financial year 2023 reporting for \"Climate change\" (European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) E1) and \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1), in terms of anticipating structural and many content requirements of CSRD. All material topics will be covered as per the CSRD as of financial year 2024 reporting. Going forward, the focus for Allianz will shift from reporting in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) towards full CSRD compliance for financial year 2024.\n\nThe topics \"Climate change\" and \"Own workforce\" are strategic sustainability focus areas at the Allianz Group, supported by our 2021 GRI materiality assessment and confirmed by the 2023 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) materiality assessment.\n\nThe concepts and key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect our material sustainability matters, based on the 2021 GRI materiality assessment, have been prepared in accordance with the latest GRI standards. For further information on our materiality assessment, please refer to section \"06.6\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThis non-financial chapter of our 2023 Annual Report covers the entire Allianz Group. All measures, activities, and key figures refer to the 2023 financial year (1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023). For targets relevant for the remuneration of the Board of Management, we disclose the targets that were set for this year, the achievements from this year and the targets for next year. For all other topics, we present the objectives and actions taken in the reporting year. Unless otherwise stated, we use the control principle defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when determining the scope of reporting for the Allianz Group. This Non-Financial Statement is an integral part of the management report and is subject to statutory audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.\n\nAny references to information published outside the Group Management Report and Allianz SE's Management Report are supplementary, do not form an integral part of this non-financial information, and are not subject to any assurance engagement (unless specified in the respective document).\n\nThe governance process for non-financial reporting is aligned with financial reporting and follows the same review principles as the Annual Report, engaging with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement has the following main chapters:\n\n- − Company description\n- − Corporate sustainability governance and strategy,\n- − Environmental matters,\n- − Social matters,\n- − Responsible consumer/sales,\n- − Cybersecurity,\n- − Human rights matters,\n- − Employee matters,\n- − Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters,\n- − EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- − Outlook.\n\n## <span id=\"page-55-1\"></span>Company description\n\nThe Allianz Group is one of the world's leading insurers and asset managers with around 125 million private and corporate customers[1](#page-55-1) in almost 70 countries.\n\nOur customers benefit from a broad range of personal and corporate insurance services. This includes property, life and health insurance, assistance services, credit insurance, and global business insurance.\n\nAs one of the world's largest investors, Allianz manages around € 737 bn on behalf of its insurance customers. Our asset managers – PIMCO and Allianz Global Investors – manage € 1.7 tn of third-party assets.\n\nFor further information on our business model, see our [Business](#page-52-0)  [Operations](#page-52-0) chapter in the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2023 and section \"01.2\" of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n# Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\n\nOur purpose – We secure your future – guides our actions across the Allianz Group and drives us to pursue constant innovation and collaboration. It also guides our interactions with our customers, partners, employees, investors, governments, regulators, society, people with disabilities and next generations across all our businesses.\n\nOur ambition is to support the transformation towards sustainable economies as a partner to our stakeholders. In doing so, we want to drive real-world impact across societies, economies, and the environment. This includes helping to shape the economy to provide the social minimum for all while maintaining environmental barriers.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are dedicated to responsible and transparent governance. Allianz has increased the importance of sustainability with the ambition to fully integrate sustainability across the company. Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. To support the Board of Management in its decision-making, Allianz SE established a dedicated Group Sustainability Board. It is composed of members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads, and meets quarterly. The core objectives of the Group Sustainability Board are: preparing the overall framework for sustainability for the Allianz Group, integrating sustainability into the Group's business processes with Allianz as an organization (operations and organization) and Allianz as a financial institution (investments, insurance, asset management), and maintaining oversight of and steering overarching sustainability matters.\n\nAllianz established a Sustainability Committee (as a committee of the Supervisory Board) to strengthen the integration and implementation of our sustainability strategy throughout the organization and business functions.\n\nThe core objectives of the Sustainability Committee include: advising the Supervisory Board on sustainability-related issues to support economically sound and sustainable development and positioning of the Allianz Group, closely monitoring and supporting oversight of the Management Board's sustainability strategy, in particular the management and execution of the strategic framework for group-wide sustainability measures and conducting preliminary examination of the sustainability-related disclosures, including the non-financial statement as part of the Supervisory Board's review. It also supports the Personnel Committee in the preparation of the sustainability-related target setting, as well as the review of the set targets' fulfillment for the Management Board's remuneration. In 2023, the Sustainability Committee prepared the recommendation of the sustainability-related targets for the members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE, reviewed the respective achievements of the Board of Management, and gave its recommendation to the Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Sustainability Committee was kept informed on the sustainability strategy and provided advice and guidance on critical issues.\n\nGlobal Sustainability was established in 2021 and supports the Group Sustainability Board in the execution of its responsibilities. This includes preparation, coordination, and implementation of the decisions by the Group Sustainability Board. It supports Allianz's Group Centers and operating entities to effectively integrate the Group's sustainability strategy into their business processes and policy framework. Global Sustainability drives the integration of sustainability-related matters across the organization and business to ensure Allianz plays a role in shaping the societies and economies in which it operates.\n\nGroup Centers take responsibility for sustainability within their functions with the purpose of embedding sustainability across the Allianz organization and business. Global Sustainability and Group Centers work with an extensive network of sustainability and business experts located across Allianz's operating entities, globally providing guidance and setting minimum standards to ensure they embed sustainability in their strategies and approaches. This network supports implementation of the group-wide sustainability strategy, shares best practice and scales positive impacts across the organization.\n\nOther Board of Management committees play an important role in decision-making processes:\n\n- − The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk.\n- − The Group Underwriting Committee monitors the underwriting business, its risk management and development of underwriting policies and strategies. This includes the integration of sustainability into these processes and strategies.\n- − The Group Investment Committee focuses on fundamental investment-related topics, including sustainability-related matters.\n\nWhile many operating entities (OEs) had already established local responsibilities for sustainability integration, this was formalized during 2023 with mandatory roles. Each OE must nominate one Board member to be responsible for sustainability, who will be supported by at least one Sustainability Lead.\n\nIn 2023 and for 2024, the targets for the Board of Management have been further developed to reflect sustainability priorities. The table below describes the targets in more detail. Minor wording changes were applied compared to the publications last year to create consistency with the Allianz SE Board Member target letters. The underlying targets remain unchanged compared to last year.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sustainability-related targets linked to the remuneration of the Board

To this end and to stay abreast of the trends that are most relevant to our stakeholders and our business, as well as to align our sustainability strategy, implementation measures, and reporting, we assess the materiality of sustainability matters on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2023, we carried out a robust and comprehensive double materiality assessment process (in accordance with the CSRD) and accompanying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)[1](#page-58-0), accounting for the evolving methodology to cover financial materiality (risks and opportunities from a business perspective) and impact materiality (impacts on people and planet). This has allowed us to deepen our understanding of matters previously identified as being material to our key stakeholders. It also enabled us to extend our assessment to those sustainability matters that have not been focus areas so far, but are now moving more into focus, as data, methodologies, and overall research and regulatory guidance evolve. The process, methodology, and outcome of the double materiality assessment were thoroughly reviewed and endorsed by our Group Sustainability Board and the Board of Management. In addition, Board of Management approval has been granted via the Allianz Group Annual Report sign-off process.\n\nThe CSRD double materiality assessment (CSRD DMA) will form the basis of our future reporting and will be reviewed annually. It has also been used to test our 2021 materiality assessment, which was based on the GRI Standards. This GRI materiality assessment, which identified 19 material issues, is still applicable. Topics were ranked and presented in a materiality matrix based on key stakeholder views on their importance to society and our business. The highest-ranked topics under the GRI materiality assessment were:\n\n- − Climate change,\n- − Ethics and responsible business,\n- − Cybersecurity.\n\nFor further details on the GRI materiality assessment, please refer to the \"06.6\" section in the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe CSRD DMA confirms the relevance of the previously identified topics. In addition, it forms the basis for introducing further topics to our sustainability reporting going forward, primarily from more broadly looking into impacts in the value chain. Regarding sustainability-related risks, the CSRD DMA does not identify additional principal risks with expected significant adverse impacts on Allianz (as according to the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). For further information on (potential) sustainability-related risks, please refer to the section \"Outlook\".\n\nWhile taxation is not covered under CSRD, it remains a relevant topic for Allianz in 2023 under the NFRD and is reported based on GRI 207-Tax. The respective information can be found in the section \"04.5\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)** as well as in our Group Tax Strategy published separately on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_TTR_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Partnerships also remain a relevant topic; going forward, respective details will be covered under the CSRD topic to which a partnership relates.\n\nThe topics \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) and \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1) are strategic sustainability focus areas at the Allianz Group, supported by the GRI materiality assessment and confirmed by the CSRD DMA. As such, we chose to already converge towards the CSRD with our financial year 2023 reporting for these two topics, in terms of anticipating its structural and many of its content requirements. For all material matters, disclosures in accordance with the topical ESRS and the cross-cutting ESRS will be fully covered as per the CSRD as of financial year 2024 reporting. As at financial year-end 2023, the stakeholder engagement process was still ongoing, so that reporting on this process and reflection of the results will be introduced next year.\n\nFor a description of the CSRD DMA process and outcome for the financial year 2023, please refer to the section \"Outlook\".\n\nOur purpose drives our sustainability priorities. This means supporting the transformation of economies that do not breach environmental barriers. It also means aspiring to achieve a social minimum for everyone. Building on our business strategy, we have set sustainability priorities that reflect our values and the areas where we think we can make an impact across Environment, Social, and Governance (E, S, and G).\n\nWe prioritize three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the integration of sustainability across Allianz and help us to contribute to societal, environmental, and economic change. In addition to SDG 13, Climate action, we have chosen SDG 8, Decent work and economic growth, to guide our work. We believe that delivering the sustainability agenda is only possible if stakeholders work together. This is why we also prioritize SDG 17, Partnership for the goals.\n\nEnvironment: our priority is Climate action/SDG 13. Our businesses spanning insurance, investment, and asset management are focused on understanding and shaping the climate transformation.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_It should be noted that the national transposition of the CSRD is still outstanding. The materiality assessment conducted for the financial year 2023 and described in this section and the Outlook section is based on the guidance from the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) available as\n\nat December 2023. In the event of changes to the CSRD upon becoming national law, those changes will be reflected in next year's reporting.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nSocial: our priority is Decent work and economic growth/SDG 8, including education upskilling and employability. We want to be a partner to our stakeholders, among them customers, governments, regulators, and societies. Our goal is to support the next generations and persons with disabilities so that they can access high-quality employment. Investing in learning and development for our diverse workforce is key to making all of this happen in a changing world of work.\n\nGovernance: our priority is to create trust through strong leadership. We aspire to be a trusted partner for protecting and growing our stakeholders' most valuable assets. Against that background, strong leadership is a key contributor to a company's culture and governance.\n\nIn everything we do across our priorities of E, S, and G, we strive to embed the sustainability principles and activities that are outlined in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nWe ground our strategy in proactive risk management to detect and address risks across the businesses. Group Risk is responsible for this process. We have not identified any remaining principal risks resulting from our operations, business activities, and business relations that could have severe adverse effects on material non-financial matters. Any potential risks and impacts identified throughout our risk assessment have been addressed by the respective concepts we have in place, which we describe in this report.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding sustainability issues allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities in underwriting, claims, proprietary investment management, and asset management. For further information on climate-related risks, please refer to the [Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0) Our concepts for all other matters for which reporting is required will be addressed in subsequent sections. The ESG approach provides part of the foundation for these concepts and is managed by Global Sustainability.\n\nWe continue to expand and strengthen our sustainability risk management framework. Understanding the requirements and limitations of our operating entities helps us to develop global sustainability processes that can be integrated into local processes and systems.\n\nOur commitment to tackling sustainability topics applies to our own operations and our insurance, investment, and asset management activities.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding and addressing sustainability issues helps us to reduce risks and capitalize on impacts and opportunities in all areas of our business.\n\nAs well as managing risks, sustainability integration directs us to create products and services that add value to society. We collaborate with clients and investee companies to deliver real-world benefits, and channel capital flows towards sustainable outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\n### **Sustainability opportunities and risks**\n\nAs an insurance company that manages risks ranging from single events to decades, it is important for Allianz to make a holistic assessment of risk.  \n\nIn the Allianz Group Risk Policy, we define sustainability risks as events or conditions that could have significant negative impacts on the assets, liabilities, profitability, or reputation of the Allianz Group or one of its companies. Examples include environmental and climate change risks, human rights violations, risks to local communities, and workforce risks.\n\nIf sustainability risks are not identified and managed effectively, they can have significant repercussions for Allianz and our customers, suppliers, investee companies and other stakeholders These repercussions include impacts on our reputation, supply chains, business continuity, quality, operations, and finances.  \n\nBy screening insurance, investment, and asset management projects from a sustainability perspective, we extend our understanding of risks and can exploit potential business opportunities to benefit shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders.  \n\n### **Our group-wide rules and processes**\n\nOur group-wide corporate rules and sustainability processes apply to all relevant underwriting, proprietary investment, and operations activities. They require strong collaboration between relevant functions and business areas.  \n\nKey processes are included in the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments. A new corporate rule, the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS), captures and updates some of the sustainability components of the AS RRIM in effect from 1 January 2024.  \n\nThe publicly available Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework provides transparency around our sustainability-related processes and guidelines. We published the fifth version of the Framework in 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**.\n\nOur asset management units have developed processes, rules, and governance for integrating sustainability into their investment activities.\n\nConsistent application of sustainability processes in our own business operations, insurance, and proprietary investment activities is crucial to mitigate risks and exploit the opportunities from the transition to a sustainable economy and society. It is also essential to our transformation into a sustainable financial service provider.\n\n### **Regulation as a driver of sustainability integration**\n\nWe welcome sustainability regulation as a major driver for fair competition and a level playing field.  We believe that sound regulation can improve the structure and clarity of sustainability information.\n\nIn 2023, we also actively engaged in and supported regulatory developments. For example, we are a member of the European Commission's Platform on Sustainable Finance and have contributed to the work of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) on EU sustainability reporting standards. Until April 2022, we did this via in-kind membership of the Project Task Force on European Sustainability Reporting Standards (PTF-ESRS). Since May 2022, when the new EFRAG governance was set up, our contribution has been via an in-kind membership representing the EU insurance industry in the Sustainability Reporting Technical Expert Group (SR TEG).\n\nIn this context, Allianz aims to contribute expert input with respect to the insurance industry, such as on the dual role of insurers as preparers and users of sustainability information, as well as on existing interconnected regulation.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe aim to leverage regulation on sustainability by ensuring consistent implementation across all Allianz businesses. At the same time, we aim to build business opportunities in line with regulatory concepts.\n\nAllianz has established a Sustainable Finance Regulation implementation project at Group level to drive this. Internal guidance is designed in close interaction with Group Centers and Operating Entities, to ensure consistent interpretation and implementation. The focus in 2023 was on the implementation of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), namely regarding pre-contractual and periodic product disclosure as well as website disclosure in consideration of \"Principal Adverse Impact\" for the Life-Asset product offering.\n\nIn 2023, Allianz started convergence into future CSRD reporting with a respective implementation project. The project is managed by the Group Accounting and Reporting function and defines policies, processes and reporting content in line with future ESRS requirements. The Group Sustainability Board oversees progress and deliverables of the project and provides directional guidance. The CSRD project is underpinned by the ambition to implement ESRS requirements with the same quality and diligence as for financial reporting processes.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nHuman-made climate change, one of the greatest global challenges of our time, has already caused far-reaching negative consequences and losses for nature and people. Various human and natural systems are being stressed beyond the limits of their adaptive capacity. Therefore, irreversible damage has already started to occur.\n\nIn order to mitigate these developments, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C by the end of the century. This has resulted in a fixed greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) budget; i.e., an upper limit for global emissions that may still be released. Based on modeled emission pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) **[6th](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)  [Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)**, emissions need to be almost halved every decade to restrict warming to 1.5 °C with limited or no overshoot, with a 50% probability of success. This would allow carbon (CO2) emissions to reach net-zero by 2050, meaning that residual emissions would be balanced by atmospheric carbon removal. Climate scientists estimate that halting GHG emissions on a net level would subsequently put a stop to further warming.\n\nIn 2022, however, annual energy-related carbon emissions reached a record level of 37 billion tons according to the **[International](https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-as-clean-energy-growth-offset-much-of-the-impact-of-greater-coal-and-oil-use)  [Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-as-clean-energy-growth-offset-much-of-the-impact-of-greater-coal-and-oil-use)**. If current trends continue, the GHG budget will be exceeded way before 2030 and the target of 1.5 °C will be overshot significantly. This increases the need for an even more rapid transition later on, as well as the use of atmospheric carbon removal – i.e., negative emission solutions – to bring warming back to 1.5 °C by the end of this century. **[Recent research](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach)** has shown this is still possible but requires urgent action by companies and policymakers alike.\n\nOur approach to climate change is grounded in the Allianz Group Climate Change Strategy. First published in 2005, it steers our response to climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities in our insurance and investment business. Since 2015, the Climate Change Strategy has been built around our efforts to anticipate climate risks, care for our customers, and enable the net-zero transition.\n\nSince 2018, our Climate Change Strategy has committed us to contribute to pursuing efforts that limit global warming to 1.5 °C by the end of thecentury. To anticipate and enable this transition, Allianz has committed to net-zero greenhouse gases (GHG) for our proprietary investments, Property-Casualty insurance, and our own operations. In September 2023, we published our Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Inaugural-Net-Zero-Transition-Plan.pdf)**, which describes our intermediary targets for 2030 and key actions to achieve them. This approach builds on the previously released 2025 emissions targets for proprietary investments and own operations.\n\nOur priorities include quantitative emission targets, strategic growth of financing and insuring of low-carbon technologies that support net-zero, targeted restrictions for fossil fuel-based business models to manage transition risks, and a systemic approach to investee engagement and policy advocacy, supported by climate action in our own operations.\n\nThese elements, which address the impacts, risks, and opportunities of climate change, are explained in more detail in the subsequent sections on insurance, investments, own operations, and risks. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition toward net-zero.\n\nSince the net-zero transition is a systemic issue, it requires a wholeof-society response. Therefore, we are also seeking to join forces with other stakeholders. Our approach on the investment side builds on the work of the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which Allianz co-founded and currently chairs. Furthermore, we encourage companies to implement net-zero strategies via our participation in The B Team, Climate Action 100+, the Transition Pathway Initiative, and the Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nFor further information and a full list of sustainability related memberships, please refer to the section \"06.3\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website.](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**\n\n### **Climate-related opportunities**\n\nOur materiality analysis under CSRD found climate-related opportunities to be material for the Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments. Our business strategy and our net-zero transition plan aim to systematically leverage opportunities to finance and insure a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nWe have strategically insured and invested in low-carbon assets for over a decade. With our 2023 Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan, we have also set quantitative targets for investing and insuring solutions that are needed in the net-zero transition. Our Sustainable Solutions program provides products and services that aim to create positive impacts with our (re-)insurance activities and investments. Growing sustainable solutions is among the topics included in the annual financial planning processes of our operating entities, in order to systematically identify growth and profitability potential. For further information on sustainable solutions, please refer to the section EU Taxonomy for non-life insurance.\n\nWe believe our intermediate climate targets will help us realize growth potential. For commercial insurance in particular, our transition plan includes a target to achieve 150% profitable growth in revenues from renewable energy and low-carbon technology solutions by 2030.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Climate policy dialogue**\n\nWe can achieve our targets only jointly with public policy and the real economy, as the necessary changes require broad support. For instance, sufficient frameworks and market incentives are required to bring down demand for emission-intensive products and to allocate capital in line with a 1.5 °C trajectory. The private sector, including insurers, can play an important role in raising awareness and making the business case for getting on track to limit global warming. To that end, we also work with policymakers and regulators to support sustainable financing and achieve the goals laid down in the Paris Agreement. We are advocating for global effective climate policy which should achieve the following:\n\n- − Embedding \"net-zero by 2050\" in short and long-term governmental climate targets, climate strategies, and emissions reduction plans, following the latest climate science in line with pathways of no or low overshoot of a 1.5 °C temperature rise.\n- − Developing sector policies to promote a swift and socially fair transition, including the development of more granular short-, medium- and long-term net-zero infrastructure plans.\n- − Implementing stringent carbon pricing to internalize the external costs of pollution, including a phase-out of direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies.\n- − Protecting nature and supporting regenerative forestry and agriculture. Supporting and redirecting fossil fuel-related subsidies to scale up new technologies that will provide solutions in hard-toabate sectors, e.g., carbon capture and storage, and green hydrogen.\n- − Promoting mandatory assured climate disclosure, including transition plans, GHG emissions, associated reduction targets, and alignment with 1.5 °C trajectories, ideally aligned internationally.\n- − Ensuring sustainable finance regulation that provides a defined, science-based, and reliable framework via a common taxonomy of sustainability, clarification of asset managers' duties, inclusion of sustainability in prudential regulation, and enhanced transparency of corporate reporting.\n\n### **1.5 °C alignment of targets**\n\nOur emission targets are aligned with credible, science-backed climate scenarios – such as those provided by the IPCC[1](#page-61-0) – that limit global warming in 2100 to 1.5 °C with only a limited or no overshoot of this temperature during this century. While the individual scenarios differ in their assumptions and narratives, they agree on a necessary emission reduction range for CO2 emissions of 36% to 69% from 2020 to 2030, with a median reduction of 48%.[2](#page-61-0) All our existing sub-portfolio targets with a global focus are in line with this. For our motor retail portfolio, the targeted reductions, which apply to nine European markets, are aligned with respective net-zero pathways.[3](#page-61-1)\n\nOur target year 2030 is defined as year-end 2029. Our base years for the 2030 targets in proprietary investments and operations continue to be the base year 2019 (building on existing 2025 targets). This also allows us to filter out the temporary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach taken for our P&C insurance targets was to focus on the most recent year for which data was available, this being 2022.\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\nFor our portfolio targets, there are generally two levers for decarbonization, that is reducing GHG emissions: either our portfolio companies – i.e., the customers we insure or the companies we invest in – reduce their GHG emissions, or we change the composition of our portfolio over time.\n\nThe former relies directly on GHG emission reductions in the real economy, which is not under our control. The latter can also occur naturally as part of typical insurance and investment business cycles in different lines of business, sectors, and individual customers, and is generally more under our control.\n\nWe aim to achieve GHG emission reductions through actions such as engaging customers, increasing exposures to lower-carbon business, and setting targets for lower-carbon technologies, as well as reducing our exposure to defined fossil-fuel business such as thermal coal. For our own operational GHG emissions, the main levers for reduction are Electricity, Buildings as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement. These elements are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\nWe apply both absolute and intensity GHG emission targets. Absolute GHG emissions refer to an absolute amount of GHG emissions associated with the respective business activity such as\n\n3\\_Target applies to the most relevant markets for Allianz, where adequate and reliable data is available.\n\n2\\_For GHG emissions, the range is 34 to 60, with a median of 43.\n\n<span id=\"page-61-1\"></span><span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>investing or insuring; absolute GHG emission targets seek to reduce the absolute amount of GHG emissions. GHG emission intensity and associated targets, on the other hand, harmonize the GHG emissions through a denominator that relates to a business activity. For example, GHG emissions per million invested or per million of premium.\n\n### **Property-Casualty insurance**\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our commercial portfolio will be reduced as we continue the planned implementation of our underwriting guidelines for coal as well as for oil and gas in line with announced thresholds and timelines. Our portfolio will also change as we continue to expand our risk appetite in the segment of renewable energy, low-carbon, and transition technologies. We will also benefit from GHG emission reductions in the real economy that our corporate customers pursue as part of their own net-zero strategies as required by governments, investors, and other stakeholders, and in addition, enabled by us as an insurer. A supportive policy environment is crucial here and is an important lever both for the net-zero transition in the global economy and for our target achievement.\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our motor retail portfolio are planned to be reduced through various initiatives; firstly, by increasing our share of battery electric vehicles for our markets in scope. It is also clear from **[market research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves)** that customers want to drive less, so we will encourage sustainable behaviors by providing offerings that reward these lifestyle changes. Another key lever will therefore be providing further incentives for reducing GHG emissions via mileage-based product offerings. When considering potential initiatives we took into account future projections in each of the countries for which we have set targets, including energy usage, vehicle usage and vehicle types. Our incentives will therefore balance the improvements we expect to see in the respective markets with Allianz actions aimed at closing the gap to our stated targets. We will therefore actively steer our in-scope portfolios to be more sustainable whilst benefiting from changes we predict to observe in market behavior.\n\nWe will also engage with customers to support their transition to electric mobility and meet their changing needs. We are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for battery electric vehicles and the related ecosystem, and to supporting our customers in transitioning to new forms of mobility.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_6th Assessment Report. Further scenarios used include the IEA's Net-Zero by 2050 and the One Earth Climate Model.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Proprietary investment**\n\nOur investment management function allows us to influence our portfolio allocation by setting targets and frameworks for our asset managers. These include defining concrete decarbonization targets for individual mandates, excluding certain high-emitting companies without reduction plans, and increasing target volumes for investments in climate solutions.\n\nIn order to achieve GHG emission reductions in the companies in our portfolio, we cultivate all types of engagement: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager engagement. As part of our multilateral engagement activities, the transition of whole sectors is a particular focus.\n\n### **Own operations**\n\nAs the specific definition of net-zero is still evolving for financial institutions and we anticipate CSRD requirements, we are no longer referring to the 2030 target for our Own Operations as a net-zero commitment. We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target. The rest of the decarbonization and removal targets for Own Operations remain as communicated in the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBy 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (for further information, please refer to the section \"Own Operations\"). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for year-end 2029, 65%[1](#page-62-0) versus a 2019 baseline.\n\nTo address the remaining 30%[2](#page-62-0) of the emissions we will use highquality carbon removal solutions.\n\nKey levers for GHG emission reduction will be the areas of Renewable Electricity, Buildings, as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement. In the area of Renewable Electricity, we source 100% renewable electricity from 2023 onwards and implement energy efficiency measures.[3](#page-62-0) For Buildings, we have developed a Buildings Standards Catalogue that includes various measures addressing GHG emission reduction. For Fleet and Business Travel, we aim to shift to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the latest, achieve a 40% reduction of GHG emissions from travel activities by 2025 compared to a 2019 baseline, and purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to address GHG emissions from air travel. For Procurement, we will ask 100% of global framework vendors in our supply chain that provide services globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 °C path by 2025.\n\n### **Carbon removal and carbon credits**\n\nIn the past reporting year, we did not use carbon removal and associated carbon credits when accounting for our GHG and the associated reduction targets. Our net-zero targets will likely require the use of atmospheric carbon removal in the respective net-zero targets year. For this, we expect to only use high-quality carbon removal. Our focus remains on GHG emission reductions.\n\n### **Governance**\n\nUltimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability, including climate, resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. This includes climate change and the net-zero transition plan, which has been approved by the Board of Management. Climate-related matters are typically part of all Group Sustainability Board meetings, which are held at least quarterly. For further information, please refer to the section \"Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\".\n\nOur Climate Change Strategy is rooted in the established sustainability governance (for further information, please refer to the section \"Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\") and its associated policies on sustainability, climate, and the energy sector. For further information, please refer to the section \"Overarching Policies\".\n\n### **Progress**\n\nIn the following sections on insurance, investments, and operations, we report on the details and progress of the implementation of the transition plan.\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>The Allianz sustainability approach integrates climate and sustainability-related considerations by applying group-wide corporate rules and sustainability instruments across underwriting and investment activities. Key processes include the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules, such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU) and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI).\n\nThe AS RRIM has been in place since 2013 and establishes a core set of principles and processes for the management of reputational risks and sustainability issues within the Group. It is owned by Group Risk, authorized by the Group Finance and Risk Committee and acknowledged by the Allianz SE Board of Management. The objective of the Standard is to proactively identify business decisions and business activities with the potential to trigger reputational issues and, where appropriate, take action to minimize their probability and/or impact. This Standard is mandatory for all operating entities of the Allianz Group. For 2024, the intention is for it to be superseded by the Allianz Standard for Communications and the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, Allianz has four energy-related guidelines in place: **[thermal coal](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-coal-based-business-models.pdf)**, **[oil sands](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-oil-sands-based-business-models.pdf)**, **[oil & gas](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-oil-gas-business-models.pdf)**, and **[renewable/low-carbon energy](file://WWG00M.ROOTDOM.NET/DFS/HOME/N6BED3Q/ICM/Downloads/Allianz%20Statement%20on%20renewable%20/%20low-carbon%20energy)**. The guidelines are owned by Global Sustainability and authorized by the Allianz SE Board of Management. They apply to proprietary investments and P&C insurance, including facultative reinsurance. Their common goals are to contribute to the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy technologies, to manage sustainability and reputational risks, and to achieve our net-zero related targets. The three fossil fuel guidelines define business practices and business models where we do not provide further services or investments along defined technical exclusion criteria. They typically differentiate between single-site restrictions – which apply to stand-alone P&C covers as well as direct project investments – and restrictions on company-level exposures. Purely to support renewable and lowcarbon technologies, we allow ring-fenced coverages of and investments into projects and subsidiaries of companies that are otherwise restricted due to the fossil-related energy guidelines. This is described in the Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline. The guidelines were introduced in 2015 (thermal coal), 2021 (oil sands), 2022 (oil & gas), and 2023 (renewable/low-carbon) respectively.\n\n2\\_Remaining 30 % means, that if we achieve 70 % reduction by year-end 2030, we will remove 30 %. If the reduction target is overachieved, then we remove the remaining gap to 100 %.\n\n3\\_For more details about the sources of the renewable electricity, please refer to section \"Energy and consumption mix\".\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nrefer to section \"Persons with disabilities\").

Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by Allianz Group Compliance.\n\nOur Compliance Management System helps to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\n\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2023, the Compliance Function continued to develop the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to meet the scope, and confirm compliance with global programs and local specificities. While CARE is primarily a challenged self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with Compliance Reviews of operating entities that are completed and coordinated by Allianz Group Compliance. Compliance Reviews are completed on a risk-based, three-yearly cycle.\n\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews, which assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust and Sales Compliance. This multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy has several benefits. First, operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Second, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide, and – if necessary – enforce remedial activities. Finally, people can learn from local and Group best practices, which further reinforces our compliance culture.\n\nAn online compliance management tool provides an overview of issues detected during the above activities. Users are required to use the tool to report and document actions taken to mitigate and follow up on any issues identified.\n\nThe information gathered is the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee is chaired by Allianz Group Compliance. This committee reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and the Allianz Group Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\n\nAs part of our Global Compliance Program, we follow international standards and applicable laws in relation to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz-specific rules.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. The current version of the Allianz Group Code of Conduct was approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management in 2020. New joiners at Allianz are informed of their obligation to adhere to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct. The key principles addressed by the Allianz Group Code of Conduct and the accompanying training are mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\nAllianz has zero tolerance of fraud. We are committed to complying with all applicable anti-fraud, anti-bribery, and anticorruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nZero tolerance applies regardless of who benefits from the fraud – Allianz as a company, other internal parties (employees, tied agents, intermediaries) or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz. To protect against fraud, we will take prompt and appropriate action where necessary – against employees, others acting on behalf of Allianz or third parties. This includes appropriately protecting customer and third-party data.\n\nSimilarly, Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving anything of value (anything monetary or nonmonetary that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain an improper personal or business advantage.\n\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report concerns and have multiple channels for doing so. These include via management, speaking directly with Allianz Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\n\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html) [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html)**. Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented, and managed according to internal guidelines and with strict confidentiality. The Allianz Group has specific procedures in place to ensure that no retaliation measures are taken against whistleblowers; reflecting our commitment to enable a healthy SpeakUp culture within the company. Retaliation measures are not accepted in any form.\n\nGroup Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign to remind employees of the avenues available for reporting.\n\n#### **Objectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters**\n\n| Topic      | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Progress and actions 2023                |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Compliance | Continue to enhance the<br>effectiveness of local<br>compliance organizations by<br>enriching our compliance<br>reviews, to further bolster<br>the governance and<br>processes of underlying<br>compliance organizations<br>across our OEs. | 2023 Compliance Review<br>Plan executed. |\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is a \"green\" classification system that translates the EU's environmental objectives into criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. The EU Taxonomy Regulation came into effect in 2020 and Allianz is reporting Taxonomy-eligibility for the third year in a row; however, Taxonomy-alignment is reported from the financial year 2023 onwards (described subsequently) only. The EU Taxonomy Regulation intends to provide increased transparency for stakeholders.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, the EU Commission published a guidance on Art. 8 EU Taxonomy Regulation. The document was assessed by Allianz but could not be fully considered for the 2023 reporting.[1](#page-96-0) Details about the implemented changes can be found in the respective subchapters.\n\n### **Allianz's approach to Sustainable Solutions in the Property and Casualty insurance business**\n\nWe are regarding the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the broader context of sustainable insurance solutions and are consequently reporting on it in combination with our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\nIt is an integral part of our strategy to not only insure our customers against risks, but also to support them in their challenges of a world which is about to transition to a more sustainable way of living and doing business. We aim to create real world impact through our business activities and contribute to ESG objectives based on science and in line with regulatory requirements and international agreements. This is based on the understanding that propertycasualty (P&C) insurance can support multiple ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation. The role of the insurance industry is not limited to the classic role as risk managers but goes beyond and includes the public expectations to accelerate a fair and just transition of economies and societies.\n\nTherefore, we have established a comprehensive framework for Allianz Sustainable Solutions, including guidelines, screening criteria and definitions, a certification grid, governance, and defined processes to safeguard us against greenwashing risks, provide strategic guidance to explore business opportunities, and take corporate responsibility for our planet.\n\nUnder the Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework, the Technical Screening Criteria (Annex 2, 10.1, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139) (Climate Delegated Act) supplementing the EU Taxonomy Regulation) serve as minimum requirements to qualify products as sustainable. Simultaneously, the Technical Screening Criteria are used as guidance for our product development with the objective to increase the resilience of our insurance activities and support our customers in building adaptive capacity.\n\nIn 2023, the first year of Taxonomy-alignment reporting, we have been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and have started developing and implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy Regulation for non-life insurance business: Underwriting of climate-related perils**\n\nFor non-life insurance activities, the Climate Delegated Act has established \"climate change adaptation\" as (the only) potential substantial contribution to environmental objectives as laid out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Climate Delegated Act and the Technical Screening Criteria set forth therein predominantly expect insurance activities to adequately reflect climate-related risks and support customers and society in building resilience against the adverse effects of climate change. It consequently reflects the traditional role of the insurance industry as risk manager. Only the \"do no significant harm\" and \"minimum safeguards\" criteria set additional requirements for Taxonomy-alignment beyond the contribution to climate change adaptation.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation does not impose business restrictions or material requirements for insurance activities but introduces disclosure obligations for the insurance Lines of Business (LoBs) in scope. The disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned revenues allows for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios, to channel capital flows towards Sustainable Investments.[2](#page-96-0)\n\n#### <span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>**EU Taxonomy-eligibility**\n\nThe eight LoBs of non-life insurance laid down in the Technical Screening Criteria are in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (\"Taxonomy-eligible\"), as the insurance products sold under these LoBs have the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation. We define all P&C LoBs laid down in Annex 2 section 10.1 of the Climate Delegated as eligible and they have been included in the Taxonomyalignment screening. The template \"Taxonomy KPIs for non-life underwriting\" below also includes our Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible proportions for financial year 2022. Since Taxonomy-alignment has been assessed for the first time by Allianz for financial year 2023, the 2022 figures are not applicable for these lines and marked as such.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy-alignment**\n\nTaxonomy-alignment of an activity goes beyond Taxonomy-eligibility. For non-life insurance business, it implies that the insurance activity substantially contributes to climate change adaptation, does not significantly harm the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards, and complies with the Technical Screening Criteria. We have screened our entire eligible non-life insurance portfolio under the Article 3 Taxonomy Regulation and the Technical Screening Criteria and are reporting accordingly.\n\nIt is in the nature of new regulations that not all details are specified, and a common understanding and application needs to be developed across markets to achieve consistency and comparability. In order to ensure a consistent application across all Allianz entities, we have developed internal guidelines and also taken a conservative approach, where screening criteria left room for interpretation. The following illustrates those aspects that we deem to be the most important and challenging:\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Draft Commission Notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomyeligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (21 December 2023).\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Further information on Sustainable Investments can be found in section \"02.2\" of the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Leadership in modeling and pricing of climate risks**\n\nState-of-the-art modelling techniques(1.1): Assessing and pricing risks adequately is key for a sustainable and resilient insurance operation. The Allianz approach to state-of-the-art pricing is the Technical Price System as part of our Technical Excellence initiative. In the existing Technical Price Certification (TPC), portfolios are screened on a regular basis across the Allianz Group. A successful TPC requires (but is not limited to), that the technical price is available at policy level. This includes the best estimate of all future, expected costs of the risk (including the expected ultimate loss) as a forward-looking scenario. Both output from hazard mapping and NatCat risk models are included in expected claims costs. Where and to the extent that a portfolio meets our internal TPC requirements, we have concluded that predicted costs of climate related hazards are properly reflected in the Technical Price at best estimate.\n\nProvide incentives for risk reduction (1.3): This criterion is based on the fundamental understanding, that the insurer should protect itself and set incentives for customers to protect themselves or their assets, against the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, it is necessary, however sufficient, if the climate-related exposure is considered in pricing as a price signal of risk (e.g., hazard zones) or in terms and conditions such as deductibles or limits, that serve as a differentiator for respective exposures.\n\n#### **Product design**\n\nRisk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders(2.1): The regulator expects an insurance product to include risk-based rewards for customers to take preventive actions in order to protect themselves or their insured assets against climate change risks. Other than for the previous criterion (\"Provide incentives for risk-reduction), differentiation only related to the location of a risk is not sufficient. We define preventive actions as any specific measures that can be taken by customers if they are suitable to reduce either the frequency or severity of climate change related claims. They must be considered in the product and be offered to all customers. Risk-based rewards must be reflected in the technical price, and there has to be a direct relation between the preventive measure taken by the customer, and the riskbased reward granted. Hence, general deductibles which do not refer to specific preventive measures or no claims discounts are not sufficient.\n\nThe distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures (2.2): The regulator sees adaptation to climate change risks as an overall societal objective to which insurers and their customers should contribute, since risk-prevention is a key lever for reducing the overall economic burden. Thus, the distribution strategy must include measures to ensure that customers (new and existing) are informed about the preventive measures and the relevance of such preventive measure that they could take. Information on the relevance of preventive measures can be shared individually (e.g., through customer specific risk assessment reports in commercial business) or in general, which is appropriate for retail business (e.g., through information in newsletters, regular contract related communication or terms and conditions). It is also appropriate to briefly inform the customers about the topic and direct them to more detailed information, for instance on a company website.\n\n#### **Do no significant harm (\"DNSH\") – Climate change mitigation**\n\nThe DNSH criterion defines which insurance activities related to customers engaged in the fossil fuel value chain must not be classified as sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned). We are taking a mainly conservative approach and define the fossil fuel value chain extensively as upstream (e.g., exploration, extraction), midstream (e.g., transport, storage, pipelines) or downstream (e.g., refinery, trading and sales including gas stations) activities or related assets. Additionally, we consider commercially used fossil fuel power plants to be part of the fossil fuel value chain. Beyond that, the end-use of fossil fuels is not in scope of this criterion (e.g., combustion engine vehicles or oil-fired heating systems). Thus, the DNSH criterion is automatically fulfilled for retail business, as private use is considered as end-use.\n\nIn our portfolio screening approach, we applied the International Standard of Industrial Classification of economic activities (ISIC codes) to identify policies which are not in line with the DNSH criterion as defined above: The different ISIC codes have been classified as either compliant with DNSH, not compliant with DNSH or to be assessed on an individual customer level. We have screened our portfolios against this internal classification system. As our commercial risks are allocated to ISIC codes (or comparable national or internal classifications), we could identify policies and revenues which do not comply with DNSH.\n\nThere are no further environmental objectives next to \"climate change mitigation\" that insurance activities could significantly harm according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, meaning that an <span id=\"page-97-0\"></span>assessment of further DNSH criteria is not applicable. These are still indicated with a \"Y\" in the template \"Taxonomy KPIs for non-life underwriting\" below.\n\n#### **Minimum Safeguards**\n\nTaxonomy-aligned activities needs to be carried out in compliance with Minimum Safeguards with respect to the value chain (i.e., with respect to policyholders in the insurance context). Minimum Safeguards require a due diligence process which is aligned with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. This is ensured by our Sustainability referral process governed by the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM), which applies to insurance transactions following a risk-based approach. For more information on the Sustainability referral process, please refer to the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework, version 5.0 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**.\n\n#### **Overall results of EU Taxonomy Screening**\n\nFor the financial year 2023 we are reporting a relatively low share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues. Risk-based rewards for preventative actions and the respective advice to customers turned out to be the most important aspects. We have been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and started developing and implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n### **Allianz's Sustainable Solutions**\n\nChanging customer expectations and demands as well as regulatory evolution are modifying the role of the insurance industry and require a dedicated strategy to manage the impact of sustainability in P&C Business. The Principles for Sustainable Insurance published by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) outline a strategic approach where all activities in the insurance value chain – including interactions with stakeholders – are performed in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental and social issues. The sustainability requirements aim to reduce risks, develop innovative solutions, improve business performance, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability.[1](#page-97-0)\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nSustainable Solutions framework. As a result, our overall approach for assessing and classifying Sustainable Solutions was revised. The former Sustainable Solution definition and its application were replaced by the new Sustainable Solutions framework as of January 1st, 2023. This also enables us to report on Sustainable Solutions based on the new Sustainable Solutions framework for the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Sustainable Solutions framework is based on regulatory requirements (e.g., the EU Taxonomy Regulation) as an integral part. However, it goes beyond and includes additional product elements which contribute to ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation to support our customers in their transition.\n\nWe define a Sustainable (P&C insurance) Solution as an insurance product or service that substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and to one or more further environmental, social, or governance objectives, without doing significant harm to any of the other objectives, which is in line with the principles of Minimum Safeguards and hence supports our customers in transitioning towards an environmentally or socially sustainable way of doing business or living.\n\nTo ensure compliance across the Allianz Group, the Sustainable Solutions framework is codified in internal policies and applies as a harmonized and mandatory framework for all Allianz P&C entities, including a certification process for sustainable products and services. Eligible objectives and suitable product elements have been predefined. They were derived from the EU Taxonomy Regulation – where available[1](#page-98-0) – and the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals, and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- − Climate change mitigation: avoid, reduce or remove GHG emissions.\n- − Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: contribute to good status of water bodies.\n- − Transition to a circular economy: promote durability, re-use and recycling.\n- − Pollution prevention and control: improve quality of air, water, and land.\n\nAgainst this background, we developed an enhanced Allianz – Protection, conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n- − Encourage and expand access to insurance and services for helpers or socially disadvantaged groups.\n- − Foster socially responsible behavior or engagement.\n\nIn 2023, we generated € 3,026 mn revenues from certified Sustainable Solutions in our P&C business. Hence, the Sustainable Solutions framework contributes to our overall purpose: We secure your future.\n\n### **Information on data sources for revenue disclosure**\n\nData collection is conducted in the Solvency II P&C LoB reporting infrastructure. The system is set up in SAP. Information is based on nonconsolidated LoB reporting.\n\n#### **Definition of premiums**\n\nIn line with the requirements that are set forth by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz follows the principle to use figures as premium base that relate to financial reporting and are communicated externally through Allianz financial statements – Total Business Volume (TBV). TBV presents a measure for the overall amount of business generated during a specific reporting period. As TBV by itself does not represent a premium related to the insurance coverage (it also includes fee and commission income), the following adjustment has been performed: As fee and commission income are not directly linked to the provision of insurance coverage, they are eliminated to arrive at the coverage related premium figure.\n\nThis premium figure represents the required gross written premiums level.\n\n#### **Determination of (retro)ceded premium share**\n\nFor natural catastrophe events, the Allianz Group has a centralized program in place that pools exposures from its subsidiaries through internal reinsurance agreements. Allianz SE limits exposures in this portfolio through external reinsurance. Subsidiaries of the Allianz Group generally do not enter into individual external reinsurance agreements for natural catastrophe events. Accordingly, a <span id=\"page-98-1\"></span><span id=\"page-98-0\"></span>breakdown into single Taxonomy-aligned products is not available, as indicated in the template below.\n\nThe guidance on EU Taxonomy Reporting[2](#page-98-1) published by the EU Commission in December 2023 states that insurance undertakings should use those insurance premiums that only pertain to the coverage of climate-related perils for the purpose of computing Taxonomyalignment. Hence, only the portion of the premium from Taxonomyaligned products related to the exposure stemming from climate related perils could be reported as sustainable revenue. We applied this guidance to calculate the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues.\n\nFor our reinsurance contracts issued (third party), we prepared our systems to report the entire premium of any treaty providing coverage for climate-related perils for financial year 2023 reporting, based on the prevailing market practice and interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. With the new requirement to unbundle the premium into solely climate risk related, our systems need further adaptation to systematically allow this premium unbundling in the required quality and could not be done in time for financial year 2023.\n\n### **Ensure implementation into our business**\n\nOur Sustainable Solutions framework and its application have been integrated into the binding Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU), which governs the rules and principles for P&C underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture as described in the Group Risk Policy.\n\nAs of January 2023, all newly developed products and services must be assessed and classified under the Sustainable Solutions framework in the product development process by our operating entities. Results are validated by a dedicated function within our Group Center Global P&C, which has the responsibility to approve or not approve submitted products as a sustainable and in case of a positive approval, issue a respective certification.\n\nIn addition, as of January 2024, products or services may only be labeled, advertised, or in any other way promoted as Sustainable Solutions (or any other term that implies the sustainability of a solution, such as \"green\" or \"social\"), if the product or service is certified under our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_The Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework applies to all P&C insurance LoBs.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Draft Commission Notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-\n\neligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (21 December 2023).\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Allianz's actions and measurements**\n\nThe Sustainable Solutions framework incorporates material ESG objectives into P&C decision-making and portfolio management processes. We aim to shift our product portfolio towards sustainable products by using the Sustainable Solutions framework as guiding considerations in the product development process.\n\nAllianz has always offered comprehensive insurance cover for climate-related perils. Still, closing the insurance protection gap remains a major challenge in many markets. To increase the penetration rate of covers for natural catastrophes, our product strategy is moving towards coverage for natural catastrophes per default (with opt-out elements).\n\nTo manage climate-related risks adequately, we are continuously improving our risk- and pricing-models by integrating the latest data and information on climate change impacts through forward-looking NatCat scenarios and global hazard maps. However, effective adaptation to climate change does not only require adequate pricing of risks, but also individual measures by customers. We have therefore started considering preventative actions taken by the customer in our products and pricing models. Living up to our role as a climate risk manager, we are also integrating advisory services into our customer communication and provide relevant information to customers, for example, on how to build stronger resilience against climate-related events.\n\nIn addition, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for low-carbon technologies – such as battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the related ecosystem – as well as for renewable energy technologies, to support the transition of our customers towards more environment-friendly solutions. For instance, Allianz entities offer BEV insurance products, which meet the specific needs of the new ecosystem such as range anxiety, comprehensive coverage of accessory equipment, and coverage for battery disposal. Within our commercial energy and construction business, we offer insurance to cover the setup, installation, and operation of renewable energy projects such as solar and wind farms, both onshore and offshore.\n\nMaterial ESG objectives are also considered in our claims processes. We have started integrating environmental standards into our claims processes by encouraging or incentivizing our customers, car repair shops, and manufacturers to repair instead of replace or to use refurbished parts, where possible. Moreover, we started increasing our claims payments to our customers to not only rebuild damaged assets such as buildings, but to use more sustainable or energyefficient building materials or elements (build back better), as well as building more resilience against the adverse effects of climate change (build back stronger).\n\n### **Allianz's ambition**\n\nOur ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition to net zero, as well as to support our customers in their transition to environmentfriendly choices.\n\nThe new Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework was launched in January 2023 across all our entities. This includes qualitative targets for the financial year 2023 for to the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating entities to ensure the implementation of Sustainable Solutions. To accelerate the journey in 2024, we have set quantitative growth targets for to the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating entities.\n\nIn our reinsurance lines, we initiated discussions with our clients on their fossil fuel related exposures in order to support their net-zero transition pathways.\n\nAs of 2024, our entities will continue to report internally on a regular basis on the following KPIs:\n\n- − Taxonomy-aligned revenues\n- − Sustainable Solutions-certified revenues.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Template: The underwriting KPI for non-life insurance and reinsurance undertakings**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                 | Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation |                                |                                | DNSH (Do Not Significant Harm) |                               |                  |           |                                |                    |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------|--|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                                                             | Absolute premiums<br>2023                             | Proportion of<br>premiums 2023 | Proportion of<br>premiums 2022 | Climate change<br>mitigation   | Water and marine<br>resources | Circular economy | Pollution | Biodiversity and<br>ecosystems | Minimum safeguards |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                 | € mn                                                  | %                              | %                              | Y/N                            | Y/N                           | Y/N              | Y/N       | Y/N                            | Y/N                |  |\n| A.1.

This means that for Taxonomy reporting as an investor in other undertakings, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Where the Allianz Group fully controls a non-financial investment – including real estate – the scope is not limited in that regard.\n\nThe eligibility and alignment share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments or non-financial assets. For controlled investments and mortgages with property as collateral, Allianz has three main asset classes: real estate held for investment, commercial and retail mortgages, and renewable investments. Allianz's minority interest investments in investees are mostly through publicly listed stocks and bonds. Eligibility for Allianz's controlled assets has been determined for all six environmental objectivesthat are listed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Alignment reporting is produced for the two published environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAs in 2022, all real estate asset classes including mortgages are considered 100% eligible, with the addition in 2023 of joint ventures in real estate. For further information, please refer to section \"Changes to proprietary investment reporting\". Eligibility (and alignment) for Allianz investments in investees is attained via reported data provided by Moody's Analytics.\n\nThe focus of Taxonomy reporting for 2023 is alignment, which is a step beyond eligibility. For an asset to be aligned, three steps are necessary, which is first, the substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives in line with specific Technical Screening Criteria, second, meeting the DNSH criterion (related to the other environmental objectives) and third, meeting the minimum safeguards criteria. Naturally, eligibility is a prerequisite for alignment.\n\nAlignment screening relates to the first two climate change objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Allianz has attained a relatively low alignment quota from screening our own portfolio. The main constraints included lack of data availability for commercial mortgages, and lack of comparative data for real estate held for investment (typically for Energy Performance Certificates determined on demand data that could not be benchmarked to the top 15% of real estate stock).\n\nFor retail mortgage loans especially, Allianz uses a third-party provider (SkenData) that employs an EU Taxonomy model to screen real estate objects at a building level. The criteria used to assess energy performance are equal to the ones used in energy performance certificates. The DNSH criteria considers both the exposure and vulnerability (after considering mitigating action). Overall risk materiality is then determined for each building jointly assessing the said factors. Only when such risk is classified as low or medium, the real estate object can be considered Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses only reported data for listed assets (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent-level data is sourced. If that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data from the ultimate group parent entity. Taxonomy-alignment is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data. The data hierarchy logic is suppressed for investment funds. For further information, please refer to section \"Limitations of reported numbers\".\n\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year 2023 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level. For further information, please refer to section \"Limitations of reported numbers\".\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nAllianz complies with the EU Taxonomy Regulation by reporting the respective Taxonomy KPIs. For investments, these numbers give us a technical view on the current status of our investment portfolio with regards to their Taxonomy-alignment. At this stage, the EU Taxonomy investment criteria is not used for business or investment steering purposes. However, we continue to monitor the evolution of the Taxonomy Regulation to cover further sectors of the economy and become a tool for portfolio steering in the future.\n\n### **Nuclear and Gas Delegated act**\n\nIn addition, as part of the 2023 Taxonomy reporting, Allianz is required to disclose its exposure to the six nuclear and gas activities stipulated in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Annex III). This disclosure seeks to elicit the portion of aligned investments that are a result of the stated activities. For 2023, Allianz's exposure to nuclear and gas activities is considered very small (around 2 % of aligned assets for turnover and CAPEX based on total alignment figures). However, additional disclosure tables have been produced with the limitation that some KPIs were unable to be calculated due to lack of data at the climate objective level.\n\n### **Reporting about third-party asset management**\n\nIn 2023, Allianz took the decision to de-scope third-party asset management from EU Taxonomy investment reporting, in line with current market practice and interpretation of existing regulatory requirements for 2023 reporting.\n\n### **Calculation of KPIs**\n\nThe main alignment KPIs for 2023 include alignment based on turnover and alignment based on CAPEX. For our financial investments, each KPI is determined using only reported data for the investee. If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with a turnover alignment of 10 % and the book value of the investment is 100, Allianz would report a turnover alignment balance of 10. And if Allianz has covered assets of 200, then the final alignment share based on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %. The total alignment based on turnover additionally includes alignment shares from Allianz's own investment real estate held for investment, retail mortgages, and renewable investments. The total alignment KPI based on CAPEX is determined in the same way.\n\nFor 2023, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer investment KPIs detailed in Annex IX/X of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Delegated Act). As mentioned earlier, the main changes regarding the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for 2023 are the introduction of alignment KPIs (by turnover and CAPEX) and the separate tables required for nuclear/gas exposures. The Annex X template has a number of shortcomings, with the main one concerning its specification of the non-eligible KPIs. Eligibility and alignment fractions are determined as a percentage of the turnover or CAPEX denominators. As such, these rows need to be made explicit in the template. In the absence of these rows, the numbers have been provided in the footnotes for completeness.\n\n### **Changes to proprietary investment reporting**\n\nFor Taxonomy reporting in 2023, there were some changes to how Allianz presents its numbers.\n\nThe first change relates to the treatment of cash and cash equivalents. In 2022, Allianz considered these as non-eligible; however, they were included as part of the denominator for KPI calculations. After reassessing the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz has determined that cash and cash equivalents should not be included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. Annex X of the Disclosure Delegated Act defines in-scope assets of insurance and reinsurance undertakings as \"all direct and indirect investments, including investments in collective investment undertakings and participations, loans and mortgages, property, plant and equipment, as well as, where relevant, intangibles\". Cash and cash equivalents are specifically not included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. This view is affirmed b[y EIOPA's technical advice on key](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf)  [performance indicators under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf)  [of February 26, 2021](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf) (EIOPA-21-184).\n\nThe second change relates to the asset classes considered relevant for eligibility. In 2022, Allianz considered investments in real estate funds to be 100 % eligible on the basis that the vast majority of the underlying investments were in real estate. In 2023, Allianz determined that, by the same logic, its joint venture real estate investments should also be 100 % eligible. The impact of this reassessment leads to a small reclassification from non-eligible to eligible for this asset class for 2023.\n\nFinally, in 2023, the transition to a new accounting regime has meant that most of Allianz's real estate investment held for investments are measured at fair value, as opposed to cost less accumulated depreciation. In particular, this has led to higher valuations of the stated asset class compared to the previous year.\n\n### **Limitations of reported numbers**\n\nFor 2023, Allianz is relying on reported information from investees for the year 2022. For that year, financial institutions were not required to report alignment figures; as a result, alignment quotas for the said companies will be low or zero.\n\nFor investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach where possible to report fund eligibility, leveraging data in the Tripartite Template (TPT). However, look-through coverage of companies was limited for 2023 due to limited adoption of the TPT and the inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility. In addition, the aforementioned data hierarchy approach is suppressed for investment funds: if investment level look-through data is not available, eligibility is assumed to be zero. This is because listed asset data for Allianz SE has been collected for the underwriting KPI, which has a high eligibility share of 79 %. This is deemed inappropriately high for investment funds. The conservative approach is designed to mitigate the risk of reporting eligibility figures that may not be representative of the underlying investments. Going forward, Allianz aims to expand the look-through capability for investment funds.\n\nIn addition, a complete screening of our renewables portfolio was not possible for United States based SPVs. The said investments are 100% eligible and likely have a high degree of alignment but have not been considered as such for 2023 reporting due to inadequate data at the time of reporting.\n\nUnder the EU Taxonomy Regulation, our business strategy, product design processes, and engagement with customers and counterparties concept are being integrated into our business activities, but are evolving and can be further developed as alignment reporting matures and a market-based solution for fund look-through is widely adopted.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Template:

operations, supply chain, Life and Health (re)insurance (Life/Health), Property and Casualty (re)insurance (Property-Casualty), as well as our proprietary and third-party investments business. It follows the double materiality principles as per the CSRD/ESRS and the guidance provided by EFRAG in its Draft Implementation Guidance on the materiality assessment from December 2023. The CSRD DMA identifies material impacts, risks, and opportunities that (may) arise in the short-, medium- or long-term, or a mix thereof, following ESRS 1. In terms of topical scope, the CSRD DMA covers both the sustainability matters addressed by the topical ESRS as well as Allianz-specific sustainability matters not (sufficiently) covered therein, based on the previous GRI materiality assessment.\n\nWhen assessing impact materiality, we consider positive and adverse actual and potential impacts caused by, contributed to, or connected with the Allianz Group. Such impacts are assessed based on the criteria scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood. When assessing financial materiality – namely, the materiality of risks and opportunities for the Allianz Group – we take into account the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of the potential financial effects. In this context, we also consider our dependencies on the continuing use of natural, human, and social resources. Financial materiality is assessed in accordance with established Allianz-specific risk assessment processes. For opportunities, the identification is tied to our strategy, as the fact that a strategy to exploit opportunities exists is a precondition for (likely) materialization.\n\nAs to risks, besides the broad range of risk assessments established within the Allianz Group (e.g. Top Risk Assessment), a dedicated in-depth risk assessment covering the CSRD topics alongside the value chain was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 to enhance the CSRD DMA going forward. Until this deep-dive is completed and given that guidance for financial companies and industry practice is still evolving, for 2023 reporting, all CSRD topics are generally considered in scope due to potential risks (e.g. policy or reputational risks). This means that we describe (potential) risks based on a conservative initial approach, thereby reporting on topics broadly, despite the majority of them being (currently) considered to be at most designated \"low materiality\" from a risk perspective. In a similar vein, our impact assessment will be regularly reviewed to reflect, for example, evolving regulation and methodology as well as increasing availability of portfolio-specific data.\n\nThe CSRD DMA is primarily based on desktop research and internal experts' evaluations, with consideration of in-house and external data where available and appropriate, depending on the area of the value chain being assessed:\n\n- − For our own operations, supply chain, Life/Health, and Property-Casualty retail business, we use desktop research as well as inhouse and external data, where available (e.g. GHG emissions), tailored to the Allianz business context and complemented by expert evaluations. In addition, for our Life/Health commercial lines, a country analysis is performed to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and human rights issues.\n- − For our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, the CSRD DMA is data-driven with the aim to identify (potential) impacts, risks, and opportunities related to the portfolio(s) of the Allianz Group, leveraging internal and external available data sources at country, sector, and investment level. Sources include sector proxies for environmental impacts from the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) data base, as well as, for investments, for example principle adverse impacts on sustainability factors (SFDR PAIs) or ESG sub-scores by MSCI. In addition, we conduct a country analysis to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and human rights issues, similar to the analysis mentioned above for our Life/Health commercial lines. The evaluations of these criteria were enhanced by consulting a broad range of relevant business experts, in order to ensure consideration of Allianz portfoliospecific information, especially where there was of a lack of (sufficiently granular) data. Allianz will continue to work on data coverage and quality over the coming years. As to proprietary investments, the first CSRD DMA focuses on General Account investments. The inclusion of unit-linked investments into the CSRD DMA will be revisited during the annual revision process. When assessing impact materiality at portfolio level, we apply absolute thresholds based on gross written premiums for our commercial (re)insurance business and based on assets under management for proprietary investments. This ensures that both multiple smaller impacts and fewer larger impacts are considered in the assessment. Similar to the approach for risks, we tend to include\n\n(potential) adverse impacts in the reporting scope at this stage, following a conservative approach.\n\n− Given that regulatory requirements and market practice are evolving, the assessment of impacts, risks, and opportunities for our third-party asset management has been initiated based on business experts' indicative qualitative assessment as a first step, assessing the extent to which the asset management services offered are associated with (potential) sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities. We will further develop our materiality assessment process for the third-party asset management business for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe CSRD DMA conducted for the financial year 2023 suggests that topics across all topical ESRS are generally material for the Allianz Group, with the level of materiality, the number of material matters considered therein, and the primary drivers of materiality alongside the value chain differing across topics. For example, while the topic \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) is material from an own operations and value chain perspective, the materiality of further environmental topics (ESRS E2-E5) is generally associated with providing financing and insurance to corporate clients. As to social and governancerelated topics, they are particularly relevant from our own operations perspective (esp. ESRS S1, G1), while also playing a role in our value chain (esp. ESRS S2, S3, S4). For our third-party asset management, we have initiated a more detailed assessment, which will be reflected in our reporting for 2024. In addition to the topics \"Climate change\" and \"Own workforce\", \"Business conduct\" remains a key topic for the Allianz Group. Also, our ongoing focus on customer experience alongside the customer journey remains unchanged (ESRS S4), given its materiality and relevance to the Allianz sustainability strategy.\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\nderivatives and investments in infrastructure, private equity and real estate.\n\nOf the financial instruments reported in the consolidated financial statements, financial assets in the amount of € 8,829 million are measured at amortised cost and € 562,693million at fair value through other comprehensive income. Of this amount, € 543,510 million is attributable to debt instruments for which a risk provision totalling € 1,125 million was recognised as at the reporting date to take account of impairments for expected credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 (Expected Credit Loss), as applicable since 1 January 2023.\n\nThe measurement of financial instruments whose fair value must be determined using valuation models or value indicators from third parties is subject to uncertainty, as input parameters that are not observable in an active market are used for the measurement or comparative values are not always available and therefore estimated values are also used. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are also included in the model valuation to take account of impairments for expected credit losses.\n\nModel-measured financial instruments are subject to an increased measurement risk due to the reduced objectivity and the underlying judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors. As the estimates and assumptions used, in particular those relating to interest rates and cash flows, and the valuation methods applied may have a material impact on the valuation of these financial instruments and on the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance, and extensive disclosures on valuation methods and judgements are also required in the notes, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls for the valuation of model-measured financial instruments and financial instruments measured on the basis of third-party indicators. In addition, we assessed, among other things, the integrity of the underlying data and the process for determining the assumptions, estimates and forward-looking information used in the valuation.\n\nWith the support of our internal valuation specialists, we also assessed the appropriateness of the methods applied by the executive directors to determine the fair values and the parameters used. We compared the methods and assumptions used to calculate valuation adjustments in the financial year with recognised practices and industry standards and examined the extent to which they are suitable for proper accounting. To assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of impairment for expected credit losses, we involved internal specialists with particular expertise in the field of credit risk modelling. We also evaluated the disclosures on valuation methods and judgements contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn the basis of the audit procedures performed, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and assumptions used by the executive directors to measure certain financial instruments (modelled and measured based on third-party indicators) and the consideration of forward-looking information in determining the impairment for expected credit losses are appropriate overall and that the explanations and disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of financial instruments are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and \"Investments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\n- − the group statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 315d HGB included in section \"Corporate Governance Statement\" of the group management report\n- − the disclosures marked as unaudited in the group management report\n\n#### The other information comprises further\n\n- − the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- − all remaining parts of the group annual report excluding crossreferences to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial group statement included in the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- − is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- − otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and \n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a nonfinancial group statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial group statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and terms in section \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial group statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, of the group management report as well as of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, and whether the non-financial group statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements and with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Company's executive directors, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the nonfinancial group statement.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- − Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- − Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report and of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- − Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- − Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- − Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- − Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- − Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- − Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- − Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial group statement as a whole. As\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\nexplained in the description of the responsibilities of the executive directors, the executive directors have interpreted the wording and terms contained in the relevant regulations; the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to inherent uncertainties mentioned in this description. Those inherent uncertainties in the interpretation apply to our audit accordingly.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n",

The handwriting is cursive and slightly stylized.\n\nIn 2023, the theme that dominated the global economy, capital markets and society alike was the fight against inflation. Over the past year, no one has been immune to inflation's corrosive effects on savings and the affordability of goods. The monetary policies that were taken to mitigate inflation now appear to have arrested its trajectory, but present manifold challenges both for businesses and consumers.\n\nThroughout a period in which our customers and partners experienced significant increases in their cost of living and challenges in sustaining their businesses, we maintained our focus on delivering the greatest possible value to them through our customer service and product offerings. For our shareholders, we steered our business model and managed our capital position to overcome inflationary challenges, ultimately contributing to a record performance. Our ability to manage inflation in all its forms is proving to be a distinct competitive advantage for Allianz.\n\nWe have successfully consolidated our leading position as one of the largest global insurers and active asset managers, one that is able to leverage its scale, global reach, and diversified business model to address the financial and protection needs of more people around the world. At the end of the 2023, our share price reached a 20-year high, our total business volume increased by 5.5 % to € 162 bn, and our operating profit reached another record level, rising by 6.7 % to € 14.7 bn.\n\nOur Property-Casualty segment grew strongly by 8.4 % to almost € 77 bn in total business volume. The operating profit topped € 6.9 bn for the first time, despite another year that was marked by increased claims resulting from more frequent and severe natural catastrophes. This clearly confirms our healthy underlying profitability and underwriting expertise.\n\nOur Life/Health segment demonstrated robust growth, with the value of new business increasing by 2.2 % to € 4.0 bn as we developed attractive solutions to protect our customers from the effects of inflation on their savings. The operating profit of € 5.2 bn was strong, making the Life/Health segment a resilient contributor to our earnings power.\n\nOur Asset Management segment proved resilient managing through a volatile environment to deliver an operating profit of € 3.1 bn. We recorded third-party net inflows of € 21.5 bn – a signal of active investors’ readiness to invest in the market through us – and we achieved growth in third-party assets under management to € 1.7 tn. Together with our continued strong investment outperformance, this bodes well for further improvements in growth and profitability.\n\nOur shareholders benefited from an outstanding total return of 27 % for the year, outperforming the European insurance sector, our direct peers, and the broader European stock market. This performance is backed by our financial strength and affirmed by the leading financial rating agencies which place Allianz in the top of our category, at AA (S&P Global), Aa2 (Moody's) and A+ (AM Best) respectively, and fully in line with our ratings objectives. Looking ahead, we will focus on unlocking the benefits of our scale, further increasing our productivity, and translating excellent customer experience into profitable customer growth.\n\nAlongside our strong financial performance, Allianz's organizational health further raises our confidence that our company will remain resilient in the face of volatility and be able to exceed our stakeholders' expectations in the future:\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nOur brand value is stronger than ever before. Allianz is the world's leading insurance and asset management brand for the fifth time in a row according to Interbrand's 2023 Best Global Brands ranking, with our brand value exceeding USD 20 bn for the first time. In addition, in an increasingly polarized world, Allianz remains the most trusted insurance brand among our peer set across all stakeholder groups, according to Edelman Trust Intelligence data. We embrace our societal responsibility and leverage our strength, stability, and skills to address the root causes of polarization and secure the future of those who put their trust in us.\n\n#### Our customers value the care and service we provide in their moments\n\nof greatest need. We evaluate our business performance based on the experience of our customers, as their satisfaction and loyalty are among the most important drivers of our growth. Our latest Net Promoter Score®results, which measure our customers' loyalty through customers' willingness to recommend Allianz, show that three-quarters of our operating entities outperformed their peers, a remarkable jump of 11 percentage points from last year. And we are also proud that 59 % of our operating entities have achieved the distinction of Loyalty Leadership status, which is a leading indicator for our future market expansion.\n\n#### Our success would be impossible without our engaged and healthy\n\nworkforce. We are therefore extremely proud that Allianz achieved record results in all three globally benchmarked indices of employee engagement against a declining industry trend: our Inclusive Meritocracy Index increased by 2 percentage points reaching best-inclass levels, our Work Well Index+ rose by 5 percentage points, and our Employee Engagement Index by 3 percentage points. In addition, our employee share ownership reached 70 %, which is a remarkable expression of our people's confidence in our organization. Our industry leadership in diversity reflects the strength of our workforce and its preparedness for the future, and this talent advantage is recognized by the global Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index 2023, which ranked Allianz first in the insurance category for the 5th consecutive year.\n\nHowever, our efforts to ensure resilience and to protect what is most valuable to our customers exceed our organization and touch on society at large. In 2023, we again demonstrated our industry leadership in sustainability by publishing our first comprehensive netzero transition plan – with concrete milestones to be achieved by 2030 – detailing our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in the investment of policyholder funds and our property and casualty portfolios by 2050.\n\nAs we look ahead, our corporate health and resilience are foundational to our ability to deliver strong results and returns amid even the most challenging environments – especially in the increasingly polarized world we live in today. We are well-prepared to lead in this context, drawing on the principles of sustainability, strength, and inclusion at which Allianz has excelled since our founding 134 years ago. Our company and our purpose are as relevant and important today as they have ever been, and we will not shy away from this calling.\n\nOn behalf of our management team and our employees, I thank you for your trust in the Allianz Group and look forward to earning your continued support in the year ahead.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nClair Zala\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT\n\n# Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs in previous years, the Supervisory Board comprehensively fulfilled its duties and obligations as laid out in the company's statutes and applicable law in the financial year 2023. It monitored the activities of the company's Board of Management, addressed the succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and advised the Board of Management on business management issues.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the Supervisory Board held six meetings and adopted one written resolution. The meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December. The written resolution was adopted in October. All meetings were held as in-person meetings.\n\nAt all meetings held in the financial year under review, the Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about the development of business at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. In particular, the Board of Management presented the development of Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management provided comprehensive information about the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including the planning as well as deviations of actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the Board of Management also regularly discussed the adequacy of capitalization, the solvency ratio of Allianz SE and the Group, and the corresponding stress and risk scenarios with the Supervisory Board. The annual and consolidated financial statements, including the respective auditor's reports, the half-year report as well as quarterly earnings releases were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the first half of 2023 in particular, the meetings again focused on the review of the Structured Alpha matter in close dialogue with the Board of Management, assisted by the law firm mandated by the Supervisory Board. The reports and deliberations also focused on the impact of rising inflation rates and interest rates on the overall economy and the insurance sector as well as a range of strategic topics, including the risk strategy and IT strategy, and the Board of Management's planning for the financial year 2024. The status of the digital implementation of the Allianz Customer Model by means of the Allianz Business Master Platform and the merger of the global MidCorp business with the business of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial was reported on at several meetings. Another regular item discussed was cyber risk security. The Supervisory Board also dealt extensively with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The deliberations of the Supervisory Board and in particular the Personnel Committee and Sustainability Committee also included establishing target achievement and setting targets for the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received regular, timely and comprehensive reports from the Board of Management. The Board of Management's oral reports at the meetings were prepared with written documents, sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in good time before the relevant meeting. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board in writing about important events, including between meetings. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management held regular discussions about key developments and decisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board held separate talks with each member of the Board of Management on each individual's status of target achievement, both for the respective half year and the full year.\n\nOnce again in 2023, individual and group training sessions were implemented on the basis of a development plan adopted for the further training of the members of the Supervisory Board, for example on the topics of cybersecurity, the sales strategy, and the auditing of financial statements.\n\nAt the meeting on 16 February 2023, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with the preliminary business figures for the financial year 2022 and the Board of Management's dividend proposal. The appointed audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC), Frankfurt am Main, reported in detail on the preliminary results of its audit. In the further course of the meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed the status of the measures taken to implement results from the audit carried out by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regarding the Group steering processes and the System of Governance. Comprehensive discussions were also held on the status of implementation of the actions adopted by the Board of Management following the Structured Alpha matter. The Supervisory Board also obtained a detailed report on the status of the investigations carried out by the external lawyers into the question of potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in connection with the Structured Alpha matter. The Board of Management also reported on PIMCO's Asset Management business, focusing in particular on governance topics. The Supervisory Board also discussed the target achievement of the individual members of the Board of Management and, on that basis, set their variable remuneration for the financial year 2022, subject to the approval of the annual financial statements. In this context, the Supervisory Board decided to make use of its discretion to take unforeseeable extraordinary developments into account in determining target achievement and to use the net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted for the effects of Allianz's divestment in Russia, as the basis for target achievement. Against the backdrop of the Structured Alpha matter, the Supervisory Board once more also discussed the question of the applicability of the so-called compliance caveat in paying variable remuneration components to members of the Board of Management. The independent investigations of potential breaches of duty by members of the Board of Management had already concluded in December 2022 that there were no indications of misconduct by any members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Hence there was no reason to apply the compliance caveat. As part of the performance assessment, the Supervisory Board carried out a fit and proper assessment of the \n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nmembers of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board also dealt with succession planning for the Supervisory Board. At the end of the meeting, the Supervisory Board held an executive session without the Board of Management members being present and discussed questions relating to succession planning for the Board of Management as well as the talks of the Supervisory Board Chairman with investors and proxy advisors.\n\nAt the meeting on 2 March 2023, the Board of Management first reported on the business developments to that date in the financial year 2023. The Board of Management also presented its report on the development of risks and solvency in the financial year 2022 and the outlook for 2023.

The Supervisory Board then discussed the audited annual and consolidated financial statements and the Management and Group Management Report, including the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, the solvency statements for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the Board of Management's recommendation for the appropriation of earnings. The auditor confirmed that there had been no discrepancies since their February report and issued an unqualified auditor's report for the individual and consolidated financial statements and for the solvency statements. The auditor did not have any reservations, either, regarding the audit of the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, which partly went beyond legal requirements. The Supervisory Board then approved the audited annual and consolidated financial statements. It approved the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of earnings for the financial year 2022, the Remuneration Report and the Supervisory Board Report, the Corporate Governance Statement, and the Non-Financial Statement. Furthermore, the Board of Management reported on the status of investigations into potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in relation to the Structured Alpha matter. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved, at the recommendation of the Audit Committee, to propose to the Annual General Meeting the election of PwC as auditor for the 2023 individual and consolidated financial statements and for the review of the half-year financial report for 2023, and to mandate PwC with the supplementary audit of the Remuneration Report and the Non-Financial Statement for the financial year 2023. Moreover, the Supervisory Board reviewed the agenda and proposals for resolution for Allianz SE's 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and approved the stipulations of the Board of Management for the virtual AGM.

The Supervisory Board also dealt with BaFin's findings from the review of the implementation of the insurance supervisory law requirements for IT and the measures initiated by the Board of Management in response to these findings. Furthermore, given the substantial progress in implementing the measures initiated following the Structured Alpha matter, and at the recommendation of the lawyers mandated by the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board decided to dissolve the Audit Committee working group specifically set up for this purpose in 2021 and to return to regular reporting. In addition, the Supervisory Board obtained a comprehensive report on the status of the merger of the global MidCorp business with the business of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial.

In view of the particular importance of the latter topic for the Allianz Group's business activities, also with regard to aspects of data ethics, the members of the Technology Committee also participated in the discussion of this topic at the relevant meeting.\n\nThe Supervisory Board obtained regular and comprehensive information on the work performed by the committees.\n\n### **Overview of members' participation in Supervisory Board and committee meetings in the financial year 2023**\n\n#### **Individualized publication of members' participation in meetings**\n\n|                                           | Presence | %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----|\n| Plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board |          |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)               | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg (Vice Chairwoman) | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer (Vice Chairman )           | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                           | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                           | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Rashmy Chatterjee                         | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner                    | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goaër                      | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Martina Grundler                          | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                              | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Jürgen Lawrenz                            | 6/6      | 100 |\n| Primiano Di Paolo                         | 6/6      | 100 |\n\n|                                   | Presence | %   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-----|\n| Standing Committee                |          |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goaër              | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer                    | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Jürgen Lawrenz                    | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Personnel Committee               |          |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer                    | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Audit Committee                   |          |     |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner (Chairman) | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goaër              | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Martina Grundler                  | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Risk Committee                    |          |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                   | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                      | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Primiano Di Paolo                 | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Technology Committee              |          |     |\n| Rashmy Chatterjee (Chairwoman)    | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Jürgen Lawrenz                    | 2/2      | 100 |\n| Nomination Committee              |          |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                   | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 5/5      | 100 |\n| Sustainability Committee          |          |     |\n| Christine Bosse (Chairwoman)      | 4/4      | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 3/4      | 75  |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 4/4      | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 4/4      | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                      | 3/4      | 75  |\n\nUpon a proposal submitted by the Supervisory Board, the company's Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2023 appointed PwC as auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as the review of the half-year Financial Report 2023. PwC audited the financial statements of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective management reports and issued an unqualified auditor's report in each case. The management reports each also contain the Non-Financial Statement. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-year Financial Report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the solvency statements according to Solvency II as of 31 December 2023 for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. Furthermore, PwC was commissioned to conduct an audit of the contents of the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members received the documentation relating to the annual financial statements and the audit reports from PwC in due time. The preliminary financial statements and PwC's preliminary audit results were discussed in the Audit Committee on 21 February 2024, as well as in the Supervisory Board's plenary session on 22 February 2024. The finalized financial statements and PwC's audit reports (dated 26 February 2024) were reviewed by the Audit Committee on 5 March 2024 and discussed in the Supervisory Board plenary session on 6 March 2024. The auditors participated in the discussions and presented the results of their audit. Particular emphasis was placed on the key audit matters described in the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the solvency statements dated 31 December 2023 for both Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the related reports by PwC, were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the basis of its own reviews of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the management and Group management reports, and the recommendation for the appropriation of earnings, the Supervisory Board has not raised any objections and agreed with the results of PwC's audit. It approved the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements have thus been formally adopted. The Supervisory Board agrees with the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of earnings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to express its special thanks to all Allianz Group employees for their great personal commitment over the past financial year.\n\nThere were no changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board in the financial year 2023.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2024, Claire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre was appointed as a member of the Board of Management. She succeeds Giulio Terzariol, who resigned from office as of 31 December 2023.\n\nMunich, 6 March 2024\n\nFor the Supervisory Board:\n\n.

According to §317(2) sentence 6 HGB, the audit of the disclosures is limited to whether the relevant disclosures have been made.\n\n# Corporate Constitution of the European Company (SE)\n\nAs a European company, Allianz SE is subject to special European SE regulations and the German SE Implementation Act (\"SE-Ausführungsgesetz – SEAG\") and the German Act on the Involvement of Employees in a European Company (\"SE-Beteiligungsgesetz – SEBG\"), in addition to German Stock Corporation Law. Notwithstanding, key features of a German stock corporation – in particular the two-tier board system (Board of Management and Supervisory Board) and the principle of equal employee representation on the Supervisory Board – have been maintained by Allianz SE. The Corporate Constitution of Allianz SE is laid down in its Statutes. The current version of the Statutes is available on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance/statutes.html)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance/statutes.html)**.\n\n# Regulatory requirements\n\nThe regulatory requirements for corporate governance (System of Governance) applicable for insurance companies, insurance groups, and financial conglomerates apply. In particular, they include the establishment and further design of significant control functions (independent risk control function, actuarial function, compliance function, and internal audit) as well as general principles for an effective and proper business organization. These regulatory requirements are applicable throughout the Group in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The implementation of the regulatory requirements is supported by written guidelines issued by the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Furthermore, Solvency II requires the publication of qualitative and quantitative information, including a solvency statement. Details on the implementation of the regulatory requirements for corporate governance by Allianz SE and by the Allianz Group can be found in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report of Allianz SE and of the Allianz Group, which are published on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/results-reports/sfcr.html)**.\n\n# Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nGood corporate governance is essential for sustainable business performance. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE therefore attach great importance to complying with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (hereinafter \"Code\"), as amended from time to time. There are no statutory provisions on the basis of which recommendations of the Code are not applicable to Allianz SE. On 14 December 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued the following Declaration of Conformity of Allianz SE with the Code:\n\n#### **Declaration of Conformity in accordance with § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act**\n\nDeclaration of Conformity with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in accordance with §161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nSince issuing the last Declaration of Conformity on 15 December 2022, Allianz SE has complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission in the version of 28 April 2022, and will comply with the recommendations in the future.\n\nMunich, 14 December 2023 Allianz SE\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Management: Signed Oliver Bäte Signed Giulio Terzariol\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board: Signed Michael Diekmann\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE follows all suggestions of the Code in its version of 28 April 2022.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity and further information on corporate governance at Allianz is available on the **[Allianz company](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance.html)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance.html)**.\n\n# Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for setting business objectives and the strategic direction, for coordinating and supervising the operating entities, and for implementing and overseeing an appropriate and effective control and risk management system. The Board of Management also prepares the annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, the respective solvency statements, and the interim reports.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE currently has nine members. As a general rule, its members may not be older than 62. Further information on the members of the Board of Management can be found i[n Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.](#page-12-0) The composition is also available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/board-of-management.html)**, which also provides the CVs of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are jointly responsible for the management of the company and compliance with legal requirements. Notwithstanding this overall responsibility, the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nDivisional responsibilities for business segments and/or functional responsibilities are assigned to the individual departments. The latter include, inter alia, Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Mergers & Acquisitions. Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities.\n\nThe meetings of the Board of Management are convened and chaired by the Chairperson. In addition, any member of the Board may request a meeting, stating the proposed subject of discussion. As a rule, a meeting of the Board of Management was held every two weeks in the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Board of Management has a quorum if all members of the Board of Management have been invited to a meeting and at least half its members – including the Chairperson or a member of the Board of Management appointed by him – attend the meeting. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, the full Board of Management takes decisions with a simple majority of participating members. In the event of a tie, the Chairperson of the Board of Management has the deciding vote.

This comprises broad diversity with regard to gender, internationality, and educational as well as professional background.\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the achievement of such target, inter alia, on the basis of the following specific indicators:\n\n- − adequate proportion of women on the Management Board;\n- − adequate share of members with an international background (e.g., based on origin or extensive professional experience abroad), ideally with connection to the regions in which the Allianz Group is operating;\n- − adequate diversity with regard to educational and professional background, taking into account the limitations for the Supervisory Board by regulatory requirements (fitness).\n\nThis diversity concept is implemented via the appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management by the Supervisory Board. For the purpose of long-term succession planning, a list of candidates is prepared and updated on an ongoing basis by the Chairperson of the Board of Management in consultation with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. It is ensured that lists of successors will comprise appropriate percentages of candidates with international experience. This is especially taken into account by the Personnel Committee in succession planning. The list of candidates includes internal and external candidates generally meeting the requirements for a mandate in the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Management, the Personnel Committee, after a thorough examination, recommends a suitable candidate to the Supervisory Board plenary session. It also reports on the selection process and, if necessary, alternative candidates. Prior to an appointment to the Board of Management, all members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nCurrently, the Board of Management of Allianz SE comprises four female members, accounting for 44.4 %. Four members of the Board of Management have international backgrounds based on their origin. There is an adequate degree of diversity with regard to educational and professional backgrounds. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is thus composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has adopted a clear and comprehensible system for the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management remuneration system must be submitted to the General Meeting for approval whenever a material amendment is planned to be effected, but at least every four years. The most recent submission of the remuneration system for the Board of Management of Allianz SE to the General Meeting for approval was on 5 May 2021.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board must prepare a clear and comprehensible annual report on the remuneration of current and former Board members, which must be submitted to the General Meeting for approval each year.\n\nThe current remuneration system for the Board of Management and the Remuneration Report, including the auditor's report, are available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/remuneration.html)**.\n\nThe Board of Management reports regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board on business development, the company's net assets, financial position and earnings, planning and achievement of objectives, business strategy, and risk exposure. Details on the Board of Management's reporting to the Supervisory Board are laid down in the information rules issued by the Supervisory Board.\n\nImportant decisions of the Board of Management require approval by the Supervisory Board. Approval requirements are stipulated by law, by the Statutes, or in individual cases by decisions of the General Meeting. Supervisory Board approval is required, for example, for certain capital measures, intercompany agreements, and the launch of new business segments or the closure of existing ones. Approval is also required for acquisitions of companies and holdings in companies as well as for divestments of Group companies that exceed certain thresholds. Moreover, the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE in the version dated June 2021 (hereinafter \"SE Agreement\") requires the approval of the Supervisory Board for the appointment of the member of the Board of Management responsible for labor and social affairs.\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible for appointing the members of the Board of Management, determining their overall remuneration, succession planning for the Board of Management, and reviewing Allianz SE's and the Allianz Group's annual financial statements. The Supervisory Board's activities in the financial year 2023, including an individualized disclosure of the meeting participation, are described in th[e Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0)\n\nThe German Co-Determination Act (\"Mitbestimmungsgesetz\") does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is determined by general European SE regulations. These regulations are implemented in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the General Meeting. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE Works Council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement, which stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office includes four employee representatives from Germany – including one trade union representative – and one each from France and Italy. According to §17(2) SEAG, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall comprise at least 30% women and at least 30% men. The regular term of appointment for the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is four years. Moreover, a staggered board with different appointment periods was introduced with the elections to the Supervisory Board on 4 May 2022.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board is presented in the [Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0) Further information on the Supervisory Board members is presented in [Mandates of the Members of the](#page-12-0)  [Board of Management.](#page-12-0) Furthermore, the composition and a general description of the operations of the Supervisory Board are available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html)**, which also provides the CVs of the Supervisory Board members.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes all decisions with a simple majority. The special requirements for appointing members to the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee, do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who – at Allianz SE – must be a shareholder representative. If there is a tie and the Chairperson is not present, the casting vote lies with the vice chairperson elected at the shareholder representatives' proposal. A second vice chairperson is elected at the employee representatives' proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities and the activities of its committees in the framework of a so-called self-assessment. The self-assessment is carried out either by means of an internal questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant. In 2023, the self-assessment was carried out using an internal questionnaire. The Supervisory Board plenary session discusses recommendations for improvements and adopts appropriate measures on the basis of recommendations from the Standing Committee. In addition, the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Supervisory Board are reviewed as part of an annual self-evaluation required by supervisory law, and a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on this basis. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee also hold regular sessions that are not attended by any of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nPart of the Supervisory Board's work is carried out by its committees. The Supervisory Board receives regular reports on the activities of its committees. The composition of committees and the tasks assigned to them are governed by the Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure, which can be found on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html)**.\n\n### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\n| Supervisory Board committees

2023, the following Group committees were The objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board (in the version of September 2022), as specified to implement legal requirements and the recommendation of the Code, are set out below. drawn up under the Code, the diversity concept is also included. The objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board can be found on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html)**.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Objectives for the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board**\n\n\"The aim of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board is to have members who are equipped with the necessary skills and competence to properly supervise and advise Allianz SE's management. Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations. These objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (\"GCGC\"). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise (\"Kompetenzprofil\") as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\nI. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n#### 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety. Therefore, no personal circumstances shall exist which – according to general experience – lead to the assumption that the diligent and orderly exercise of the mandate may be affected (in particular, administrative offenses or violation of criminal law, especially in connection with commercial activity).\n\n#### 2. Fitness\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must have the expertise and experience necessary for a diligent and autonomous exercise of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board mandate, in particular for exercising control of and giving advice to the Management Board as well as for the active support of the development of the company. This comprises in particular:\n\n- adequate expertise in all business areas,\n- adequate expertise in the insurance and finance sector or comparable relevant experience and expertise in other sectors,\n- adequate expertise in the regulatory provisions material for Allianz SE (supervisory law,\n- including Solvency II regulation, corporate and capital markets law, corporate governance), – ability to assess the business risks,\n- knowledge of accounting basics and insurance specific risk management basics.\n\n#### 3. Independence\n\nThe GCGC defines a person as independent who, in particular, does not have any business or personal relations with Allianz SE or its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or an enterprise associated with the latter, which may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE states the following with regard to the further specification of independence:\n\n- Former members of the Allianz SE Management Board shall not be deemed independent during the mandatory corporate law cooling-off period.\n- Members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in office for more than 12 years shall not be deemed independent.\n- Regarding employee representatives, the mere fact of employee representation and the existence of a working relationship with the company shall not itself affect the independence of the employee representatives.\n\nApplying such definition, at least eight members of the Supervisory Board shall be independent. In case shareholder representatives and employee representatives are viewed separately, at least four of each should be independent.\n\nIt has to be considered that the possible emergence of conflicts of interests in individual cases cannot generally be excluded.

As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, the potential to influence the selection of employee representatives is limited.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept:\n\nAccording to the assessment of the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives – i.e., Ms. Boissard, Ms. Bosse, Ms. Chatterjee as well as Mr. Diekmann, Dr. Eichiner and Mr. Hainer – are independent within the meaning of the objectives (see No. I.3).\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee as a whole are familiar with the sector in which the company operates. All shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee, including the Chairperson of the Committee, have comprehensive expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Audit Committee, Dr. Eichiner, is a business administration graduate. He gained extensive knowledge and experience in both accounting and auditing during his many years as Chief Financial Officer of a DAX-listed company. Ms. Boissard also acquired extensive knowledge and experience in both of these areas during her many years as a member of the Audit Committee and as part of her role as CEO of Korian S.A.. Finally, Mr. Diekmann also has in-depth knowledge and experience in both areas due to his many years of service first as CEO and later as Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and long-standing member of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nThe employee representatives on the Audit Committee, Ms. Grundler and Mr. Le Goaër, also have expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing due to their long-standing membership of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nWith five female and seven male Supervisory Board members, the gender ratio of 30 % required under the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions is met. In addition, the Supervisory Board has five members with international backgrounds.\n\nThe skills profile is also met by the Supervisory Board as a whole. Based on the objectives for its composition, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has developed the following qualification matrix.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board of Allianz SE: Qualification matrix**\n\n|                             |                                          | Diekmann | Hainer | Boissard | Bosse  | Chatterjee  | Eichiner | Burkhardt-Berg | Le Goaër | Grundler | Kirsch | Lawrenz | Di Paolo |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|\n| Tenure                      | Joined Board in                          | 2017     | 2017   | 2017     | 2012   | 2022        | 2016     | 2012           | 2018     | 2016     | 2018   | 2015    | 2022     |\n| Personal<br>Appropriateness | Regulatory Requirement<br>(Fit & Proper) | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Independence1                            | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | No Overboarding1                         | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n| Diversity                   | Gender                                   | male     | male   | female   | female | female      | male     | female         | male     | female   | male   | male    | male     |\n|                             | Nationality                              | German   | German | French   | Danish | Singaporean | German   | German         | French   | German   | German | German  | Italian  |\n| Expertise                   | Accounting                               | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Insurance Actuarial<br>Practice          | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Investment<br>Management                 | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Technology                               | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Digital Transformation                   | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Employee Engagement                      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Sustainability                           | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n| Regional<br>Expertise       | North America                            | ✓        | ✓      | -        | -      | ✓           | ✓        | -              | -        | -        | -      | -       | -        |\n|                             | Growth Markets                           | ✓        | ✓      | -        | -      | ✓           | ✓        | -              | -        | -        | -      | -       | -        |\n|                             | Europe (E.U.)                            | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n\n✓ Criteria met. Expertise criteria based on annual self-evaluation by the Supervisory Board. Tick means at least \"Good knowledge\" and implies the capacity to understand the relevant matters well, and to take educated decisions. Good knowledge may result from existing qualifications and from the training regularly attended by all members of the Supervisory Board. On a scale from A-E this requires at least grade B.\n\n1\\_According to the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe remuneration of the Supervisory Board is laid down in the Statutes of Allianz SE. The most recent resolution on Supervisory Board remuneration was passed at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023. The corresponding resolution of the Annual General Meeting and the Remuneration Report, including the auditor's report, are available at the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/remuneration.html)**.\n\n## General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the General Meeting. The General Meeting elects the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board and decides on the approval of the actions taken by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. It decides, in particular, on the appropriation of net earnings, capital measures, the election of the auditor, and approval of intercompany agreements. It also decides on the approval of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management presented by the Supervisory Board, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, the approval of the Remuneration Report prepared by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as changes to the Company's Statutes. Resolutions of the General Meeting shall be passed, unless mandatory legal provisionsrequire otherwise, by a simple majority of the votes cast. In accordance with European regulations and the Statutes, amendmentsto the Statutesrequire at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast if less than half of the share capital is represented at the General Meeting. In addition, such resolutions require the simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution, unless higher thresholds are stipulated by law. When adopting resolutions, each share confers one vote.\n\nEach year, an Annual General Meeting is held, at which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board give an account of the preceding financial year. For special circumstances, the German Stock Corporation Act provides for the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting. If authorized by the Statutes, general meetings can also be held in virtual format.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nThe AllianzGroup has an appropriate and effective internal control system for reviewing and monitoring its operating activities and business processes, in particular financial reporting, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential, not only for the resilience and value of the company, but also to retain the confidence of the capital market, our customers, and the public. An assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization.\n\nIn addition, the Allianz Group has implemented an appropriate and effective framework and measures to identify, assess, manage, and communicate risks. For further information on the internal control system and risk management system of Allianz, please refer to th[e Risk](#page-129-0)  [and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and underpins the trust of our customers, shareholders, business partners, and employees. The Compliance function fosters a corporate culture of individual and collective responsibility for ethical conduct and adherence to the rules. For further information on the compliance management system of Allianz, please refer to the [Non-Financial](#page-55-0)  [Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nOur Code of Conduct and the internal compliance policies and guidelines derived from it provide all employees, managers, and executive board members with clear and practical guidance, enabling them to act in line with the values of the Allianz Group. The rules of conduct established by the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees worldwide and form the basis for our compliance programs. The Code of Conduct is available on the **[Allianz company](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance.html)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance.html)**.\n\n## Directors' Dealings\n\nMembers of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as persons closely associated with them, are obliged by the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation to notify both Allianz SE and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of any transactions carried out by them involving shares or debt securities of Allianz SE or related financial derivatives or other related financial instruments as soon as the value of the acquisition or disposal transactions by the member reaches or exceeds € 20 thou in total within a calendar year. These disclosures are published on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/announcements/directors-dealings.html)**.\n\n# Accounting and auditing\n\nThe Allianz Group prepares its accounts according to §315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE are prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards.\n\nThe auditor of the annual financial statements and the auditor in charge of the review of the half-yearly financial report were elected by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023. The audit of the financial statements covers the individual financial statements of Allianz SE and the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group. In addition, the auditor audits the (Group) Management Report, including the Non-Financial Statement. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the solvency statements are also audited by the auditor, who also has to audit the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 were also subjected to a substantive audit by the auditor, in addition to the statutory audit scope.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe inform our shareholders, financial analysts, the media, and the general public about the Company's situation on a regular basis and in a timely manner. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, and the respective Management Reports are made publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided in the Allianz Group's half-yearly financial reports and quarterly statements. Information is also made available at the Annual General Meeting, at conference calls for analysts and journalists, and on the corporate website. The **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/conferences-presentations/financial-calendar.html)** also provides a financial calendar listing the dates of major publications and events, such as annual reports, half-yearly financial reports, quarterly statements, Annual General Meetings, and analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\n# Information in accordance with the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sectors\n\nThe section below outlines the targets set for Allianz SE and the other companies of the Allianz Group in Germany that are subject to codetermination (the \"subsidiaries concerned\") for the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nPursuant to §17(2) SEAG, the share of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has to be at least 30% each. The Supervisory Board fulfills this requirement as it includes five women (41.7%) and seven men (58.3%).\n\nPursuant to §16(2) SEAG, it has to be ensured that the Board of Management includes at least one female and at least one male member when appointing members to the Board of Management. This statutory requirement is met by the current Board of Management of Allianz SE. As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women on the Board of Management was 33.3%. Since 1 January 2024, the proportion of women on the Board of Management has been 44.4%.\n\nWith regard to the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management has set targets of 30% for each, to be met by 31 December 2024. As at 31 December 2023, this target was already met for the first management level with a percentage of women of 34.2%, but was not yet met for the second level with a percentage of 28.6%.\n\nWith regard to the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for nine of those eleven subsidiaries were set at 33%, the target quota for one subsidiary concerned was set at 35%, and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned was set at 50% for 31 December 2024. Eight of the eleven subsidiaries reached this target ahead of the due date as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe target quotas for the respective Boards of Management of the subsidiaries concerned were between 25% and 50% (35.7% on average) for 31 December 2024 and were already met by eight of the eleven companies as of 31 December 2023. For the subsidiaries concerned, the respective Boards of Management have set target quotas of 30% to 40% (32.9% on average) for 31 December 2024 for the first management level and target quotas of 30% to 43.5% (39.2% on average) for the second management level below the Board of Management. Due to internal restructurings, one of the eleven subsidiaries no longer has any employees below the level of the Board of Management. Therefore, reference will only be made to ten subsidiaries in the following paragraph.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the targets were met by four of the ten subsidiaries concerned for the first management level, while two of the ten companies met the target set for the second management level ahead of the due date. Despite increased efforts to promote women in the Allianz Group and in the individual subsidiaries, it was not possible to reach the targets ahead of the due date in the other cases as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for all vacant positions. Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>TAKEOVER-RELATED STATEMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to §289a and §315a of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB\") and § 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act (\"Aktiengesetz – AktG\").\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the share capital of Allianz SE was € 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 391,718,983 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval duly applied for may only be withheld if it is deemed necessary in the company's interest on exceptional grounds. The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up period. During the lock-up period, employees can exercise their voting rights.\n\nAllianz SE is not aware of any direct or indirect interests in the share capital that exceed 10% of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of Allianz SE's Board of Management is governed by Articles 9 (1), 39 (2) and 46 of the SE Regulation, §§84, 85 AktG, §24 (3) and §47 No. 1 of the German Insurance Supervision Act (\"Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – VAG\"), and the Statutes. According to the Statutes, the Board of Management shall consist of at least two persons; the Supervisory Board determines the number of any additional members (§5 (1) of the Statutes). The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to five years; reappointment is permitted for a maximum of five years in each case (§5 (3) of the Statutes). A simple majority of the votes cast in the Supervisory Board is required to appoint members to the Board of Management. In the case of a tie vote, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who pursuant to Article 42 of the SE Regulation must be a shareholder representative, shall have the casting vote (§8 (3) of the Statutes). If the Chairperson does not participate in the vote, the Vice-Chairperson shall have the casting vote, provided they are a shareholder representative. A Vice-Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (§8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments to the Statutes are governed by Article 59 SE Regulation, §179 AktG, and the Statutes. §13 (4) of the Statutes of Allianz SE stipulates that, unless mandatory law requires otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (§179 (1) AktG and §10 of the Statutes).\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may increase the company's share capital on or before 3 May 2027, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new registered no-par value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- − Up to a total of € 467,968,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/I): In case of a capital increase against cash contribution, the Board of Management may exclude the shareholders' subscription rights for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, including mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10%, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the stock market price. The Board of Management may furthermore exclude the shareholders' subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- − Up to a total of € 15,000,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/II): The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. New shares may only be issued to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies.\n\nThe company's share capital is conditionally increased by up to € 116,992,000 (Conditional Capital 2022). This conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participation rights, participation rights, and subordinated financial instruments issued against cash by Allianz SE or its subsidiaries, based on the authorizations granted by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, exercise their conversion or option rights, or to the extent that conversion obligations from such bonds are fulfilled, and to such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, the Board of Management may, until 3 May 2025, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10% of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (§71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under §§71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5% of the share capital.\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- − Our reinsurance contracts, in principle, include a clause under which both parties to the contract have an extraordinary termination right if and when the counterparty merges with another entity or its ownership or control situation changes materially. Agreements with brokers regarding services connected with the purchase of reinsurance cover also provide for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- − Allianz SE is also party to various bancassurance distribution agreements for insurance products in various regions. These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties have an extraordinary termination right in the event of a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.\n- − Shareholder agreements and joint ventures to which Allianz SE is a party often contain change-of-control clauses that provide, as the case may be, for the termination of the agreement, or for put or call rights that one party can exercise with regard to the joint venture or the target company, if there is a change of control of the other party.\n- − The framework agreements between Allianz SE and the subsidiaries of various car manufacturers relating to the distribution of car insurance by the respective car manufacturers each include a clause under which each party has an extraordinary termination right in case there is a change of control of the other party.\n- − In some cases, bilateral credit agreements provide for termination rights in the event of a change of control, mostly defined as the acquisition of at least 30% of the voting rights within the meaning of §29 (2) of the German Takeover Act (\"Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz – WpÜG\"). Where such termination rights are exercised, the respective credit lines have to be replaced by new credit lines under conditions then applicable.\n- − Allianz Group sponsoring and similar partnership agreements may provide for termination rights for the other party where there is a change of control in relation to Allianz SE. These termination rights are largely discretionary.\n- − Under the Allianz Equity Incentive Program, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) – i.e., virtual Allianz shares – are granted to senior management of the Allianz Group worldwide as a stock-based remuneration component. The conditions for these RSUs contain change-of-control clauses, which apply when a majority of the voting share capital in Allianz SE is directly or indirectly acquired by one or more third parties who do not belong to the Allianz Group, and which provide for an exception from the usual vesting and exercise periods. In line with the relevant general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for the non-application of the vesting period in the event of a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions influencing the share price are substantially different when there is a change of control.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe Remuneration Report describes the structure and arrangements of the remuneration system for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE. It explains the application of the remuneration system in the 2023 financial year, using detailed and individualized specifications on the remuneration of current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe report was jointly created by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, taking into consideration the requirements of §162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version.\n\nIt was also decided to allow the auditor to carry out a comprehensive, content audit of the Remuneration Report going above and beyond the legal requirements of §162 (3) AktG.\n\n# The remuneration year of 2023 at a glance\n\n### **The economic and geopolitical environment**\n\nIn the first half of the year in particular, 2023 was characterized by the continued dynamic inflation trend in many leading economies. Only in the second half of the year was a slow normalization of inflation rates achieved thanks to rapid interest rate hikes by central banks. The economic impact of high inflation and restrictive monetary policy was also evident on the international capital markets. In addition to high claims inflation, the insurance industry and asset management therefore also had to successfully navigate a very volatile investment environment. Natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria as well as thunderstorms in Germany, also posed major challenges for our industry in 2023. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East contributed to the challenging geopolitical and economic environment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee closely monitored business developments, particularly with regard to potential target achievement at Group level and individual remuneration targets at the half-year and year-end 2023. In addition to the financial targets, the non-financial targets and target achievement for 2023 were also discussed intensively, and changes to the Management Board were prepared and implemented.\n\n### **Group financial targets**\n\nThe annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI) allocation are based on two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50%.\n\nThe operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was exceeded to € 14.75 bn, as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Corporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 107.69% for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. In the Board's remuneration system, which will be submitted for approval by the 2025 Annual General Meeting, the Group's financial target of net income attributable to shareholders will be adjusted going forward by eliminating certain non-operating effects such as fluctuations from market movements.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100% target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00%.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85%.\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/16 description: The image contains two line graphs, one titled \"Operating profit\" and the other titled \"Net income attributable to shareholders\". The \"Operating profit\" graph shows the actual value for 2023 at 107.69%. The x-axis shows \"Floor\" at €7.1 bn, \"100% target\" at €14.2 bn, and \"Cap\" at €17.75 bn. The line graph increases from €7.1 bn to €14.75 bn, then plateaus. The \"Net income attributable to shareholders\" graph shows the actual value for 2023 at 100%. The x-axis shows \"Floor\" at €3.7 bn, \"100% target\" at €7.9-8.9 bn, and \"Cap\" at €11 bn. The line graph increases from €3.7 bn to €8.54 bn, then plateaus.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Board of Management performance in 2023**\n\nIn the financial year under review, the Board of Management faced unprecedented challenges requiring a team effort. In addition to the geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, the Board of Management had to meet supervisory requirements and adopt decisions to implement the digital future. These topics had to be jointly addressed by the entire Board of Management across the divisional areas of responsibility. The members of the Board of Management also successfully handled the additional tasks arising from the streamlining effected in the financial year under review. This applies in particular to the business activities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, Allianz X, and the implementation of IT verticalization and business model transformation.\n\nAs a result, the Board of Management achieved a record result in terms of operating profit and net income, despite a massive adverse impact resulting from natural disasters, high inflation, and rapidly rising interest rates. This strong overall performance was achieved on a sustainable basis: Customer satisfaction at Allianz once again reached top scores. The proportion of local business segments considered as market leaders in terms of customer satisfaction as measured by the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), for example, grew to 59%. Employee testimonials were also very positive. The Inclusive Meritocracy Index and Work Well Index Plus, which are used to measure employee satisfaction, rose to new record levels of 81% and 76%, respectively, bucking a negative trend in the industry. In addition, the Board of Management also met its ambitious environmental targets. Examples include CO2 emissions per employee, which were reduced by 62% versus the baseline year 2019 and were thus further reduced compared to the previous year (-57%) despite a normalization of travel behavior after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDue to the very good overall team performance of the Board of Management in all cross-divisional matters, for the first time the Supervisory Board unanimously decided to refrain from differentiating the individual contribution factor for the annual bonus for the 2023 financial year and to set a common factor of 1.15 for the regular Board members and to assess Mr. Bäte's performance in leading the Board of Management team with a factor of 1.17. Individual performance by the individual members of the Board of Management is described in detail below.\n\n### **Potential application of malus and clawback**\n\nIn the financial year, there was no reason to reduce the payment of variable remuneration (malus) or to reclaim variable remuneration already paid out (clawback).\n\n### **Approval of remuneration system and Remuneration Report**\n\nThe system for the remuneration of members of the Board of Management was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2021 with a majority vote of 87.14%. The remuneration system applies to all members of the Board of Management who were in office in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Remuneration Report for 2022 was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023 with a majority vote of 82.94%.\n\nOverall, the remuneration system and the Remuneration Report are strongly supported by investors and proxy advisors. In discussions with the Supervisory Board, it is emphasized, among other things, that the transparency provided with regard to Board of Management remuneration exceeds the best practice standard in Germany in many respects and that the Supervisory Board exercises its discretionary powers, as granted to them to the usual extent, very responsibly.\n\n### **Changes to the composition of the Board of Management**\n\nGiulio Terzariol was released from his mandate as a member of the Board of Management on 31 December 2023 so that he can pursue a career opportunity outside the company in his home country.\n\nClaire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre took over from Giulio Terzariol on 1 January 2024 and has been working with Mr. Terzariol on a seamless handover of his responsibilities.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\nRemuneration is designed to be appropriate compared to peer companies, given the Allianz Group's range of business activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the company that is in line with our corporate strategy. The key principles are as follows:\n\n- − Support of the Group's strategy: The design of variable compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects the business strategy and sustainable long-term development of the Allianz Group.\n- − Alignment of pay and performance: The performance-based variable component of the remuneration of members of the Board of Management forms a significant portion of the overall remuneration, corresponding to 70% of the target compensation.\n- − Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A major part of the variable remuneration reflects longer-term performance, with deferred payout (64%), and is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share price.\n\nThe Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee. If required, the Supervisory Board may seek outside advice from independent external consultants. The Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of Management members. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is generally not involved in discussion about their own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of the AktG in its currently valid version, as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nClarity and comprehensibility are ensured at all times. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation and regularly reviews the appropriateness of the remuneration. This is based on both a horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical comparison (in relation to Allianz employees). Again, the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\nThe structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n### **Horizontal appropriateness**\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE against other DAX companies and selected international companies (including, for example, the top positions in the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance), taking into account the company's position, and the Allianz Group's long-term performance, relative size, complexity, and internationality.\n\nAs part of the review in 2022 of the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Management, a need to adjust the level of remuneration for the Board members at Allianz SE was identified for 2023 and going forward. A comparison of Board of Management remuneration with the DAX 40 companies on the basis of turnover, number of employees and market capitalization shows that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Management Board and the ordinary members of the Management Board is below the comparative value. In addition, the reduction of the entire Board of Management to nine members and the associated redistribution of tasks led to an increase in the workload for the remaining Board members. For these reasons, the Supervisory Board deemed an increase in the annual target remuneration of 5% for all Board members to be appropriate. The exact amounts can be found in the graph relating to the overview of the structure of the target remuneration.\n\n### **Vertical appropriateness**\n\nThis comparison is based on the total direct remuneration of a member of the Board of Management and the average direct remuneration of an employee of the German Allianz companies. The Supervisory Board's decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this comparison for the previous financial year. For the 2022 financial year, the factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an employee was \"65\" and the factor for a regular Board member to an employee was \"37\". For the 2023 financial year, the respective factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an employee is \"68\" and the factor regular board member to employee is \"36\".\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following diagram provides an overview of the structure and amount of the target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/3 description: This image shows a breakdown of compensation components for CEO/BM in thousands of Euros. The total compensation is 100%, which amounts to 6,691 for CEO and 3,414 for BM. This is broken down into three main components: Base salary (30%), Annual bonus (25%), and Long-term incentive (LTI), deferred (45%). The base salary is 2,007 for CEO and 1,024 for BM and is a fixed amount. The annual bonus is 1,673 for CEO and 854 for BM and is determined by a target achievement factor (0-150%), which is a combination of group result (50% operating result, 50% net income) and individual contribution factor (0.8-1.2). The long-term incentive (LTI) is 3,011 for CEO and 1,536 for BM and is determined by an LTI payout factor (0-272%), which is a combination of target achievement factor annual bonus, 4-year share price development, relative performance factor (index comparison), and sustainability check (100% down to 0).\n\n| Shareholding<br>requirement                     | Shareholding requirement<br>• CEO: 2 x base salary<br>• BM: 1 x base salary<br>Total stock exposure, including<br>LTI at full run-rate:<br>• CEO: 8 x base salary<br>• BM: 7 x base salary |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pension provision<br>(pension<br>contributions) | • 15% of the target remuneration (50% of the base<br>salary)<br>• CEO: € 1,003 thou, BM: € 512 thou                                                                                        |\n| Severance payment                               | • Severance payment limit ≤ 2 x target remuneration<br>excluding pension contributions                                                                                                     |\n| Malus<br>Clawback                               | • Applicable to the entire variable remuneration:<br>• Malus: up to 100%<br>• Clawback: up to 3 years                                                                                      |\n| Cap                                             | • Remuneration cap including pension contributions<br>in € thou:<br>• CEO: € 11,750, BM: € 6,000                                                                                           |\n\nCEO = Chief Executive Officer, BM = regular Board member.\n\nConsideration of sustainability criteria.\n\n1\\_The cap of € 11,750 thou, or € 6,000 thou including pension contributions, limits the LTI effective payout to a maximum of 272% of the target allocation value.\n\n2\\_Review of target achievement for sustainability on the basis of financial, environmental, and social criteria.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Fixed remuneration**\n\nThe fixed remuneration components comprise the base salary, perquisites, and pension contributions. These components provide competitive remuneration to attract and retain Board of Management members with experience and skills that enable them to develop and successfully implement the Allianz Group's strategy. They secure a reasonable level of income in line with market conditions and promote a company management that is commensurate with risk.\n\n### **Base salary**\n\nThe base salary, which is not performance-related, is paid in twelve equal monthly installments.\n\n### **Perquisites**\n\nPerquisites mainly consist of contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and the provision of a company car and further individual perquisites if applicable. Perquisites are not linked to performance. Each member of the Board of Management is responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the level of perquisites; a contractual annual cap applies. If an appointment to the Board of Management requires a change of residence, relocation expenses are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.\n\n### **Pension contribution**\n\nTo provide competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\" are invested with a guarantee for the contributions paid but no further interest guarantee.\n\nEach year, the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is provided and, if so, to what extent. The current pension contribution generally represents 15% of the target remuneration of the Board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should Board membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management prior to 2015. Payments of social insurance contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also give rise to additional pension entitlements.\n\n### **Performance-based remuneration**\n\nThe performance-based variable remuneration includes the shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. This composition aims to balance short-term performance, longer-term success, and sustained value creation. The Supervisory Board ensures that the variable remuneration targets are challenging, sustainable, and ambitious.\n\n### **Annual bonus**\n\nThe annual bonus provides incentives for profitable growth and further development of the operating business by successfully implementing the business objectives for the respective financial year. In doing so, the overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities of the individual members of the Board of Management are taken into consideration.\n\nThe annual bonus is calculated by multiplying the target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus. It is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150% of the target amount.\n\n### **Long-term incentive – LTI**\n\nThe long-term, share-based remuneration is oriented mainly towards the sustainable increase in the enterprise value. Taking the share price performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nOther stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting strategic sustainability targets. The achievement of these targets forms the basis for the final assessment at the end of the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nAlmost two thirds (64%) of the variable remuneration is sharebased, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the company in the Board of Management remuneration.\n\n### **Additional remuneration principles**\n\n### **Shareholding obligation and shareholding exposure**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are obliged to build up the following degree of share ownership within three years:\n\n- − Chairperson of the Board of Management: two times base salary, i.e., € 4,013 thou,\n- − Regular Board of Management member: one time base salary, i.e., € 1,024 thou.\n\nOwnership is required for the entire term of service on the Board of Management. Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay component conversion. In the event of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The ownership obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to Allianz stock. This amounts to approximately 800% of base salary for the Chairperson and approximately 700% of base salary for a regular Board member.\n\n### **Malus/clawback**\n\nIn order to ensure sustainable corporate development and to avoid taking inappropriate risks, variable remuneration components may not be paid, or payment may be restricted, in the event of a significant breach of the Allianz Code of Conduct or regulatory Solvency II policies or standards, including risk limits.\n\nIn the same way, variable remuneration components already paid may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout. Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may be implemented if this is required by the supervisory authority (BaFin) in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n### **Payout cap**\n\nIn accordance with §87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nThus, the actual payout for the underlying financial year – comprising the base salary, variable remuneration and pension service cost – will be capped at maximum of € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management, and at € 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management. If the remuneration for the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable remuneration accordingly.\n\nThis payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the 2019 financial year. Given that the actual amount of the long-term variable remuneration paid out cannot be determined until after vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration Report for the 2024 financial year.\n\n#### **Deviation from the remuneration system**\n\nThe Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory requirements (§87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account both macroeconomic and company-related exceptional circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and profitability of the company. The deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee.\n\nParticular components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include the base salary, the annual bonus and the LTI, including their relationship to each other, their respective assessment bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement assessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should not exceed a period of four years. In a crisis situation, for example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new Board member with skills such as crisis management expertise, with a remuneration structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to deviate from the remuneration system.\n\n#### **Remuneration adjustment**\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary unforeseeable developments when determining the amount of the variable remuneration components. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases.\n\nConceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target remuneration of members of the Board of Management, insofar as this is appropriate to ensure that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board of Management or a regular member of the Board of Management is appropriate with regard to their duties and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the horizontal and vertical comparison of the Board of Management remuneration. The aim of this rule is to moderately adjust Board of Management remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and thus to avoid major salary increases.\n\nRather than being automatic, adjustment requires a justified decision by the Supervisory Board on a case-by-case basis. Such a moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself represent a significant change to the remuneration system. These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective Remuneration Report for the financial year.\n\n### **Termination of service**\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n#### **Severance payment cap**\n\nPayments for early termination to Board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the annual compensation, consisting of the last financial year's base salary and 100% of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is made on a prorata basis for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in the event of premature termination of service.\n\n#### **Transition payment**\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a transition payment after leaving the Board of Management. The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25% of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, this pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, the remittance of the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.\n\n### **Miscellaneous**\n\n#### **Internal and external Board appointments**\n\nWhen a member of the Board of Management simultaneously holds an appointment at another company within the Allianz Group or their joint ventures with outside partners, the full amount of the respective remuneration is transferred to Allianz SE.\n\nIn recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, Board members are also allowed to accept a limited number of nonexecutive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50% of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE.\n\nThe respective Board member will only retain the full remuneration for that position if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board classifies the appointment as a personal one *(ad personam)*. Any remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those organizations' annual reports; the level of remuneration will be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Target achievement factor to determine the variable remuneration**\n\nIn line with the overarching strategic objective \"simplicity wins\", the calculation of variable remuneration follows a simple system. The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50%. The resulting target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division and the performance of the individual Board member. If targets are not met, the variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150%.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram that outlines the calculation of a target achievement factor. On the left, within a blue border, it states: \"Target achievement factor (maximum 150%) to determine: annual bonus and LTI grant value\". On the right, within a light blue border, it details the calculation: \"Group financial targets\" are determined by adding \"Operating profit (50%)\" and \"Net income attributable to shareholders (50%)\". The result is then multiplied by the \"Individual contribution factor 0.8-1.2\".\n\n### **Group financial targets**\n\nThe Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to shareholders. Adjustments are only applied to acquisitions and disposals that account for more than 10% of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders, or that have a valueadding effect from a risk management perspective (e.g., portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nOperating profit highlights the underlying performance of ongoing core operations.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling interests (minorities). Furthermore, the net income forms the basis for the dividend payout, as well as for calculating the return on equity. Both key performance indicators (KPIs) are important steering parameters for the Allianz Group and therefore reflect the level of implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group's financial target achievement is limited to a maximum of 150% and can drop to zero.\n\nThe minimum, target, and maximum values for the Group financial targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board. These targets are documented for the respective next financial year and published ex-post in the Remuneration Report.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Individual contribution factor (ICF): 0.8 -

The ICF is based on an assessment by the Allianz SE Supervisory Board of performance, sustainability and strategic goals, based on KPIs reflecting the respective Board member's area of responsibility and their personal contribution.\n\n- − Strategic priority: An individual strategic priority will be set for every Board member at the beginning of each performance year, linked to a corresponding KPI and qualitatively assessed by the Supervisory Board. In addition, overarching strategic goals that apply to all Board members are set.\n- − Performance (business division targets): For Board members with business-related division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance is based on various indicators of profitability (e.g., operating profit and net income) and productivity (e.g., expense ratio) for the respective business division. For Board members with a functional focus, division-\n\nresponsibilities, and are qualitatively assessed.\n\n− Sustainability targets: Non-financial sustainability targets take into account customer satisfaction (e.g., digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), employee engagement (e.g., Allianz Engagement Survey), and leadership quality. The assessment of the individual leadership quality also includes a review of behavioral aspects, such as customer orientation, collaborative leadership, entrepreneurship, and trust (e.g., corporate social responsibility, integrity, diversity, and sustainability as measured by the greenhouse gas reduction of Allianz companies and by the development of a roadmap to reduce CO2 emissions in the context of capital allocation).\n\nspecific performance targets are determined based on their key Additional information, in particular regarding the annual sustainability targets for the Allianz SE Board of Management can be found in the [Non-Financial Statement](#page-55-0) for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram of the LTI (Long-Term Incentive) allocation process. It starts with the LTI allocation value, which is the LTI target multiplied by the annual bonus target achievement factor (maximum 150%). This leads to the grant of virtual shares, so-called Restricted Stock Units. The next step involves a 4-year Allianz share price development (factor, with maximum 200% at payout), which is combined with a 4-year Allianz relative performance vs. STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index (factor, with maximum 200% at payout). These two factors are then combined with a sustainability check (100% to 0%). Finally, the payout is determined by the current share price in March n+5, adjusted by the relative performance and the sustainability check. A timeline shows the performance year (n), with n+1 corresponding to March 2024 (Allocation LTI/RSU 2023/2024) and n+5 corresponding to March 2028 (Payout LTI/RSU 2023/2024).\n\n#### **Determining the individual contribution factor (ICF)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the ICF for each member of the Board of Management based on the fulfillment of the individual performance indicators. Most of the performance indicators are provided with quantitative criteria, and therefore offer a sufficiently concrete basis for the combined assessment.\n\nEach ICF category – strategic priority, performance, and sustainability – has a significant weighting, and all three categories are of equal importance and make an equal contribution to the overall assessment. However, the individual indicators are not weighted on a fixed percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis of a formulaic calculation. This allows the Supervisory Board to take appropriate consideration of the individual criteria and to react appropriately to changes in priorities during the year. In particular, significantly underperforming in one category should allow a low overall rating without being balanced out by the other indicators.\n\nSince performance is determined without a specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n### **Long-term incentive (LTI) design**\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders and reflects the sustainable implementation of the company's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n- − Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, known as restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount, divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n\t- − The LTI allocation amount is calculated by multiplying the LTI target amount by the annual bonus achievement factor, and capped at a maximum of 150% of the target level.\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>− The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual financial media conference [1](#page-33-0). As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on the relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, and the results of the sustainability assessment.\n\n− Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share (\"Allianz TSR\") and the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index (\"Index TSR\") between the start and end of the four-year\n\n1\\_For accounting purposes, the determination of the fair value of RSUs is based on an option pricing model, taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends. The value of the RSUs used for the board members' compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nperformance factor, which is calculated as follows:\n\n- − At the end of the contractual vesting period, the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in percentage points; the result is multiplied by \"2\" because the comparison with competitors and the market is critically important, so the outperformance/underperformance is given a twofold weighting.\n- − To determine the factor, 100 percentage points are added to the result. Example: 1 percentage point outperformance results in a relative performance factor of 102%; 1 percentage point underperformance results in a relative performance factor of 98%.\n\nIn order to avoid incentivizing excessive risk-taking, the relative TSR performance factor is limited: it can vary between zero (for underperformance of the index by -50 percentage points or lower) and 200% (for outperformance of the index by minimum +50 percentage points or higher).\n\ncontractual vesting period. The payout is based on the TSR – Sustainability assessment: Prior to the payout of each LTI tranche, the Personnel Committee makes a preliminary assessment before the Supervisory Board determines, whether there are any sustainability-related concerns regarding a full payout. If any concerns are identified, payment of the tranche may be cancelled in full or in part.\n\n#### The sustainability assessment covers:\n\n- − compliance breaches,\n- − balance sheet issues, such as reserve strength, solvency, indebtedness, and ratings,\n- − KPIs contained in the individual Board members' targets, such as dNPS, employee satisfaction, and climate targets.\n\nThe assessment is made by applying a comparable basis; i.e., any regulatory changes, changes in accounting regulations, or changes in calculation methods for the KPIs in question are taken into account.\n\n− Allianz share performance, payout, and cap: Following the end of the four-year contractual vesting period, the granted RSUs are settled in cash, based on the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective RSU plan vests, multiplied by the relative TSR performance factor, and adjusted by the sustainability assessment, if necessary. The relevant share price is capped at 200% of the grant price. Likewise, the relative TSR performance factor is capped at a maximum of 200%. Taking into account the overall compensation cap (€ 6,000 thou for a regular Board member and € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management), the LTI payout in relation to the LTI target – which deviates from the individual LTI component caps – is limited to 272%.\n\nOutstanding RSU holdings are forfeited should a Board member leave at their own request or be terminated for important cause.\n\n### **Illustrative examples:**\n\n#### **LTI payout: performance exceeds expectation (scenario 1)**\n\n|

financial targets and target achievement**\n\nThe degree of target achievement for the Group's financial targets is calculated as the simple average of the target achievement of the operating profit for the year and the net income attributable to shareholdersfor the year. The operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was exceeded to € 14.75 bn as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health,\n\nCorporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 107.69 % for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100 % target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn. Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00 %.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85 %.\n\n### **Group financial target achievement 2022 und 2023**\n\n| Group financial target achievement | Operating profit |        | Net income attributable to shareholders |           | Achievement level combined in % |        |\n|------------------------------------|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Financial year                     | 2022             | 2023   | 2022                                    | 2023      | 2022                            | 2023   |\n| Bonus curve                        |                  |        |                                         |           |                                 |        |\n| 0 % - Floor in € bn                | 6.70             | 7.10   | 3.60                                    | 3.70      |                                 |        |\n| 100 % - Target in € bn             | 13.40            | 14.20  | 7.20                                    | 7.9 - 8.9 |                                 |        |\n| 150 % - Max in € bn                | 16.75            | 17.75  | 9.00                                    | 11.00     |                                 |        |\n| Target achievement                 |                  |        |                                         |           | 105.35                          | 103.85 |\n| Achievement level in € bn1         | 14.16            | 14.75  | 7.17                                    | 8.54      |                                 |        |\n| Achievement level in %             | 111.40           | 107.69 | 99.29                                   | 100.00    |                                 |        |\n| Weight in %                        | 50.00            | 50.00  | 50.00                                   | 50.00     |                                 |        |\n|                                    |                  |        |                                         |           |                                 |        |\n\n1\\_The 2022 operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders shown in this table (and also in the following tables within the Remuneration Report) are as published in the Annual Report 2022 and have not been adjusted to reflect the application of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), which have been adopted as of 1 January 2023.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Individual performance indicators and application of the individual contribution factor**\n\n \n\nIn order to calculate the annual bonus, the target achievement level of the Group's financial targets is multiplied by the individual contribution factor (ICF).

In addition to the very good financial performance, his strong personal commitment also helped the company to again achieve top scores for brand value as well as customer and employee satisfaction, forming an excellent basis for the continued successful development of Allianz. With regard to the Capital Markets Day to be held in December 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see the formulation and implementation of the updated corporate strategy in the new financial year. Moreover, the initiatives launched to deliver further productivity gains in the core business and accelerate profitable customer growth are expected to be consistently pursued.\n\nSirma Boshnakova successfully drove the growth of the platform business ahead in the completed financial year: Apart from the continued strong development of Allianz Partners, Ms. Boshnakova successfully launched the Solvd claims service platform in several markets. The Allianz Direct direct insurance company also reported robust growth and was migrated to a new IT infrastructure. In addition, the conclusion of a partnership in the bancassurance channel in the Netherlands forms an important basis for further growth. Alongside the continued scaling of Solvd, the Supervisory Board expects Ms. Boshnakova's area of responsibility to deliver further improvement in profitability in 2024.\n\nBarbara Karuth-Zelle delivered significant progress in major technology projects, in particular the realignment of the Business Master Platform. She also achieved considerable enhancements of the stability of infrastructure services and user satisfaction with workplace services. Ms. Karuth-Zelle was also responsible for the implementation of important productivity and digitalization initiatives. In addition, Ms. Karuth-Zelle consistently improved the company's IT security and reinforced Group IT Governance by driving ambitious transformation projects forward. Also, the economic management of the IT budget progressed in the completed financial year. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see continued steady improvements, particularly with regard to the speed of implementation and profitability of the IT portfolio, as well as significant and visible productivity gains at Allianz Technology.\n\nKlaus-Peter Röhler delivered further productivity gains in the portfolio he manages by and drove important transformation projects forward within the Allianz Group. The significant improvement in customer satisfaction, for example in life insurance in Germany and Switzerland, is particularly noteworthy. Employee satisfaction also continued to improve year-on-year in almost all subsidiaries in Mr. Röhler's portfolio. The achievement of financial targets in Mr. Röhler's portfolio was adversely affected by losses from natural disasters, particularly in Germany. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see further efficiency gains through IT investments and the consistent further development of pricing and claims models in property insurance, particularly with regard to the mapping of natural events resulting from climate change.\n\nAs CFO, Giulio Terzariol once again contributed significantly to the company's very solid position in all key financial indicators. Despite an extremely challenging economic environment, he further strengthened the solvency ratio, achieved the confirmation of or even improvements in key credit ratings, and safeguarded Group liquidity. He was also instrumental in ensuring that the high inflation rate only had a moderate impact on the combined ratio in property insurance and the Group result. Mr. Terzariol also successfully implemented the integration of the control functions and strengthened Group Governance in the long term. After a career spanning 25 years at Allianz with assignments in various places including the U.S., Asia and at the Munich head office, Mr. Terzariol left the company at the end of the year at his own request. The Supervisory Board thanks Mr. Terzariol for his outstanding contributions to the sustainable success of Allianz and wishes him all the best for the future.\n\nGünther Thallinger once again achieved a solid investment result in a challenging capital market environment characterized by extreme interest rate increases in many economies. Moreover, Mr. Thallinger's consistent reallocation of the investment portfolio helped secure the company's strong positioning, even with regard to a potential continued increase in capital market volatility, as well as Group liquidity. Allianz's leading position in the area of sustainability was further expanded, in particular due to Mr. Thallinger's strong personal commitment in formulating and implementing the new, ambitious Net-Zero Plan. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see a consistent adjustment of the investment portfolio to the changing economic framework, taking account of capital market requirements, as well as further profitable growth in the health insurance business.\n\nChristopher Townsend again achieved strong results in the Commercial Lines business in the 2023 financial year, driven by a very gratifying performance delivered by both Allianz Commercial and Allianz Trade. The entities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, newly allocated to his area of responsibility, also delivered notably improved results. In addition, Mr. Townsend continued to drive the development of the global Commercial Lines business forward. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see sustained improvements in the results of Allianz UK and the realization of the financial targets and visible productivity gains from the globalization of the Commercial Lines business.\n\nRenate Wagner quickly adjusted to her new responsibility for the Asia-Pacific business in the completed financial year and achieved robust growth and solid profitability despite continued challenges in Australia. Moreover, Ms. Wagner's efforts relating to the workforce and culture at Allianz again delivered very good results. Examples include employee satisfaction, which reached a record level and the top score among Allianz's competitors in the completed financial year. Allianz once again won several awards to honor its success in the area of Diversity & Inclusion. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects further profitable growth in Asia and improved results in Australia. Furthermore, strategic HR planning will remain a top priority in times of shortages of skilled labor.\n\nAndreas Wimmer safeguarded the resilience of the Asset Management business segment and U.S. Life Insurance in a very challenging capital market environment. In Asset Management, he cushioned adverse market effects through disciplined cost management and achieved robust new business despite strong volatility. In addition to very good growth in U.S. Life Insurance, he also successfully drove an ambitious IT transformation forward. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see the expansion of business with alternative asset classes for third-party customers and the consistent continuation of the integration of the Life Insurance and Asset Management business segments in order to strengthen the resulting business opportunities and the capital efficiency of the Allianz Group.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Overview target achievement and variable remuneration for the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the amounts for annual payout and LTIallocation resulting from the target achievement of the financial year, as well as the target, minimum, and maximum amount of the variable compensation components.\n\n### **Target achievement and variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management for the financial year**\n\n|                                               |      |                                   | Target achievement |                                 |        |        | Annual bonus |        |        |        | LTI allocation1 |            |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|--|\n| Board member                                  |      | Group<br>financial<br>performance | ICF                | Target<br>achievement<br>factor | Target | Min    | Max          | Payout | Target | Min    | Max             | Allocation |  |\n| Active Board members in 2023                  |      | %                                 | 0.8-1.2            | %                               | € thou | € thou | € thou       | € thou | € thou | € thou | € thou          | € thou     |  |\n| Oliver Bäte                                   | 2023 | 103.85                            | 1.17               | 121.50                          | 1,673  | -

It includes the payments made in the financial year for base salary, perquisites, and other remuneration. For the variable remuneration, the components for performance fully rendered in the financial year are reported. This requirement is met where the applicable performance criteria are fulfilled and conditions subsequent and suspensive have been met or have ceased to exist. For the 2023 financial year, this is the annual bonus that refers to the 2023 performance period and is paid out in March 2024. For the sharebased renumeration, the payout of the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) RSU allocated in 2019 for the 2018 financial year, which vested in the 2023 financial year, is reported.\n\nThe additional table \"Remuneration for the financial year\" goes above and beyond the requirements of §162 AktG. It includes the contributions to base salary and perquisites made in the respective financial year, as well as the annual bonus for the respective financial year and the allocation amount of the share-based remuneration for the financial year.\n\nThe amounts for the annual bonus and LTI allocation reported here result from the achievement of the targets for the financial year. The information therefore directly depicts the correlation between remuneration and business development.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration for the financial year is decisive for reviewing the retention of the general payout cap of € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management and € 6,000 thou for a regular member. It is reviewed prior to the payout in 2028 of the LTI tranches allocated for the 2023 financial year, and reported in the Remuneration Report for the respective financial year.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed in both tables, even if these expenses are not regarded as remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 AktG. Finally, in addition to the absolute amounts, the share of the individual remuneration components relative to the total remuneration is stated.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the information provided for by the Stock Corporation Act on remuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management is shown in a separate table.\n\nThe following diagram presents the allocation of the remuneration components in the two tables, using the financial year 2023 as an example:\n\nImage /page/39/Figure/12 description: The image is a timeline diagram illustrating the remuneration process for Allianz employees. The timeline spans from the financial year when remuneration is determined, pursuant to Section 162 AktG (payout), to the year 2028. Key elements include 'LTI/RSU 2023/2024,' 'Fixed remuneration + annual bonus 2023,' and 'Remuneration for the financial year (actual grant).' The timeline also notes 'AEI 2019 RSU,' which ended its performance period and payout in 2023. Important dates are marked, such as March 2024 for the payment of the annual bonus and allocation of LTI/RSU 2023/2024, and March 2028 for the payout of LTI/RSU 2023/2024. A key performance indicator is the four-year performance of the Allianz share, based on absolute share price performance and relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Remuneration in the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 (1) sentence 1 AktG.

According to the remuneration system applicable at the time of the allocation, the RSU payout is solely dependent on the absolute share price performance and capped at 200% above the grant price. During the term of the AEI/RSU 2019 tranche, the decisive price of the Allianz share rose from € 193.66 to € 219.06. The increase, and therefore the payout, remained significantly below this cap.\n\n### **Remuneration for the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration for the financial year. It contains the variable remuneration amounts resulting directly from the target achievement of the financial year: the annual bonus – as in the remuneration in the financial year table above – and the allocation amount of the LTI grant for the financial year.\n\n#### **Individual remuneration: 2023 and 2022**\n\n€ thou (total might not sum up due to rounding)\n\n|                                               |      |  | Fixed compensation |             |        | Variable short-term |        | Variable long-term          |        |                    |        | Total             | Pension         |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|--|--------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| Board members                                 |      |  | Base salary        | Perquisites |        | Annual bonus        |        | Share-based<br>compensation |        | Other compensation |        | compen-<br>sation | service<br>cost | Total |       |\n| Board members active in financial year        |      |  | € thou             | in % of TC  | € thou | in % of TC          | € thou | in % of TC                  | € thou | in % of TC         | € thou | € thou            | € thou          |       |       |\n| Oliver Bäte                                   | 2023 |  | 2,007              | 26          | 35     |                     | 2,033  | 26                          | 3,658  | 47                 | -

The earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement – operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nDr. Günther Thallinger received the share-based compensation for the first time in the 2022 financial year and Giulio Terzariol in 2023. The significant change from 2020 to 2021 in Dr. Klaus-Peter Röhler's remuneration is explained by the fact that he joined the Board of Management during the year, so the remuneration reported for 2020 is pro rata only. The same rationale applies to the increase from 2021 to 2022 in Dr. Andreas Wimmer's remuneration, as he joined during 2021.\n\nRemuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management for the financial years following their departure comprises mainly pension payments, share-based compensation payouts, and other remuneration.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Comparative presentation**\n\n|                                                    | Development of Board of Management compensation, profit, and average compensation of employees |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--|\n| Financial year                                     | 2019                                                                                           | Change<br>2019 to 2020<br>in % | 2020  | Change<br>2020 to 2021<br>in % | 2021  | Change<br>2021 to 2022<br>in % | 2022  | Change<br>2022 to 2023<br>in % | 2023  |  |\n| Board of management compensation in € thou         |                                                                                                |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n| Board members active in financial year             |                                                                                                |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n| Oliver Bäte                                        | 5,058                                                                                          | 6                              | 5,350 | 11                             | 5,912 | (4)                            | 5,660 | 12                             | 6,357 |  |\n| Sirma Boshnakova (appointed: 01/2022)              | -

Furthermore, the structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly reviewed with regard to its compliance with German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n- − The set total remuneration is both aligned with the scale and scope of the Supervisory Board's duties and appropriate in view of the Company's activities and its business and financial situation. This also reflects the contribution made by the monitoring activity of the Supervisory Board to the long-term development of the Company.\n- − The remuneration takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, or Committee memberships.\n- − The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of management as well as independent decisions on executive personnel and remuneration.\n- − Given Allianz's relative size and complexity as well as its sustainable performance, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board is oriented towards the fourth quartile of the supervisory board remuneration of peers in the DAX.\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE provides for a fixed remuneration. Supervisory Board members who had only served on the Supervisory Board during part of the financial year receive one twelfth of the remuneration for each month of service commenced. This shall apply accordingly for membership of Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Remuneration System was presented to the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE on 4 May 2023 and was approved with a majority vote of 95.07 %.\n\n### **Fixed annual remuneration**\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the financial year. Each regular Supervisory Board member receives a fixed remuneration amounting to € 150 thou per year. The Chairperson receives € 450 thou, each Deputy Chairperson receives € 225 thou.\n\n### **Committee-related remuneration**\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration which is also paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the financial year. The committee-related remuneration is as shown in the graph below:\n\n### **Attendance fees and expenses**\n\nIn addition to the fixed and committee-related remuneration, members of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of € 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend in person. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. The attendance fee is payable after the respective meeting.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with their Supervisory Board activities. The company provides insurance coverage and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties.\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/18 description: The image shows a table describing the fixed annual remuneration and committee remuneration for different positions. Under the category of fixed annual remuneration, the chairperson receives €450,000, the deputy chairperson receives €225,000, and a regular member receives €150,000. Under the category of committee remuneration, the chairperson receives €150,000 for the audit committee, €50,000 for the standing committee, and €25,000 for the nomination committee. A member receives €75,000 for the audit committee, €25,000 for the standing committee, and €12,500 for the nomination committee.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 AktG.

following overview compares the annual development of the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the average remuneration of employees, and selected earnings parameters over the last five financial years. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board presented in the table corresponds to the total remuneration awarded and due in the respective financial year.\n\nIn the case of Ms. Rashmy Chatterjee and Mr. Primiano Di Paolo, the significant change from 2022 to 2023 is due to the fact that only pro rata remuneration is reported for both of them for the 2022 financial year, as they joined the Supervisory Board during the year.\n\nThe earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement – operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of fulltime equivalents.\n\n#### **Comparative presentation**\n\n|                                                                                                                                         | Comparative information | Development of Supervisory Board compensation, profit, and average compensation of employees |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| Financial year                                                                                                                          | 2019                    | Change<br>2019 to 2020<br>in %                                                               | 2020  | Change<br>2020 to 2021<br>in % | 2021  | Change<br>2021 to 2022<br>in % | 2022  | Change<br>2022 to 2023<br>in % | 2023  |\n| Supervisory Board compensation in € thou                                                                                                |                         |                                                                                              |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n| Active members in financial year                                                                                                        |                         |                                                                                              |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n| Michael Diekmann                                                                                                                        | 484.0                   | -

The Allianz Group serves around 125 million private and corporate customers[1](#page-52-1). Allianz SE, the parent company of the Allianz Group, has its headquarters in Munich, Germany.\n\nThe Allianz Group's structure reflects both our business segments and geographical regions. Business activities are organized by product and type of service, based on how these are strategically managed: insurance activities, asset management activities, and corporate and other activities. Due to differences in the nature of products, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into the two categories property-casualty and life/health. In accordance with the Board of Management's responsibilities, each of the insurance categories is grouped into regional reportable segments. In 2023, the Allianz Group had 11 reportable segments.\n\n### **Allianz Group structure – business segments and reportable segments[2](#page-52-2)**\n\n| Property-Casualty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Life/Health                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| - German Speaking Countries and<br>Central & Eastern Europe<br>- Western & Southern Europe,<br>Allianz Direct, and Allianz<br>Partners<br>- Asia Pacific<br>- Global Insurance Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia & Latin America,<br>Middle East, and Africa | - German Speaking Countries and<br>Central & Eastern Europe<br>- Western & Southern Europe<br>- Asia Pacific<br>- USA<br>- Global Insurance Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia & Latin America,<br>Middle East, and Africa |\n| Asset Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Corporate and Other                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| - Asset Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Corporate and Other                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Insurance operations\n\nWe offer a wide range of property-casualty and life/health insurance products to both retail and corporate customers.

In 2023, we received two coal-related requests from our operating entities to exempt corporate clients from companybased restrictions related to both P&C insurance and proprietary investment segments. Of these, one was granted and one was not granted. The granted one was a 1.5 °C exemption, which means that the company was assessed to be on a 1.5 °C pathway despite its coal exposure. The option to grant a grace period of one year for companies aligned with well below 2 °C was granted four times in 2022. As of January 2023, this was no longer possible as per the guideline's rules. The requirement to refer business for so-called green exemptions – i.e., permission to underwrite or invest in renewable energy projects of companies restricted based on the coal guideline, for example – was removed in February 2023 when the new Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline was published. As a result, there is no further reporting on those exemptions.\n\nThe publicly available 5th version of the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework (formerly the ESG Integration Framework) on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**, lays out these main internal policies and processes related to our overarching sustainability risk approach.\n\nThe subsequent sections will outline specific policies applicable to proprietary investments and insurance.\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nAccording to the GHG protocol, reporting on emissions associated with insurance underwriting activities is optional. In our motor retail and commercial insurance portfolios, we have made important progress in measuring insurance-associated emissions and we set inaugural emission reduction targets in 2023. For these targets, we follow the methodology of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard.[1](#page-63-0)\n\nAccording to the standard, insurance-associated emissions (IAE) for commercial lines are calculated by multiplying an attribution factor (i.e., for commercial lines this is the insurance premium divided by insured customer's revenue) by the absolute GHG emissions of the re/insured customer or asset. The attribution factor determines what share of the absolute emissions of an insured customer or asset is attributable to re/insurance.\n\nFor the portfolio in scope of the emission reduction target for commercial insurance, the baseline insurance-associated emissions in 2022 was 1.00 mn t CO2e and the insurance-associated emission intensity was 0.26 kt CO2e/€ mn GWP.[2](#page-63-0) Given the lack of reliable and comparable data on customer Scope 3 emissions, our commercial baseline currently only covers our customers' Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\nFor motor retail, the calculation considers the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of insured vehicles within a portfolio and multiplies them by an attribution factor. The attribution factor represents the insurance industry's share of the total cost of ownership of a vehicle, which includes other costs such as depreciation, fuel, and maintenance. The carbon emissions of the insured vehicles are multiplied by the industry attribution factor (calculated by PCAF as 6.99 % for 2023) to calculate the insurance-associated emissions.\n\nFor the motor retail portfolios covered by the emission reduction target, the baseline for absolute insurance-associated emissions in 2022 was 2.10 mn t CO2[3](#page-63-1) (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) in line with the PCAF standard.\n\n### **Overall GHG emission reduction target**\n\nFor commercial insurance, we are setting an intensity target for the sub-portfolio of large companies in all sectors, which is managed by Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty. We are focusing on those companies for which GHG emission data is available. For the 2022 baseline, this cohort represented 13 % of the premiums in the commercial segment for which emission accounting methodologies are currently available.[4](#page-63-2) Our target is to reduce the emission intensity of this sub-portfolio by 45 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline (see table \"2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions\").\n\nOur target of a 45 % emission intensity reduction for this subportfolio refers to emission intensity as the main KPI and not to the absolute insurance-associated emissions (in tonnes of CO2e). Emission intensity shows the volume of customer-generated emissions associated with every € 1 million of premium we write (tonnes <span id=\"page-63-2\"></span><span id=\"page-63-1\"></span><span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>CO2e/million EUR). While defining an intensity target allows us to reflect the expected growth of our portfolio by 2030 in a dynamic way, our targeted reduction is still within the scenario range of necessary absolute reduction to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. For further information, please refer to section \"Transition Plan & Strategy\". In addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) of the International Energy Agency.\n\nOur first intermediary target for commercial lines targets the subportfolio with the largest climate impact and adequate GHG data quality. This will allow us to steer our portfolio and measure our progress based on reasonable and verifiable GHG emission data, rather than overly relying on sector estimates.\n\nFor retail insurance, we are setting a target to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our motor retail portfolio. For the motor retail portfolio, the target covers nine key European markets, namely: Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. Our target is to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 30 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline. Portfolios classified as in scope are aligned with the PCAF standard for personal motor.\n\nFor the 2022 baseline, the in-scope portfolios within these markets represent 55 % of the motor retail premiums. The target focuses on the most relevant motor markets for Allianz where the biggest impact can be made. This includes where there is adequate and reliable data available, in order for emissions to be measured and progress against our target to be accurately tracked.\n\nIn addition, our target setting is aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C and was informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using scenarios from external data partners.\n\n4\\_In line with Lines of Business currently covered by the PCAF Standard. Scope coverage is unchanged compared to the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan. Share of premiums related to GHG reduction target follows IFRS definition of gross written premiums and deviates from PCAF, which excludes external acquisition costs; following PCAF definition of insurance premiums, scope coverage represents roughly 16 % of the eligible premiums in the commercial segment. More details can be found in the explanatory notes.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_For further details on the methodology please refer to the explanatory notes on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)**. An exception to the application of the PCAF standard is made for the calculation of Insurance-Associated Emissions (IEAs) for insurance policies as defined in the Allianz Statement on renewable/ lowcarbon energy, as the standard does not yet specify accounting rules for the measurement of IEAs related to these types of assets.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions**\n\n|              | Unit of<br>targets  | Target<br>2030 | Baseline<br>2022 | Delta target<br>2030 vs<br>Baseline<br>2022 (%) |\n|--------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Commercial   | kt CO2e/€<br>mn GWP | 0.14           | 0.26             | (45.0)                                          |\n| Retail motor | mn t CO21           | 1.47           | 2.10             | (30.0)                                          |\n\n1\\_Motor retail target is CO2 emissions only, not CO2e, to be consistent with the data which is currently available.\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\n#### **Insured customers decarbonization**\n\nIn the commercial insurance business, our aim is to drive decarbonization across all industry sectors and partner with our customers on their net-zero journeys by leveraging collaboration, sustainability expertise, and best practice, as well as our influence as a major global insurance company.\n\nTo this end, we will proactively approach customers to foster dialogue and encourage a shift toward science-based net-zero strategies. Firstly, each year we will engage with the top 100 customers, selected by premium size and average industry sector emission intensity, who do not currently have an emissions reporting or a disclosure approach and are therefore currently not in scope for our emission reduction target. By taking this step, we are endeavoring to raise awareness for increased transparency and data exchange and ultimately aiming to close the GHG reporting gap in our portfolio. Secondly, we will engage with customers within the transportation industry – specifically aviation and marine – by leveraging bestpractice exchanges on decarbonization strategies for these sectors. Thirdly, we will seek dedicated exchanges with two to three companies per year on their net-zero strategies. For this engagement category, we will screen our portfolio to identify high-emitting companies who have not yet developed science-based net-zero strategies. Sustainability teams within AGCS will support in the selection of engagement candidates and prepare the engagement dialogues, which will be conducted jointly with the distribution and underwriting teams.\n\nFor motor retail insurance, we will also actively engage with our customers to encourage the transition to net-zero. We aim to engage with 20 million current and potential customers by 2030 to support their transition to electric mobility, mainly through Allianz-developed online platforms, newsletters and advertising. The 20 million target reflects the current and estimated future number of customers in the markets defined as in scope, who do not own a battery electric vehicle (BEV). Engagement will include focusing on the benefits of switching to electric mobility and the practicalities of doing so, for example home charging infrastructure and insurance options.\n\nTo increase our share of sustainably-minded customers, we will offer mileage-based products to reward customers who are actively seeking to reduce their emissions. Our aim in offering such solutions is to encourage change across the insurance sector in how we, as an industry, approach motor insurance.\n\nBy offering mileage-based products, we will ensure fair and riskadequate pricing for our customers that aligns with our technical excellence program. Increasing our market share of BEVs will enable us to collect more data and thus improve the accuracy of our risk models. We are committed to understanding the risks, gathering data, and being actively involved in research in order to ensure our net-zero plan invests in society to the benefit of all.\n\nTo support the implementation of our actions, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE will support engagement activities, which will be achieved in collaboration with OEs.\n\n#### **Portfolio steering**\n\nFurthermore, for commercial portfolios, we are committing to actively supporting the net-zero transition by fostering profitable growth and scaling up of renewable energy, low-carbon and other transition technologies that are a key element of the net-zero transformation. Concretely, we aim to profitably grow revenues in Property Damage (PD) and Business Interruption (BI) coverages related to these transition solutions[1](#page-64-0) by 150 % by 2030 compared to 2022.\n\nIn addition, we are applying the energy-related guidelines as laid out in the section \"Overarching Policies\". The focus on these highemitting sectors is an important lever and contributor to the targeted reduction of emissions intensity at portfolio level.\n\nRestricted companies are listed in the Global ESG Risk List, which is available to all underwriters globally. Training on the application of the policies is offered regularly to support underwriting teams with their implementation.\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>To ensure we deliver on our targets, we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities to allow for ownership of the topics and monitoring of progression toward completion. Although targets are stated as 2030, there are clear internal interim timelines and reporting processes that will allow for regular monitoring of progress.\n\nAdditionally, to support the implementation of our decarbonization strategy for commercial lines, we have set up two dedicated sustainability teams in the AGCS Chief Technical Office (CTO). The Sustainability Governance team oversees the implementation of portfolio strategy, target setting, monitoring, and reporting. The Sustainability Solutions team focuses on business growth and expansion in line with our \"insuring the transition\" actions. Both teams work closely together and support our distribution and underwriting teams. In addition, our Allianz Risk Consulting teams continue to provide expertise on emerging technology requirements and challenges.\n\nTo further support the transition to net-zero within our motor retail portfolio, we aim by 2030 to insure a larger percentage of BEVs in the Allianz portfolios compared to the share of BEVs in the respective inscope markets.\n\nTo enable this portfolio change, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for BEVs and the related ecosystem, in order to support our customers in transitioning to this new technology. Our ambition is to be a market leader for BEVs and we have implemented a mobility strategy in order to support this transition. This strategy is an ongoing project with key deliverables and drives our ambition to be a market leader through strategy development, global exchanges, monitoring, and reporting.\n\nA workstream within the technical area oversees the implementation of our mobility strategy. This workstream has a focus on technical leadership in electric vehicles, supporting our markets in the development and implementation of action plans to meet our targets, as well as ensuring the regular delivery and monitoring of key performance indicators. It also utilizes Allianz's global presence through regular exchanges with OEs as part of internal Mobility Smart Circle meetings and optimizing the pooling of mobility data across countries, leveraging the Group's expertise.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Transition solutions include the technologies mentioned in the Allianz Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Statement, as well as waste to energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS)/direct air capture, battery storage and grid-stability-related investments, smart grids and electrification, electric transportation, EV\n\nand battery manufacturing plants, electric mass transit infrastructure construction (rail), certified green buildings, industry projects related to energy transition (ammonia and bio-based/synthetic fuels), and green shipping. We have started working on harmonizing terminology and underlying eligible\n\ntechnologies related to the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions (currently used for P&C insurance). We expect to conclude this work and report on it in 2024 fiscal year.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditionally, to support the implementation of the overall decarbonization strategy for motor retail, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE oversees target and strategy development, portfolio steering, reporting and monitoring, data maintenance, and quality assurance.\n\n### **Insurance-specific policies**\n\nAll relevant aspects of our insurance portfolios are governed by the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU). Ownership and execution of the Standard sits with Global P&C and is governed by the Group Underwriting Committee (GUC). However, ultimate responsibility resides with the Allianz SE Board of Management. The ASU governs the rules and principles for P&C Underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture. Its rules and principles focus on underwriting sustainable and profitable business. The ASU includes our principles for sustainability and codifies roles and responsibilities within operating entities related to the decarbonization of underwriting portfolios.\n\nThe objectives of the Sustainable Insurance section of the ASU include: developing sustainable business opportunities, building resilience and anticipating future developments and adapting to them, safeguarding against reputational risks, and taking adequate corporate responsibility for our planet.\n\nThe ASU is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant internal stakeholders.\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nFor our proprietary investment portfolio, we are calculating financed GHG emissions according to PCAF guidance and expanding the methodology to asset classes not yet covered by PCAF. Although we aspire to calculate financed GHG emissions for as much of our portfolio as possible, we are constrained by the development of methodologies and availability of data. Nevertheless, we remain committed to progressively expanding the coverage of our portfolio over time.\n\nWe do not calculate financed GHG emissions for covered bonds, ABS/MBS and cash as there is no methodology available yet for these asset classes. To see these asset classes, please see lines \"no methodology\" in table \"Financed emissions\".\n\nWe calculate three types of financed GHG emissions defined by the underlying investment: 1) Corporates, which includes all investees with a balance sheet, i.e., – in PCAF terminology – listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, as well as project finance; 2) Real Estate, which includes commercial real estate loans and real estate equity investments; and 3) Public Debt, which includes sovereign debt, sub-sovereign debt, and supranational debt. As there is no specific PCAF guidance on carbon accounting for sub-sovereigns and supranationals, we have adapted the methodology for sovereign debt to these two asset classes. We do not cover 100 % of our exposure in these three types of financed GHG emissions (i.e., Corporates, Real Estate and Public Debt) due to the lack of relevant emission data information. To see this data coverage gap, please see column \"coverage\" in table \"Financed emissions\".\n\nFor a detailed description of our carbon accounting methodology, please refer to our explanatory notes on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nIn 2023, our total financed GHG emissions were 57.3 mn t CO2e compared to 46.4 mn t CO2e in 2022 (see table \"Financed emissions\"). The increase was driven in particular by adding new asset classes like sub-sovereigns, supranationals, and infrastructure debt.\n\nOur total coverage of financed GHG emissions increased from 59.6 % to 62.1 %.\n\nThe table below shows the book value, financed GHG emissions, and coverage (i.e., percentage of book value for which financed GHG emissions are calculated) per carbon footprint methodology and is split into IFRS 9 asset classes.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\n### **Financed emissions**\n\n|                                                                                        | 2023                 |                                               |                                               |                 | 2022                 |                                               |                                               |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                                        | Book value<br>(€ bn) | Absolute financed<br>emissions<br>(mn t CO₂e) | Carbon intensity<br>(t CO₂e/€ mn<br>invested) | Coverage<br>(%) | Book value<br>(€ bn) | Absolute financed<br>emissions<br>(mn t CO₂e) | Carbon intensity<br>(t CO₂e/€ mn<br>invested) | Coverage<br>(%) |\n| Corporates                                                                             | 294.2                | 20.1                                          | 64.7                                          | 90.6            | 194.3                | 16.6                                          | 75.1                                          | -

Thus we in general follow the recommendations of the NZAOA for setting intermediate decarbonization targets. While the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol (NZAOA TSP) defines targets for engagements, sectors and financing the transition, we display these as actions in line with ESRS E1. The NZAOA TSP was aligned with all relevant stakeholders and vetted in a public consultation and was developed with a strong reference to the 1.5°C no/low overshoot climate scenarios in the latest report of the IPCC. For further information, please see section \"The scientific basis for establishing net-zero targets\" of the **[NZAOA TSP](https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AOA-Target-Setting-Protocol-Third-edition.pdf)**[1](#page-67-0) .\n\nWe have already reached our intermediate 2025 decarbonization target for corporate bonds and listed equities in 2023 as we reduced our financed GHG emissions by 44% against the target of a 25 % reduction. For full 2025 target reporting, please refer to the section \"03.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**. We have also reached our targets for engagements and financing the transition. For further information, please refer to the section \"Decarbonization Levers\".\n\nWe have therefore decided to update our complete range of targets in 2023 and define new targets for 2030. When setting these targets, we considered potential future developments in large industries, especially the E.U. and the U.S., based on the latest climate law and regulation; i.e., \"Fit for 55\" and the \"Inflation Reduction Act\". We also wanted our new targets to include what we have learned from previous years; e.g., related to data availability. The targets remain in line with the latest science (IPCC report) and industry best practice (NZAOA TSP) and are broader in terms of coverage and depth. For a detailed explanation of our 2030 targets, please refer to Explaining Allianz Intermediate Climate Target Setting 2030 for Proprietary Investments[2](#page-67-0) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Explaining-Allianz-Intermediate-Climate-Target-Setting-2030-for-Proprietary-Investments.pdf)**.\n\nAs of the financial year 2024, we will only report on our new 2030 targets.\n\n### **Overall GHG emission reduction target**\n\nWe have set an absolute GHG emission reduction target for listed corporates (corporate bonds and public equity). Our target is to reduce absolute GHG emissions in the respective asset classes by 50% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline emissions.\n\nWe have added a 2030 emission intensity reduction target covering all listed and unlisted corporate exposure (e.g., infrastructure debt) in the amount of 50% compared to the 2019 baseline emission intensity (see table \"2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments\").\n\nA reduction of 50% is in line with latest IPCC scenarios and equals the midpoint of the respective scenario range from 40 % to 60 %. For <span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>further information, please refer to section \"1.5 °C alignment of targets\" and the work of the NZAOA with the IPCC scenario[s3](https://www.unepfi.org/industries/target-setting-protocol-third-edition/) .\n\nFor unlisted corporates, we are still in the process of gathering emission data and we do not know beforehand how many of our portfolio companies and indirect investments via funds will deliver data in the coming years until 2030. As data coverage is uncertain and changing, we cannot set a reasonable absolute GHG emission reduction target for our overall corporate portfolio. An intensity metric does not rely on coverage as absolute GHG emissions are divided by the respective portfolio exposure. We therefore decided to set an emission intensity reduction target for our listed and unlisted corporates portfolio for 2030.\n\nWe have set 2030 targets that are aligned with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (**[CRREM](https://www.crrem.eu/)**) for our real estate equity and debt portfolios. These sectoral decarbonization pathways are based on the latest science, supported by the Science Based Targets initiative, and widely accepted as best practice.\n\nOur progress toward target achievement will be monitored regularly and reported in the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nThe table below shows Allianz intermediate 2030 decarbonization targets as well as the respective baseline year values, where available. We have defined GHG emission reduction targets for corporates and real estate.\n\n#### **2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments**\n\n|                                                              | Book value 2023<br>(€ bn) | % of total | Unit of targets         | Target 2030 | Current year 2023 | Baseline year 2019 | Delta Target 2030 vs<br>Baseline 2019 (%) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| All Corporates (Listed and Unlisted)                         | 294.2                     | 39.9       | t CO2e/€ mn<br>invested | 54.0        | 64.7              | 108.1              | (50.0)                                    |\n| thereof: Listed Corporates (Traded Equity / Corporate Bonds) | 192.2                     | 26.1       | mn t CO2e               | 12.5        | 14.0              | 24.9               | (50.0)                                    |\n| Real Estate (Equity and Debt)1,2,5                           | 110.6                     | 15.0       | kg CO2/m2               | ca. 25.0    | 33.5              | -                  | -                                         |\n| No methodology3                                              | 165.4                     | 22.4       | -                       | -           | -                 | -                  | -                                         |\n| No target yet4                                               | 166.6                     | 22.6       | mn t CO2e               | -           | 36.7              | -                  | -                                         |\n| Total                                                        | 736.8                     | 100.0      | -                       | -           | -                 | -                  | -                                         |\n\n1\\_Including 50 % of real estate funds and w/o retail mortgages.\n\n2\\_Including Pimco Prime Real Estate portfolio.\n\n3\\_This includes asset classes for which no methodology exists yet, e.g. covered bonds and cash.\n\n4\\_This includes asset classes for which we calculate owned emissions but have no targets yet, e.g. sovereign bonds.\n\n5\\_Target 2030: Exact target depends on regional and sectorial portfolio composition 12/2029.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\n#### **Portfolio allocation change**\n\nThe scope of actions outlined below to implement portfolio allocation changes is in line with the scope of our overall GHG emission reduction targets; i.e., covering our global exposure in corporates and real estate.\n\nAs an investment management function, we have set targets and frameworks for our asset managers that will ultimately lead to a change in our portfolio allocation with respect to asset classes, investees, and sectors.\n\nAs we have set overall GHG reduction targets on a Group-wide level, we start by breaking down the global target to individual mandate level. Each asset manager is then responsible for reaching the respective mandate decarbonization target by taking appropriate actions. For real estate, for example, these actions might include tenant engagement, portfolio transactions, and deep refurbishments. We hold regular deep-dive meetings where we monitor and discuss the decarbonization performance of our asset managers against the set targets.\n\nAs well as setting decarbonization targets per mandate, we exclude certain companies in line with our global energy-related guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas. For further information, please refer to section \"Overarching Policies\". These exclusions therefore contribute to the implementation of our sector targets for oil & gas and utilities that are outlined below. All excluded companies are included in the Allianz Group Risk Global Restricted List and are shared with all asset managers on a regular basis. Asset managers are obliged to comply with these restrictions.\n\nWe aim to finance the transition of companies in the hard-toabate cement and steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5 °C world and have well-defined decarbonization strategies. We will therefore create a separate emission bucket and adjust the sub-portfolio target for listed equity and corporate bonds to reflect additional exposure in those transition leaders included on our new steel and cement climate list.\n\nWe have set sector targets for the high-emitting sectors listed below. These targets will trigger three types of actions supporting our overall GHG emission reduction target: sector engagements (for further information, please refer to section \"Portfolio company decarbonization\"), exclusions, and moving from climate laggards to climate leaders within the respective sectors:\n\n- − Oil & Gas (coverage Allianz O&G 100 list):\n\t- − Scope 1, 2 and 3 (cat 11): 43.07 g CO2e/MJ in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\t- − 100 % of AuM to set net-zero targets across all 3 emission scopes (target year 2025)\n- − Utilities (Coverage Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)):\n\t- − Scope 1: 0.17 t CO2e/MWh in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\t- − Coal phase out in line with 1.5 °C pathway\n- − Steel (Coverage TPI):\n- − Scope 1 and 2: 1.18 t CO2e/t steel in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n- − Automobile (Coverage TPI):\n\t- − Scope 3 (cat 11): 41.68 g CO2e/km in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\nIn 2023, we added the sectors Steel and Automobile. For both sectors, we are currently implementing data flows as a first step.\n\nPortfolio decarbonization will also be fostered by increasing our share in Sustainable Investments. We have achieved our 2025 target for financing the transition; i.e., we have created between 4 and 5 new blended finance vehicles and have made initial investments in forestry and hydrogen.\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>We have therefore included a quantitative 2030 target for investments in climate solutions, which is to increase climate solution investments by at least € 20 bn by 2030, subject to market environment and constraints.\n\nAs a first step to reach this target, we have defined all low-carbon technologies that qualify as climate solutions[1](#page-68-0). We need to develop a process to align and agree on concrete volumes per annum with all relevant stakeholders: operating entities, asset managers, and relevant Group centers.\n\nWe have defined two additional requirements for our investments. Firstly, we will predominantly invest in Article 8 or Article 9 funds (or equivalent) as defined by the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Secondly, we will require a credible transition plan for all unlisted direct investment with a carbon intensity above 100 t CO2e/€ mn invested.\n\n### **Portfolio company decarbonization**\n\nThe extent to which we can achieve reduction of GHG emissions for our investee companies and real estate investments depends on the respective ownership structure. For example, in the case of fully-owned real estate assets, we can directly influence GHG emissions by deep refurbishments. However, if we are only a minority owner, we are restricted to indirectly impacting GHG emissions through engagement, for example, or proxy voting (public equity).\n\nOne indirect lever to reach our 2030 GHG emission reduction targets is therefore continued engagement and support of our portfolio companies. We have consequently implemented a systematic and strong engagement approach across all types of engagements: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager. For further information on our engagement approach, please refer to ou[r 2023 –](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf)  [Allianz Investment Management – Our Engagement Approach](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf)**.\n\nWe have already achieved our 2025 engagement targets in 2023 as we have engaged the top 30 (non-aligned) emitters in our portfolio, increased our engagement activities by 100 %, and fully participated in all NZAOA sector and asset manager engagements.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_We have started working on harmonizing terminology and underlying eligible technologies related to the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions (currently used for P&C insurance). We expect to conclude this work and report on it in FY2024.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have therefore updated our engagement targets earlier than originally planned. By 2030 (versus September 2023), we firstly want to engage with all external asset managers who are \"below expectations\" based on a systematic assessment. In order to reach this target, we initially need to perform a systematic sustainability assessment of all of our public and private asset managers. If an asset manager does meet our minimum expectations, we will start engagement to close identified gaps. We regularly review our public equity asset managers against best practice guidance (e.g., NZAOA guidance on best practice for proxy voting and climate lobbying).\n\nSecondly, we want to participate in 30 multilateral engagements (at least 15 of them with a focus on climate), either as the lead organization or as a member. In order to reach this target, we will continuously review existing or new multilateral engagement initiatives. In 2023, we joined the collaborative engagement initiative \"Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals\" (IIHC).\n\nThirdly, we aim to engage with 15 non-multilaterally engaged portfolio emitters among the top 100. We will screen the financed GHG emissions of our portfolio companies to identify those qualifying for engagement; i.e., those with the highest financed GHG emissions that are not already engaged.\n\nAs many of our high emitters in the portfolio can only decarbonize properly if the whole sector – including the value chain – decarbonizes, we are also active in sector engagements via multilateral engagement initiatives. Sector engagements are supporting our sector targets for 2030, in particular in the oil & gas and steel sectors. For more information on our sector targets, please refer to the section \"Portfolio allocation changes\".\n\nThe whole investment management function of Allianz is responsible for implementing climate topics in the existing processes and hence in the investment portfolio.\n\n### **Proprietary investment specific policies**\n\nWe are committed to managing climate change risk identified as a material risk for our proprietary investment portfolio. To align our investment management function with this commitment, we have set ambitious GHG emission reduction targets that incentivize respective decision-making (see table \"2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments\"). Our Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI) sets out the rules, principles, and processes that govern the integration and application of climate topics to the Insurance Investment Assets of Allianz.\n\nThe EFRI provides a detailed description of all relevant processes for integrating climate into the investment processes and managing climate risk:\n\n- − Selecting and monitoring asset managers: Asset managers need to adhere to their own qualified sustainability policy including climate as a key topic. Regular review meetings with asset managers covering sustainability topics need to be performed.\n- − Systematic evaluation and scoring of investments: For unlisted assets, a case-by-case evaluation needs to be performed to identify potential sustainability risks. For listed assets, sustainability criteria based on MSCI data are used to screen all investments and inform our investment decision-making.\n- − Active engagements: As an integral part of our strategy, we perform bilateral engagements based on systematic sustainability scoring, multilateral engagements, and asset manager engagements.\n- − Exclusions of certain sectors, companies and sovereigns: Certain investments need to be excluded based on the Allianz guidelines for Oil and Gas and Coal-based business models. Some exclusions are triggered by engagement.\n- − Sustainable Investments: We define sustainable investments in line with the SFDR Article 2 (17) and actively pursue investment opportunities that support solutions to environmental and societal challenges, aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (U.N. SDGs).\n- − Risk management: The Allianz Climate Change Risk Solution (ACCRiS) tool must be used to assess physical climate change risk for fully-owned real estate and prospectively for all single location assets. Whenever a certain level of physical risk is identified, a climate change adaptation plan needs to be implemented.\n\nFor further details, please refer to section \"02.2.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe EFRI applies to all proprietary investment assets excluding unit-linked assets and is owned by the Sustainable Investing team. It is authorized by the respective Allianz SE Board Member responsible for Investments. The EFRI is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe EFRI is mandatory within the Allianz Group for all insurance and reinsurance legal entities, including related pension schemes and all types of investment assets. Sustainability governance is fully integrated into existing governance structures and makes use of existing committees (e.g., the Group Investment Committee).\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nIn our own operations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint over time. We have established a dedicated unit – Group Sustainable Operations – within Group Operations & IT to align the strategic approach across all Allianz entities, with the aim of reducing their environmental footprint and accelerating impact through setting clear targets and sharing best practice. The main operations in scope are Travel and Fleet, Procurement, Facility Management, and IT.\n\nThe total GHG emissions arising from Allianz Operations were 136,448 t CO2e in 2023. Of that, 31,774 t CO2e result from Scope 1, 7,929 t CO2e from Scope 2, and 96,745 t CO2e from Scope 3. Included Scope 3 GHG emissions from categories 3.1, 3.3, 3.6 and 3.7 cover fueland energy-related emissions, business travel, remote working, public cloud, and paper use. Scope 3 GHG financed emissions which fall under category 3.15 are excluded. For further information, please refer to the section \"Insurance Overarching\" and the section \"Investments Overarching\".

We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target.\n\nOur decarbonization and removal targets for Own Operations remain as communicated in the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBy 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (see section \"Current Emissions\"). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for year-end 2029, 65% versus a 2019 baseline. The target was defined in alignment with the latest climate science. The progress towards our 2030 target is assessed on a yearly basis as part of our annual reporting cycles. In 2023, we made progress by reducing our GHG emissions by 62% per employee compared to our 2019 baseline.\n\n#### **Greenhouse gas emission targets**\n\nt CO2e per employee Emissions Target 2030 Emissions Target 2025 Target 2023 Achievement 2023 Emissions current year 2023 Emissions Baseline 2019 Delta Target 2030 vs Baseline 2019 Delta Target 2025 vs Baseline 2019 Scope 1, 2 and selected scope 3 emissions1 0.828 1.183 We expect in 2023 emissions at a comparable level to 2022 with some post COVID-19 corrections.

RE100 is a global initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.\n\nEnergy sourcing has been a strategic procurement function since 2021 and plays a key role in our transition toward 100% renewable electricity, mainly by shifting energy procurement from locally driven to globally driven processes. Activities in 2023 included leveraging opportunities to agree green tariffs with local power providers and holding conversations with landlords supported by green lease clauses. We encourage green tariffs and local direct investments in Allianz-owned self-generation, centrally supported by PIMCO Prime Real Estate. Furthermore, renewable Energy Attribute Certificates have played a role in the transition to 100%renewable electricity as an interim solution for markets and Allianz entities with limited access to renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved our goal of covering 100% (2022: 89%) of our electricity for all office buildings and data centers with renewable, low carbon sources. 98.6% of this is in line with the RE100 technical criteria and 1.4%is secured via renewable Energy Attribute Certificates from neighboring countries as we operate in some countries like Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Ghana[1](#page-71-0) where there is currently no availability of renewable electricity meeting the RE100 criteria. We continue our efforts to cover all our renewable electricity in line with RE100 technical criteria and will closely monitor the market development in the respective countries.\n\n#### **Buildings**\n\nEmbedding sustainability in our buildings encompasses energy efficiency and reduction. We aim to reduce the energy consumption in our office buildings per employee by 20 % by year-end 2025 against a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe implement environmental management systems (EMS) and energy efficiency processes based on ISO14001 and ISO50001 standards to improve environmental management governance practices at some of our major locations and entities. Some locations also pursue certifications such as LEED, BREEA, etc. To address <span id=\"page-71-1\"></span><span id=\"page-71-0\"></span>energy efficiency and reduction holistically, our operating entities are encouraged to develop approaches to reduce energy consumption.\n\nWe have set up a Buildings Standards Catalogue to harmonize Allianz's approach to sustainability in buildings. This comprehensive listing of minimum standards includes elements of governance- /certifications, furnishings, construction/renovations, renewable energy, energy efficiency, water, waste, food, and commuting, as well as guidance on green lease selection criteria.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved a 47 % reduction in energy consumption in our office buildings per employee compared to our 2019 baseline (2022: 32 %).\n\n#### **Fleet and business travel**\n\nWhen it comes to fleet and business travel, our aim is to continuously reduce corresponding GHG emissions now that COVID-19 measures have been lifted and business trips are permitted again. We aim to reduce our GHG emissions from business travel by 40 % by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. As a signatory of the EV100 initiative, Allianz has committed to fully electrify the company fleet by 2030 at the latest.\n\nThe current travel regulation is under review and – once updated in 2024 – will encompass climate-related topics for business travel. In addition, our travel tools offer a sort and filter function based on CO2 emissions for flight searches. Further, meetings should be held digitally whenever possible.\n\nIn 2023,GHG emissions from business travel were reduced by 44 % per employee against a 2019 baseline[3](#page-71-0) (2022: 47 %). As of 2023, 22 % of our fleet vehicles are electrified[4](#page-71-1) (2022: 11%).\n\n#### **Procurement**\n\nWith regard to our supply chain, our target is to ensure that 100% of global framework vendors – i.e., vendors providing products and services for Allianz globally – have made a public commitment to netzero GHG emissions in line with a 1.5 °C path by 2025.\n\nThe procurement function sources services and products for the Allianz Group by partnering with thousands of vendors all around the world for activities such as IT, professional services, and marketing. Our procurement policy and processes are reviewed regularly. In 2022, they were updated to align with the Allianz Group sustainability strategy and to embed the operations sustainability strategy across procurement activities. To ensure our IT partners are following our\n\n4\\_Including battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Full list of countries: Hong Kong, Bahrain, Cameroon, Ghana, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lebanon, Senegal, Madagascar, Laos, Myanmar, Qatar, Reunion Island, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) are certifications assessing the sustainability of buildings based on a rating system.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\\_GHG emissions from business travel were restated for 2019 (new absolute: 140,787 t CO2e, new relative: 1.0 t CO2e per employee).

The catalogue of questions covers environmental aspects in four categories (Hardware, Software, Application/ Infrastructure & Communication) and produces a rating based on defined sustainability criteria.\n\nOur assessment indicates that, in 2023, 76 % of global framework vendors had an existing net-zero commitment (2022: 65%).\n\nSustainability forms part of the individual contribution factor of the remuneration of each member of the Allianz SE Board of Management. This extends to the decarbonization targets of proprietary investments as well as own operations. For further information, please refer to [Remuneration Report](#page-25-0) and the section \"Corporate responsibility governance and strategy\".\n\nClimate change will materially affect global economies and Allianz, with its international footprint and many different lines of business, is no exception – as already highlighted in the section on materiality analysis. The risks and opportunities emerging today will evolve and increase over the mid to long term. They include acute and chronic physical impacts on property and human health, such as increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves, droughts, and potential changes in vector-borne diseases.\n\nRisks and opportunities also result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks include the impacts of changes in climate policy, technology, and market sentiment, and their impact on the market value of financial assets, as well as impacts resulting from climate change litigation.\n\n#### **Impact on and impact of our business**\n\nThe AllianzGroupis exposed to risks that are influenced by climate change in a multitude of ways. Our core business activities mean that we are affected in two key ways, both of which can influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value:\n\n− As an insurer providing insurance policies – e.g., covering health impacts, property damage, or litigation claims – and through changes in the sectors and business models we underwrite.\n\n− As a large-scale institutional investor with significant interests in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nAs well as being impacted by climate change, the choices Allianz makes about how to conduct our business have an impact on climate change, e.g., by investing in or insuring activities that either cause or reduce GHG emissions. To manage potentially detrimental impacts on both the climate and our business, we have committed to align our proprietary investment and insurance underwriting portfolios to 1.5 °C climate scenarios.\n\n### **Strategy resilience, stress tests, and climate scenario analysis**\n\nClimate change considerations are an integral part of our insurance and investment strategy.\n\nWe apply various quantitative and qualitative strategies when carrying out climate stress testing and scenario analysis. Considerations in this regard include the long-term horizons over which climate change may unfold and the high level of uncertainty over the direction of future climate and economic developments. Our objective is to foster risk awareness, build expertise in the assessment of financial risks from climate change, test our business strategy resilience, and inform risk management and business decision-making.\n\nWe perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons up to 2050 and including scenarios ranging from 1.5 °C to 4 °C of average warming by the end of the century. While time horizons naturally differ depending on the lines of business under consideration, the range of scenarios we apply allows us to better assess a variety of risks associated with climate change.\n\nWhen we conduct analyses that assess 1.5 °C scenario alignment, we adjust our scenario selection using guidance developed by the NZAOA that is focused on 1.5 °C scenarios with no or low overshoot of 1.5 °C of warming. This limits the need to remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere in the second half of the century.\n\nWhen conducting outside-in impact scenario analysis, we use a broader range of scenarios in terms of temperature outcomes and characteristics. Qualitative assessments are conducted to explore to what extent and across which channels climate change risks affect distinct aspects of our business, unconstrained by the still limited availability of quantitative models to fully cover all aspects of climate change across our entire business activities. We deploy quantitative assessments for indicative sizing of our exposure to climate change risks. A top-down approach is developed to assess risks at the level of our balance sheet. Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most relevant exposures provides insights into climate change risks at the level of individual investment or underwriting projects and may support contextualization of results from top-down analyses.\n\nIt should be noted that the analyses included in this report reflect our current approaches to climate change risk assessments. Prevailing methodological and data limitations as well as the high degree of uncertainty inherent in any long-term analysis may still limit the decisionmaking usefulness of some results. However, these approaches will change over time as climate scenarios evolve in line with research, developmental-stage methods improve further, and industry best practices emerge.\n\n#### **Qualitative assessment of climate change risks**\n\nThe guiding objective of the qualitative climate change risk assessment is comprehensiveness, whereby it is important to identify the many ways that Allianz's risk profile can be adversely affected across all areas of the business, in both the short, medium and long term. There are multiple ways in which climate change may trigger risk events, so it is essential that this understanding is established in enough detail for it to provide a solid basis for applying risk-based prioritization with the aim of evaluating mitigation effectiveness and management actions.\n\nTo achieve full coverage of Allianz's business footprint, the assessment was structured along investments, property-casualty underwriting, life/health underwriting, operations, with investments and underwriting further subdivided into asset class and line of business, respectively. For each area (or alternatively, asset class for investments, and line of business for underwriting), the main relevant climate change-related risk drivers were identified. In this context, a risk driver is any development or event wholly or primarily attributable to climate change that potentially impacts Allianz's risk profile. Such risk drivers can be categorized into technological, regulatory, legal, and consumer behavior developments (transition risks), as well as physical risks such as floods, drought, or wildfires.\n\nFor each risk driver, a range of potential short- to medium-term and long-term impacts for the insurance sector was considered, utilizing knowledge acquired via a combination of desktop research and consultation with subject matter experts both internal and external to Allianz. Lastly, the potential magnitude of each of these risk impacts was assessed against various dimensions of financial and non-financial performance.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\nThe initial qualitative risk assessment was performed throughout 2022 at the Allianz Group level. During 2023, subsidiaries adapted the assessment according to their local risk profiles. The outcome of this exercise provides further insights into the relevance of climate change risk drivers for both the AllianzGroup as a whole and individual subsidiaries, taking into account their specific business profile, geographical presence, and locally applicable regulations.\n\nFor a summary of the main climate change risks faced by the Allianz Group as well as corresponding impacts derived from the qualitative risk assessment, please see tables \"Key climate change transition risks\" and \"Key climate change physical risks\".\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Key climate change transition risks**\n\n| Risk driver                | Context

Emerging technologies      | Climate change mitigation and adaption is driving the rapid<br>development of new or modification of existing technologies (e.g.<br>sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture and storage, electric<br>vehicles).<br>Although many of these technologies presently face challenges in<br>terms of quickly scaling up – whether due to prohibitive cost, an<br>inadequate supply of raw inputs, missing infrastructure, customer<br>skepticism or a need to further develop the technology itself – it is<br>expected that many of these issues will be resolved over time and the<br>technologies will become widely adopted.

disadvantages via a combination of higher energy costs,<br>higher financing costs or costs from participation in carbon emissions trading schemes. On the revenues side, customers may become<br>adverse towards companies that fail to adopt climate-related technologies. This risk is particularly relevant for those business sectors<br>with a comparatively high emissions footprint, such as energy, transportation and construction.<br>- Stranded assets are also possible, whereby technological breakthroughs render older, high emission technologies obsolete, in<br>particular when further squeezed by decarbonization-related regulations. Conversely, it is also possible that promising technologies<br>ultimately fail to deliver on their potential and earn a return on substantial investments in research and development.<br>- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be<br>impacted by the above developments.<br>Underwriting<br>The introduction of new technologies may lead to more frequent and severe malfunctions, damage or process disruptions, especially<br>in the early application phase. Areas of particular vulnerability include electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, such as<br>battery energy storage systems. In this context, providing insurance coverage may represent a challenge for insurers due to the lack<br>of historical claims data as a basis for modeling and pricing, which may trigger an increase in insured manufacturers' product liability |\n| Regulatory<br>developments | As signatories to the Paris Agreement, many countries have adopted<br>legally binding commitments in line with the Paris Agreement target<br>of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well<br>below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the<br>temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.<br>To deliver on these commitments countries are enacting increasingly<br>stringent regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as<br>the phase out of combustion engines, encouraging the adoption of<br>heat pumps or increasing the share of sustainably produced energy.<br>Given the swift and drastic reduction required, the impact of these<br>regulations is widespread across many business sectors, although<br>naturally most consequential for those responsible for the largest<br>share of emissions. | exposure.<br>Investments<br>- Increasingly complex and partly untested regulations promoting mitigation and adaptation to climate change may trigger<br>significant costs or losses for companies operating in high emission sectors, both in terms of implementation costs and as a direct<br>consequence of the policies themselves. Direct consequences include write-down costs, whereby as a result of a regulatory directive,<br>the projected financial return on company assets is diminished.<br>- Furthermore, fragmentation of regulations at a regional and global level may lead to competitive disadvantages based on a<br>company's geographic location, especially for companies that are highly dependent on international trade. Competitive<br>disadvantages may result from either operating under a comparatively strict set of regulations relative to peers (e.g. carbon emission<br>limits), or conversely, due to regulations enacted to counter such environmental arbitrage (e.g. border taxes, restricted market access<br>for companies with poor climate practices).<br>- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be<br>impacted by the above developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Operations<br>- Allianz is committed to full compliance with all climate-change regulations applicable to the organization.

Climate attribution science supports the assignment of responsibility for climate-change related damages to those companies historically responsible for a large share of emissions, whether from the extraction and processing of fossil fuels or their consumption via production or product use (e.g. energy generation, transportation). As the confidence levels of climate attribution models improve they may increasingly be recognized by courts and juries in determining culpability and corresponding damages. Given past studies suggesting a relatively small number of companies are responsible for an outsized share of total historical emissions – primarily within the oil & gas and utility sectors – the legal exposure of these companies in particular may be quite significant. |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | - In addition to the costs or losses directly attributable to climate-change related regulations, companies also face legal exposures for failure to comply. Against the backdrop of sweeping regulations and tight timelines for their adoption – which is unavoidable in the light of nations' legally binding emission reduction commitments – it may prove challenging for certain companies or even entire sectors to fully comply. This is relevant not only for operations and product design, but also climate-change related reporting and disclosure requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | - Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be impacted by the above developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Underwriting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The above climate litigation drivers for investments may also adversely impact Allianz' risk profile with respect to Underwriting Risks. Greenwashing, advances in climate attribution science, new and expanded regulations and an overall increase in climate-change related litigation all introduce new and potentially significant legal exposures for many of Allianz' commercial policyholders, especially those operating in high-emission sectors such as oil & gas, energy generation or transportation. Allianz risk exposures arise from indemnity coverages for legal proceedings against these policyholders, in particular within the D&O and Liability lines of business.

Extreme weather<br>(acute physical risk<br>event)      | Climate change is the primary driver behind a contemporary increase<br>in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which<br>trigger losses in the form of human casualties, physical damages and<br>disruptions to business or leisure activities.

        | Investments<br>- Within the real estate sector property valuations may increasingly be dependent on exposure to extreme weather events, both from<br>a macro- and micro-geographic perspective. The most exposed properties might experience higher losses from property damage, a<br>loss of rental income due to business disruptions and higher insurance and financing costs. While measures may be taken to help<br>mitigate the real estate impact of extreme weather events, such as strengthening structures against wind and flood damage, these<br>typically require costly investments. These issues also largely apply towards the construction and infrastructure sectors as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - At a sovereign level, government finances may become strained through an ever increasing need to finance recovery and repair<br>efforts following catastrophic weather events.

This projection concerns not only property claims due to direct physical damage, but other coverages as well, such as those typically contained within business interruption, accident, entertainment, and travel policies.\n\n- Claims for liability coverages may also increase insofar as policyholders are considered negligent in protecting customers or other third parties from damages caused by extreme weather events.\n\n- In addition to impacts derived from policy exposures, it may also become increasingly cost-prohibitive for Allianz to obtain reinsurance coverages in line with our risk appetite and risk bearing capacity. Such developments might restrict our ability to underwrite some risk exposures and – in extreme cases – precipitate an exit from certain insurance markets.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\noperations and life/health underwriting are also present, albeit to a comparatively dynamic period of transition risk relevance. lesser extent.\n\nmore significant in the short to medium term than in the long term\n\nand property-casualty underwriting.

While this may run contrary to the understanding blunt impact severity in the longer term. This includes both adaptive encouraging movement away from disaster prone areas – and mitigation measures by Allianz, such as improvements in the management of insurance risk concentrations and the pricing of insurance coverages.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen considering the above results, it is important to understand that outcomes of this qualitative process are highly dependent on the input of individual risk experts. Although the process leveraged research and statistical information where possible, professional judgment was applied in determining the impacts specific to Allianz. Provided that professional judgment is subject to various forms of bias, results are liable to change. In addition, the emergence of further statistical and other fact-based research may also influence conclusions.\n\nFor further information on mitigation measures to address and manage risk impacts, please refer to the section \"Conclusion\".\n\n#### **Quantitative assessment of climate change risks**\n\nThe integrated climate change stress test presented in the following section complements the holistic qualitative risk assessment with quantitative information for a limited set of risks and risk transmission channels. It demonstrates our continuing efforts to build capabilities and capacities for quantitative climate change risk assessments and gain experience with sizing balance sheet exposures to climate change risks.\n\nThe stress test covers both sides of the balance sheet by measuring asset- or liability-specific stress impacts, as well as their dependencies for a static balance sheet. We take into account a period up to 2050, which is relevant both for the implementation of key political and business strategies linked to the Paris Climate Agreement and for the onset of increasing global warming and its negative consequences. Impacts are estimated for market stresses, as well as property-casualty and life/health underwriting stresses, using NGFS[1](#page-78-0)/IPCC[2](#page-78-1) scenario-based data from various sources. NGFS scenarios are selected for this analysis since they are compiled on behalf of central banks and supervisory authorities for financial stress testing, provide pathways for macroeconomic variables in a variety of scenarios representing different levels of transition and physical risk, and are available open source. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are the starting point of well-established scientific studies on the development of climate-related hazards in climate change scenarios, which can be adapted for modelling underwriting risks. All entities contributing to the Allianz Group's Solvency II model are in scope for the assessment. The main focus of the analysis is to provide a best estimate for market value balance sheet impacts.\n\nFor the current implementation of the integrated climate change stress test, we have considered five scenario narratives from the suite of NGFS reference scenarios. The (1) Net Zero 2050 scenario is determined by an orderly transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 following the target to limit global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies at the cost of moderate economic strain in the initial years. The (2) Below 2 °C scenario assumes an early and orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, with an unambitious policy target to limit global warming to below 2 °C by the end of the century. In this scenario, policy action has limited impact on economic growth. In the (3) Delayed Transition scenario, GHG emissions remain high until 2030, when strong policy measures are taken to limit warming to below 2 °C. Physical risks are relatively small in these scenarios over the 2050 time horizon.\n\nThe (4) Nationally Determined Contributions scenario includes all pledged climate policies, even if not yet implemented. However, these pledged policies are still insufficient to limit global warming to below 2 °C, leading to increasing physical risks. Accounting only for climate policies that were in place before 2019, the (5) Current Policies scenario is characterized by limited transition risks and high physical risks, which start to become more visible over the second half of the projection period.\n\nNGFS scenarios are used to obtain financial market variables for application in the market stress module of the integrated climate change stress test. The market stresses themselves are applied to market values of both assets and liabilities of in-scope entities, where a simplified approach is used to assess the mitigation of stress impacts due to policyholder profit sharing. Scenario variables used in the property-casualty and life/health underwriting stress modules are derived from hazard models that are contingent on the IPCC's RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. For the life/health underwriting stress module, stress variables are based on a study by Gasparrini et al.[3](#page-78-0) that projects temperature-related excess mortality under various heat and cold pathways and their net change up to the end of the century. The life/health underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of <span id=\"page-78-1\"></span><span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>liabilities for biometric risk exposure. The property-casualty underwriting stress module relies on projections for Average Annual Loss under RCP scenarios for a selection of the most climate changerelevant country and peril combinations (i.e., inland flooding, hail and tropical cyclone) developed by NatCat modeling experts at Allianz Re. The property-casualty underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for NatCat risk exposures.\n\nTo separate the impact of climate change risk from trend growth, stress levels are assessed relative to a baseline or counterfactual scenario as defined by the NGFS, a hypothetical scenario in which neither progression of climate change nor the implementation of transition measures is assumed. Furthermore, the calculation of stress impacts is based on instantaneous stresses on the static year-end 2023 balance sheet, without adaptation or mitigation actions from Allianz and its business partners. In particular, internal measures such as contract repricing, deployment of reinsurance strategies, or portfolio steering have not been taken into account, as well as external measures such as public investment in flood defences. Impact estimates from the different stress test modules are integrated based on a matching of global mean temperatures for 2050 between NGFS and IPCC scenarios as well as consideration of the overall scenario characteristics. No diversification between market stresses and underwriting stresses is assumed for the aggregation.\n\nImpact estimates from the integrated climate change stress test rely on scientific research and scenario data that is available and considered relevant as of the current point in time. Nevertheless, the magnitude of outcomes has to be treated with caution when accounting for the significant uncertainties inherent in climate change modeling and the crucial role of assumptions in long-term projections. These include, but are not limited to, uncertainties in the scientific studies underlying the projected distributions of NatCat events, uncertainties in the modeling of macroeconomic impacts of physical risks, as well as uncertainties due to the limitations of climate change scenarios in capturing environmental, social, and economic cascading effects or tipping points. Uncertainties around assumptions for the counterfactual scenario can also have a critical impact on results.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_NGFS: Network for Greening the Financial System. 2\\_IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of the aggregate market and property-casualty and life/health underwriting stress impacts, two key overarching observations may be derived. Firstly, with the exception of the Delayed Transition scenario, cumulative market value balance sheet impacts over the first 5-10 years of the projection period are largely determined by the different levels of transition risk in the scenarios, whereas impacts from physical risks are small in comparison but increase gradually. Secondly, market stress is the largest contributor to overall cumulative market value balance sheet impacts, exceeding the combined contribution from property-casualty and life/health underwriting stresses by a considerable margin.\n\nExpounding upon the above general observations at the individual scenario level, we note the following:\n\n- − Moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts are realized in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, where the initial economic strain subsides rapidly until 2030.\n- − The orderly implementation of the not too ambitious policy target in the Below 2 °C scenario comes with a low transition risk initially. While stress impacts in the long term in the Below 2 °C scenario are comparable to stress impacts in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, an overall negative trend compared to the 1.5 °C scenario is predicted in the second half of the century due to higher physical risk associated with higher mean temperatures.\n- − In the Delayed Transition scenario, very low stress impacts materialize in initial years, followed by high cumulative market value balance sheet impacts of (13.6) % after 2035 with the start of the delayed implementation of a policy ambition that is comparable to that in the Below 2 °C scenario. Economic recovery is rather slow in this scenario.\n- − Initial losses from transition risk in the Nationally Determined Contributions scenarios, comparable to losses in the Below 2 °C scenarios, turn into losses from physical risk in later years that gradually increase over time.\n- − In the absence of stringent climate policy implementation, stress impacts are relatively muted until the second half of the time horizon for the Current Policies scenario, similar to the Delayed Transition scenario, where stress impacts from physical risk phase in bringing about moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts of approximately (5.5) % in the long term. Beyond this period, both the Current Policies and the Nationally\n\nDetermined Contributions scenarios are expected to entail even more material losses as impacts from physical risks increase and outweigh transition risk impacts.\n\nAn excerpt from the aggregated stress test results is shown in table \"Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change\". The complete analysis covers the period from now until 2050, whereas the excerpt here shows the estimated maximum adverse impacts over the 5-20 year period, taking into account, amongst other considerations, that the current NGFS scenarios are primarily aimed at modeling long-term climateeconomic relationships.\n\n**Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change**\n\n%\n\n| Scenario                            | Long-term<br>5-20 years |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net Zero 2050                       | (2.8)                   |\n| Below 2 °C                          | (2.7)                   |\n| Delayed Transition                  | (13.6)                  |\n| Nationally Determined Contributions | (5.2)                   |\n| Current Policies                    | (5.5)                   |\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nIt is apparent from a review of the results of the qualitative risk assessment and consideration of potential risk responses that while some new mitigation measures (such as processes, controls, strategies) tailored to climate change may be necessary, the current risk management approaches are generally either adequate, or only require smaller modifications. For example, with respect to propertycasualty underwriting, well-established techniques such as premium adjustments, changes in coverages, exclusions, expansions, or revisions to risk limits can all be effectively utilized. Despite this conclusion, the consequences in areas where climate change is set to fundamentally transform insurance markets are less predictable and require strategic attention. Fundamental transformation includes aspects such as coverage affordability, the shrinkage of existing markets, or the emergence of new markets, as well as products or coverages encompassing difficult-to-price risks (e.g., similar to industry experience around the emergence of cyber insurance).\n\nFrom the quantitative perspective, the overall impact estimates derived from the integrated climate change stress test are considered to be within Allianz's risk tolerance, considering both the magnitude of predicted losses and the time horizon over which they materialize. Extending this analysis to a dynamic balance sheet view would further support this assessment; for example, accounting for risk mitigating management actions such as adaptation of derivatives hedging and reinsurance programs, repricing of insurance products, or strategic repositioning of investment and insurance portfolios. The approximate estimates we carried out on the effectiveness of selected management actions confirm this view.\n\nAddressing the immediate effects of climate policy implementation requires the incorporation of climate change-specific measures. These include long-term strategies aimed at aligning investment and insurance portfolios with climate policy targets, as formulated in our transition plan, see the section \"Transition plan & strategy\". However, successfully managing an economic crisis that may unfold as an indirect effect of climate policy implementation – e.g., in the Delayed Transition scenario – necessitates having well-established mitigation measures ready and operational, such as limiting or hedging equity and corporate bond exposures, or effective asset liability management.\n\nWe will continue to refine our climate change risk assessments in line with the evolving understanding of assessment methodologies and improving data availability and quality, while also accounting for a shifting climatic and political baseline.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Social matters\n\nThe following section describes the impact of social matters on our business activities and relationships, and the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships on society. We describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on social impact and responsible consumer/sales policies.\n\nAllianz is committed to having a positive social impact and helping to deliver the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). For further information on our commitment to the UN SDGs, please refer to the sections \"01.4\", \"01.5\" and \"04.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**. We understand social impact as the effect that our global organization has on the well-being of the community – from global society to local communities where we live and work. This ambition is lived out through our company purpose, our group-wide business strategy, and the local efforts of our operating entities.\n\nOur long-term approach as an investor and insurer is an opportunity to offer measures that can mitigate future risks and shape societies for generations; for example, through pension systems, environmental and climate protection. As a global insurer, we uphold the principle of solidarity. Pooling risks is part of our core business model and we have a keen interest in supporting stable communities. We have a role to play in enabling future generations and persons with disabilities to overcome the economic and social impacts of social risks.\n\n### **Tax transparency**\n\nAt Allianz, we are continuously engaging in tax transparency. We consider taxes to be a core component of corporate responsibility and sustainability.\n\nOur ambition is to take a responsible approach to the management of taxes. We aim for being recognized as a compliant, co-operative and reliable taxpayer in each country we operate. For a comprehensive description of our approach see our Group Tax Strategy on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_TTR_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nIn 2023, we have consolidated our tax transparency reporting products while keeping the same level of information. We are presenting our total tax contribution and our country-by-country reporting now in our Sustainability Report along with other information about current tax topics and developments.\n\n### **Corporate citizenship**\n\nWe are aware that our actions have the potential to influence the future living conditions, employability and well-being of young people and persons with disabilities and that our decisions play an integral part in determining this future.\n\nAllianz wants to shape its social impact in a meaningful and lasting way. This social impact stems from both the nature of our business and the effect that our global organization has on the wellbeing of the communities it is active in.\n\nWe view supporting and upskilling young people and persons with disabilities to help them get into education and employability as one way to contribute to SDGs, and in particular to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\nOur ambition is shaped by our company purpose, \"We secure your future\", defined by our group-wide business strategy, and brought to life through our employees and the local efforts of our operating entities (OE) who actively implement our Corporate Citizenship Strategy and strengthen its alignment with the SDG 8 but also with SDG 17 via philanthropic initiatives, global partnerships and volunteerism.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Social Impact Fund (SIF) which supports our OE's strategic opportunities by focusing on creating measurable impact through intersectoral partnerships.\n\nOn top of this social work and based on the lessons learned from existing partnerships with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Allianz has further developed a major global initiative: Move Now is a program that prepares our focus groups for their professional future by offering opportunities to move mentally and physically. It is an initiative that OEs can run in the countries we operate in and an initiative which we support financially with our SIF.\n\nFor MoveNow, the SIF picks up and leverages existing formats from the partnerships with the IOC and the IPC. In 2023, it provided resources for 18 local partnerships that focus on the goals of SDG 8. To further support its local entities in setting their ambitions and measuring and reporting on the impact of corporate citizenship activities at a local level, Allianz has introduced the Allianz Social Impact Measurement Framework.\n\nFor further information, please refer to section \"04.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n### **Objectives and actions: societal impact**\n\n| Topic                            | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate citizenship strategy   | Continue with the implementation of the new strategy and roll-out of the impact measurement<br>framework.                                                                                                                     | Integrated Social Impact Measurement Framework into data collection process to enhance input-<br>output-outcome-impact (IOOI) reporting in support of local entities setting their ambitions and<br>measuring the impact of corporate citizenship activities. |\n| Corporate citizenship activities | - Continue to contribute to society through corporate giving and employee volunteering in alignment<br>with our strategy.<br>- Identify and launch activities that would be supported through the Allianz Social Impact Fund. | Social Impact Fund supported 18 corporate citizenship programs led by operating entities (OEs) in<br>partnership with NGOs in delivery of social impact locally in alignment with global strategy.                                                            |\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Responsible consumer/sales\n\nOur strong reputation is built on the trust our customers, shareholders, employees, and the general public place in our integrity. This trust hinges on the quality of our products, information, and advice, and on the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and representatives.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our corporate culture. The Code emphasizes that fairness towards customers and transparent communication about our products and services – including their limitations – maximizes our opportunity to earn the long-term trust of customers. This is expressed through our Global Sales Compliance Framework program, which specifies standardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring, and review, and is regularly updated to reflect regulatory developments.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance aims to promote and protect the interests of our customers. It is designed to ensure transparency and the fair, honest, and responsible treatment of Allianz customers in their purchase of our financial products and their dealings with us. The Standard lays the foundation for a comprehensive customer protection framework designed to ensure all Allianz entities adhere to its prudential norms and robust protection. It covers five key areas to address conduct risk: Product Oversight and Governance, Incentives and Steering of Distributors, Standard of Distribution, Sales Force Selection and Training, and Monitoring and Reporting.\n\nWe use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score®(NPS) as our key metric for measuring customer loyalty through customers' willingness to recommend Allianz. In 2022, we switched to digital NPS tracking. The digital NPS paradigm allows us to measure customer loyalty continuously, eliminating seasonality and deepening our understanding of customers' sentiment. Additionally, the new measurement sets higher standards for our operating entities, which are measured against a broader set of competitors. This year, we achieved a remarkable NPS of 59% Loyalty Leadership across all our business segments. This result exceeds our target (50% loyalty leaders by 2024) and reinforces our position as a trusted and preferred insurance and financial service partner.\n\nOur Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic and standardized methodology to monitor and improve the customer experience by collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative feedback. Customers are invited to rate their satisfaction on a five-star scale after their recent experience at predefined touch points along five customer journeys. To this end, we map the main interactions a customer has with Allianz along the following journeys: Sales & Onboarding; Claims; Issue Resolution & Contract Management; Renewal, Cancelation & Termination; and Outbound Communication. If customers rate their experience with three stars or fewer, we follow up with them to resolve the issue directly and gather more insights.\n\nWe use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS to improve our products, services, communications, and processes. We combine and analyze sources of customer data in strict accordance with applicable privacy laws to prioritize and implement structural improvements. Local operating entities use customer feedback to derive concrete actions.\n\nFindings from the VoC and dNPS programs also help us design the global Allianz experience for our customers. In 2023, we continued our journey to co-create and scale one global Allianz customer experience by developing additional initiatives. Firstly, we continued to implement the Annual Policy Review initiative, which was launched in November 2022, as a way to engage with customers and discuss their insurance portfolio and current needs.\n\nSecondly, we worked together with the Allianz Behavioral Economics team to improve the policy renewal communication template by providing customers with more clarity and transparency. And thirdly, in June 2023, we launched a global Prewarning & Prevention initiative, focused on helping customers prevent damage to their property due to climate-related events. Working with climate scientists and risk experts across the Group, we co-created the Global Risk Assessment (GloRiA) tool and customer education assets, which enable users to learn more about the Nat Cat risks associated with their place of residence.\n\nThe Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end global business model that puts the customer at the center of our business and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable. Our ambition is to simplify and harmonize our business globally.\n\nWithin this context, the Allianz Customer Model was designed first for Retail Property and Casualty lines and then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, Large Corporate and Reinsurance.\n\nOur target has been to continuously roll out the model across Allianz operating entities. As of the second quarter of 2023, ACM has been rolled out to 39 operating entities, comprising 99% of gross written premium (GWP) for our retail Property and Casualty business.\n\nA tangible example of how the Allianz Customer Model is transforming our business is our Master Products. A Master Product is a template available in the Allianz Product Lab with streamlined product elements that are linked to harmonized claims and pricing values. Allianz OEs can configure Master Products to create the right product for their market and make adaptations that are required by regulation. So far, we have created 21 Property-Casualty Master Products which cover more than 90% of Property-Casualty GWP in our OEs (excluding global lines). Harmonized Master Products allow us to efficiently scale essential IT assets such as Quote & Buy and First Notification of Loss in the Business Master Platform. This platform digitalizes the business requirements of the ACM. It comprises a combination of scalable technological elements, systems and services plus functionalities and configurations, to better serve our customers, intermediaries, partners, and employees.\n\nThis involves transforming the whole value chain across products, sales, claims, and operations. Our aim is to continuously roll out the model across Allianz OEs.\n\nRather than selling individual insurance products, our vision is to evolve our products into full ecosystems and offer customers relevant and trusted solutions. In addition, we are using the ACM to upgrade customer journeys at the Group level.\n\nOur approach to customer responsibility and compliance is described in the section \"04.3\" of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Cybersecurity\n\nIn this section, we describe the impact of cybersecurity on our business activities and relationships, as well as the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships with regard to IT topics. In addition, we describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy, and data ethics.\n\nInformation security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from unauthorized access and against cyberattacks, and to meet related regulatory requirements. Our dedicated Information Security function aims to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information across the Allianz Group.\n\nAs a core business discipline, information security is managed globally through a robust and mature governance framework aligned with international standard ISO 27001. Our approach is closely monitored by a dedicated Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) function and the Allianz SE Board of Management. An executive accountability regime supports the enforcement of the governance framework for all entities.\n\nThe Allianz Information Security Governance Framework comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes. An overall policy establishes core principles, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the Information Technology and Information Security organizational framework within the Allianz Group.\n\nThe functional rules are complemented by detailed descriptions of best practices to be followed across 16 defined topics to ensure the \"'security by design\"' principle. Information security is regularly audited, both internally and externally, and regular training is provided through dedicated exercises across all layers of the organization.\n\nTo fulfill our commitment, cyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed along key risk indicators covering security maturity, risk exposure, and security operations across the Allianz Group. Performance against these indicators is discussed, reviewed, and reported quarterly to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. Monitoring for cyber incidents, and measures to prevent them from occurring, are implemented at a global level and supplemented locally where required, together with the local CISOs that exist in all Allianz operating entities.\n\nSpecific actions to improve security controls are continuously evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, riskbased view that is informed by the current and expected threat landscape. Actions to achieve our cyber risk targets focus on five key risk areas: reducing the likelihood of incidents; increasing the likelihood of detection; reducing damage from incidents; streamlining compliance; and training/educating the organization to further improve security awareness.\n\nAll employees are required to participate in cyber-awareness training at least quarterly. This training includes activities like simulated phishing e-mails, awareness campaigns, and dedicated information security training, with the latter being offered regularly. We also participate in industry and global/regional initiatives to support the security of the internet ecosystem as a whole.\n\nFurther information on our commitment to information security is described in the section \"05.1.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nProtecting personal data and maintaining trust in our processes are key priorities. Our customers, employees, and other stakeholders expect us to treat their data with the utmost care and we take this responsibility extremely seriously. We are committed to the highest standards to protect customer privacy and we work closely with other stakeholders involved in the update and modernization of European privacy legislation, including industry associations, members of parliament, and authorities. We also strive to communicate honestly and openly about actions that involve the personal data we process by publishing privacy notices that explain who we are, how we collect, share, and use personal data, and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights.\n\nOur group-wide privacy program ensures compliance with all relevant data privacy laws and regulations. All data privacy matters are overseen by Group Data Privacy.\n\nThe Allianz Privacy Standard (APS) is our global standard for data privacy and the foundation of the Allianz Privacy Framework. As the highest policy document in the Allianz Privacy Framework, the APS defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal data, including the ten privacy principles that all employees must respect wherever they are in the world:\n\n- 1. Due care.\n- 2. Data quality (purpose limitation, data minimization and storage limitation).\n- 3. Lawful basis (personal data is only processed if we have a lawful basis to do so).\n- 4. Transparency and openness towards employees and customers on where personal data is stored and used.\n- 5. Relationships with data processors (ensure organizations that process personal data on our behalf adhere to our privacy requirements).\n- 6. Adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred.\n- 7. Security and confidentiality (appropriate technical and organizational security safeguards are in place to protect personal data).\n- 8. Timely reporting of personal data breaches.\n- 9. Privacy by design and default.\n- 10. Cooperation with data protection authorities.\n\nIn addition to the APS, our data protection authority has approved our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which allow Allianz Group companies to lawfully transfer personal data from within the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it is required for business purposes.\n\nOur employees play a critical role in upholding our commitment to protect personal data. To ensure all our employees have the knowledge to properly use and safeguard personal data, they are required to complete annual privacy training. This training covers the Allianz Privacy Framework requirements in detail and provides a solid foundational understanding of core privacy concepts and the proper handling of personal data. For Privacy Experts, five-day Privacy Expert Training is focused on providing Data Privacy Professionals and Data Protection Officers with the practical knowledge to effectively conduct their day-to-day activities. For Privacy Champions, two-day Privacy Champion Training is focused on the practical knowledge and exercises required for the Privacy Champion role to ensure data protection compliance within the business.\n\nAs part of our Privacy Risk Management process, we identify and manage privacy risks at the operational process level to ensure they are measured, monitored, and mitigated across our core businesses. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of processes that use personal data – such as customer health data and employee data – enable the early identification of privacy risks and ensure they are managed appropriately. We also undertake case-by-case Transfer Impact \n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nAssessments (TIAs) for processes that transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to suppliers in third countries in order to confirm an adequate level of data privacy is maintained. We designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform, which was rolled out to all our operating entities in the EEA to ensure such assessments are conducted in a consistent, semi-automated way.\n\nIn committing to the highest standards of data protection, we believe the maintenance of a state-of-the-art privacy program needs to be supported by diligent and continuous monitoring and assurance activities. Privacy reviews require every operating entity, global line, and regional office to undergo a rigorous examination of the design, implementation, and effectiveness of its local privacy program and related process and controls. The frequency of these reviews is based on risk, but they are carried out at least once every five years. As of the end of 2023, we have conducted 22 privacy reviews, including joint reviews with Information Security and peer Data Protection Officers (DPOs). This is a 37% increase compared to 2022 and concludes the five-year privacy review cycle.\n\nFor further information on our commitment to data privacy, please refer to the section \"05.1.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website.](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**\n\nOur aim is to maintain stakeholder trust and position Allianz as a leader in conducting data-driven business in a trustworthy and ethical manner. This includes elevating data ethics as well as selected data and analytics-related topics in the governance and decision-making processes of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe strive for a responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our business activities based on a strong AI Governance Framework. This includes ensuring a human-centric approach in our usage of AI systems. For each AI system, an appropriate level of human control must be determined according to the inherent risks of harm for individuals as part of a Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment.\n\nEnsuring compliance with current and upcoming regulations and embedding best practices in anticipation of regulatory change are also high priorities in fulfilling our data ethics commitments.\n\nFollowing its establishment in 2021, the Data Advisory Board (DAB) has continued its work to elevate and integrate data ethics into governance and decision-making, as well as to support the positioning of Allianz as both a leading insurer and investor in the data ethics space and wider sustainability efforts. In 2023, the DAB monitored the final implementation of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI in OEs that are members of the Renewal Agenda Committee.\n\nFurthermore, emerging risks regarding generative AI have been addressed by dedicated guidelines in further development of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI. Training led by Group Privacy and Group Data Analytics has been expanded to target a broader employee base as well as employees who develop and/or use AI in applicable OEs.\n\nFor further information on our commitment to data ethics, please refer to the section \"05.1.3\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nWe are constantly developing our solutions to enable customers to manage cyber threats. As an example, Allianz (within its commercial Property-Casualty products) has eradicated around 98% of silent cyber exposure, therefore providing clarity to customers on what is and is not covered within the products. As an insurer, we combine policy and service improvements to help businesses understand the need to strengthen their controls. We continue to evolve cyber risk exposure coverage across Property-Casualty policies spanning commercial, corporate, and specialty insurance segments. The Cyber Underwriting Strategy addresses exposures to cyber risks and is reviewed regularly to ensure policies are updated and clarified in response to cyber risks.\n\nFor further information on cyber risk, please refer to the section \"05.1.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf) [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n### **Objectives and actions: cybersecurity**\n\n| Topic                                         | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Information security executive accountability | -

The Allianz Sustainability Board oversees human rights due diligence for the Allianz Group, while Global Sustainability seeks to continuously improve human rights related governance.\n\nThe human rights that Allianz is committed to respecting are those agreed by governments in:\n\n- − The International Bill of Human Rights: This consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.\n- − The core International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions: These include the prohibition of child labor and forced labor; freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; occupational health and safety; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nAllianz has been a member of the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002 and uses the UNGC principles to guide its business activities. These principles cover human rights, labor rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. For further information on Allianz's Communication on Progress, please refer to the **[UNGC website](https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/497-Allianz-SE)**.\n\nAllianz aims to identify, prevent, mitigate, or remediate adverse human rights impacts linked to our business activities and operations, including in our supply chain. Our approach is guided by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).\n\n### **Human rights in our own operations and supply chain**\n\nAllianz SE has been subject to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA) since 1 January 2023. GSCA applies to large companies based in Germany and their \"own business area\". The own business area of Allianz SE (as the holding company of the Allianz Group) encompasses all entities that are part of the Allianz System of Governance, irrespective of location. Therefore, our GSCA risk management covers all those Allianz entities and their suppliers worldwide.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the Allianz Policy Statement on Human Rights[1](#page-84-0) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-SE_Human-Rights-Policy-Statement-2023.pdf)**.\n\nAs part of GSCA implementation, Allianz has implemented further due diligence procedures that are appropriate to ensure that risks to the human rights of people working for Allianz or for our suppliers, and those whose human rights may otherwise be directly affected by the economic activities of Allianz or its suppliers are minimized, and that breaches are remedied promptly and adequately.\n\nAt the heart of our due diligence processes are annual and adhoc analyses of human rights risks in our own operations and supplier base worldwide. If risks are identified, we take appropriate measures to minimize them. If human rights violations are identified, we take immediate remedial action to address those violations, in line with our influence on respective suppliers.\n\nAllianz SE publishes an annual human rights policy statement and reports annually to the responsible regulator (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle) about our human rights due diligence.\n\nA Group Human Rights Officer was appointed in 2023 to monitor the effectiveness of our risk management systems in our own operations and supply chain worldwide.\n\nFor further information on our people and culture strategies, please refer to the section \"Employee matters\" and the section \"04.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects Allianz's values and principles and gives our employees guidance in their actions and decisions. At Allianz, we expect employees to support and adhere to human rights in alignment with international standards. For further information, please refer to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/code-of-conduct/en-Code-of-Conduct-AllianzGroup-2020.pdf)**.\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Further measures have been implemented to minimize risks to relevant human rights and labor standards in our own operations. These include:\n\n- − The protection of human rights has been enshrined in our internal corporate rules, depending on local laws and requirements.\n- − Anonymous feedback tools and surveys give our employees the opportunity to evaluate issues such as workload, wages, and diversity.\n- − Extensive measures have been put in place to ensure the physical safety of employees, as well as to improve their health and wellbeing.\n\nWe at Allianz expect all our suppliers to act with integrity and to respect the rights of their own employees and other people who may be affected by the supplier's business activities. These expectations are embedded in our **[Vendor Code of Conduct](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/Allianz_Vendor-Code-of-Conduct.pdf)** and **[Sustainable](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/AllianzSustainableProcurementCharter.pdf)  [Procurement Charter](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/AllianzSustainableProcurementCharter.pdf)**.\n\nAllianz has established a worldwide complaints mechanism that is open to Allianz employees, the employees of our suppliers, and other people whose rights might be impacted by Allianz's operations and business activities.\n\n### **Human rights in our business activities**\n\nAs a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence process forms part of our overall sustainability approach which is integrated into our broader risk management system.\n\nWe use a combination of sector and country-specific approaches to identify human rights risks.\n\nHuman rights-related due diligence has been integrated into all sensitive business areas where relevant, to ensure that human rights are part of the overall risk assessment for insurance and investments in non-listed asset classes.\n\nWe maintain a mandatory referral list for sensitive countries where systematic human rights violations occur. For business transactions located in these countries, we carry out explicit due diligence in accordance with our Human Rights Guideline that covers various human rights violations.\n\nWhen a human rights risk is identified by an underwriter or investment manager, a mandatory referral process starts for further\n\n1\\_As part of its human rights due diligence under the German Supply Chain Act (GSCA), Allianz SE publishes an annual Human Rights Policy Statement for the Allianz Group. This Statement covers our policies and due diligence approach on a wide range of human rights risks, including child labor, forced labor, and slavery. Until further regulatory clarification, Allianz will continue to publish, on the Allianz company website, an annual Modern Slavery Act Statement that complies with the relevant UK Act, even though the content is also covered in the GSCA Policy Statement.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\ndue diligence by sustainability experts and the involvement of central units such as the risk and communication departments.\n\nWhere an issue is detected and the (re)insurer/investor has leverage, engagement is encouraged to address and mitigate a potential human rights risk.\n\nIf no mitigation measures exist or if leverage cannot be increased, and the risk is determined to be unacceptable, Allianz declines to engage in the business transaction.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the **[Allianz Sustainability](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)  [Integration Framework](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)** and chapter \"02\" in our Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n#### **Objectives and actions: regulatory requirements**\n\n| Topic                      | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| German Supply<br>Chain Act | - Appropriate due diligence<br>processes for the own<br>operations and global<br>supply chain of Allianz SE,<br>with the objective to identify<br>and minimize human rights<br>risks and certain<br>environmental risks | -Risk analyses conducted in<br>own operations and supply<br>chain, using a risk-based<br>approach<br>- Group Human Rights Officer<br>monitored Allianz risk<br>management<br>- Human rights policy<br>statement published |\n\n## Employee matters\n\nAll employee mattersaremanagedby the People andCulture function at Allianz Group level and across all Allianz operating entities. The KPI tables in the following sections anticipate future CSRD requirements under ESRS S1 where applicable, indicated in the table name.\n\n\"We secure your future\" is our corporate purpose and living up to it starts with our 154,862[1](#page-85-0) (see table \"S1-6.1\") employees. Our Group People and Culture strategy is based on fulfilling this purpose and on our employer value proposition \"We care for tomorrow\", staying true to our brand promise of expressing confidence in tomorrow, and putting our customers at the center of what we do. This is what drives our decisions and actions and we do it in line with our people attributes: Entrepreneurship, Customer & Market Excellence, Trust, and Collaborative Leadership.\n\nOur ambition is to be the top employer in the financial services industry globally. We work to attract top talent and support our employees on their growth and development journey, delivering a strong business impact and making a positive social contribution wherever we operate.\n\nTo reach this ambition, we have based our People and Culture strategy on three pillars:\n\n- 1. The Employees and Candidates pillar includes all our strategic priorities that enable us to attract top talents and to engage, retain, and develop our employees. Strong employee engagement is important to us, and we foster a culture and working environment where people and performance matter. We ensure lifelong learning and are committed to growing and developing our people to be prepared for the future. Fair remuneration as well as health and safety for our employees are of utmost importance. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of flexible work options.\n- 2. The Business pillar includes our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) engagement and Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) initiative, which fuel our business to deliver on Allianz's strategic goals. We are committed to strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace by providing equal opportunities for all, fostering gender balance, and embracing a diverse workforce not only in terms of gender representation but also in terms of generations, disability, nationalities, ethnicities, religious beliefs, and LGBTQ+ identity. A diverse workforce enables us to better understand and fulfill the needs of our equally diverse customer base. Strategic Workforce Planning, on the other hand, aims to understand workforce development in response to global megatrends and how we can equip our workforce with the skills they need for today and for the future.\n- 3. The Brand and Society pillar displaysthe contribution our People and Culture function makes to business and society and that we create positive social impact. Our contribution is verified and acknowledged by external certificationslikeGreat Place toWork® (GPTW) and EDGE as well as global rankings like Refinitiv. Furthermore, we engage with the World Economic Forum, for instance, as a member of the Good Work Alliance for a more resilient,equitable, inclusive,andhumanefutureofwork.OurPeople\n\n<span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>and Culture operations contribute to generating sustainable and inclusive growth and help to deliver on U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 8, \"Decent work and Economic growth\".\n\nPolicies are instrumental in implementing our Group People and Culture strategy. We consider our established Allianz Corporate Rules as policies according to the ESRS' policy definition. At Allianz, we are committed to respecting the human rights outlined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the International Bill of Human Rights. Furthermore, Allianz explicitly supports the goal of observing and implementing the fundamental rights of these external charters. For further information, please refer to the section \"Compliance/anticorruption and bribery matters\",the section \"Collective bargaining and social dialogue\", and the section \"Human Rights in own workforce\".\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects our values and principles and thus guides our employees in their actions and decisions. How we act, how we operate, and the decisions that we make are focused on caring for each other and treating everyone fairly and with respect. The Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as the health and safety of our employees and clearly commits to a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination, bullying, or harassment. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the section \"Compliances/anti-corruption and bribery matters\".\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Human Resources (ASHR) establishes core rules and principles for People and Culture management, and it specifies the role of the respective Group People and Culture functions including professional, organizational, and procedural requirements. The People and Culture function is committed to these principles and acts as a service provider for the business. The Standard applies to the entire Allianz Group except Allianz Asset Management companies which are covered by separate standards aligning the general principles outlined in the ASHR. The following People and Culture topics are covered by the ASHR: Learning and development and performance management (for further information, please refer to the section \"Learning and development and performance management\")\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Contracted headcount working in companies fully covered under global People and Culture reporting standard.

The ASHR is reviewed once a year and considers interests of key stakeholders, particularly Allianz SE Group centers. Material changes must be approved by the respective Allianz SE Board Member in charge of People and Culture. The ASHR will be reviewed in 2024 and updated due to the requirements of CSRD and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, for instance.\n\nThe Allianz Group Remuneration Policy establishes the general and specific basic principles of the remuneration system. It defines processes related to performance evaluation, the remuneration system (including remuneration plans), and corresponding roles and responsibilities.\n\nCompliance with the Group Remuneration Policy is mandatory within the Allianz Group. The implementation of the policy is guided by the principle of proportionality, taking into account the nature of business, size, complexity, and regulation of the respective operating entity. This principle of proportionality only applies to the \"how\" and not to the \"if\" of the implementation.\n\nThe Group Remuneration Policy is reviewed once a year in accordance with the regulatory requirements under Solvency II and\n\n|                                                  | Employee matters section                               | Employee matters sub-section    | Targets and ambitions 20231                                                                                                            | Achievements1                                                                                                                                       | Targets and ambitions 20241                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1st Strategic Pillar<br>Employees/<br>Candidates | Engaging with our workforce                            | AES Survey                      | Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and<br>Work Well Index+ (WWI +) development<br>against previous year and overall ambition<br>level. | 81 % IMIX<br>76 % WWI +                                                                                                                             | Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) 75 % plus<br>and Work Well Index+ (WWI +)<br>development against previous year and<br>overall ambition level.                             |\n|                                                  | Learning and development and<br>performance management | Training and skills development |                                                                                                                                        | 50.01 hours/employee                                                                                                                                | 43 hours of learning on average per<br>employee p.a.                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                  |                                                        | Performance management          | 80 % of the Allianz executive2 population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan                                                    | 83.87 % of the Allianz executive2 population<br>with completed Personal Development Plan                                                            | 80 % of the Allianz executive population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan<br>60 % of the Allianz non-executive population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan |\n| 2nd Strategic Pillar<br>Business                 | Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)                 | Gender                          |                                                                                                                                        | Allianz Global Executives (AGE): 25.96 %<br>female<br>Allianz Senior Executives (ASE): 27.90 %<br>female<br>Allianz Executives (AE): 35.51 % female | Allianz Global Executives (AGE): 30 % female<br>Allianz Senior Executives (ASE): 30 % female<br>Allianz Executives (AE): 40 % female                                         |\n|                                                  |                                                        | Generations                     |                                                                                                                                        | 34.31 % employees < 35 years old                                                                                                                    | At least 25 % of our global workforce is                                                                                                                                     |\n\nStandards of Conduct, and membership of the Valuable 500.\n\napproved by the Allianz SE Board of Management.

Each operating entity concerned is obliged to provide a Statement of Accountability to the management of Allianz SE to confirm local implementation of the Group Remuneration Policy. Both the ASHR and the Group Remuneration Policy are published in the Allianz Corporate Rule Book. Our Allianz Functional Guidelines for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) describe our strategy, rationale, and principles for DEI. They show which targets and ambitions we have set ourselves, and how we implement and monitor those targets. In 2023, we published an update that includes our 2024 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion targets and ambitions. The Guidelines are applicable to the entire Allianz Group except Allianz Asset Management companies, which have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity. Our Functional Guidelines for DEI describe our commitments to the U.N. Women's Empowerment Principles, the U.N.

They have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity. 2\\_Liverpool Victoria General Insurance Group Limited, Guildford and Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited, Guildford are excluded from Allianz UK's data due to grading data unavailability for PDP.\n\nOur Allianz Global Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline outlines our global zero-tolerance standard against harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment) and discrimination. We encourage employees to speak up in line with our open communication and feedback culture and to use the Allianz Group's whistleblowing channels. For further information, please refer to the section \"Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\". To reflect important changes, both the Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI and the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline are updated by the respective departments and subsequently approved by the Group People and Culture Officer.\n\nAll mentioned policies are reviewed once a year. If one of the mentioned policies or single items within the policy are in conflict with local law or regulations, the local law or regulations will prevail.\n\nBeyond policies, it is crucial that targets and ambitions are implemented according to our Group People and Culture strategy.

This contracted headcount figure is the basis for the figures in the remainder of the section \"Employee matters\".\n\nThe metrics in the section \"Employee matters\" are collected centrally by Allianz Group People and Culture according to globally defined standards. Their definitions are documented in our People and Culture metrics definition handbook.\n\nThe split into the different business segments in tables \"S1-6.2\" and \"S1-6.4\" reflects the Allianz Group structure and ensures consistency throughout the report. For further information, please refer to [Business operations](#page-52-0) chapter. In addition, Germany as a country is displayed separately in accordance with CSRD requirements as it represents over 10% of the total contracted headcount.\n\nTable \"S1-6.3\" shows that the majority of our employees hold a permanent contract. Temporary contracts are sometimes offered to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made, to seasonal workers to meet customer demands, or to career entrants for summer internships in some operating entities. A minor part of our employees, for instance, those operating as medical professionals for Allianz or working students, are non-guaranteed hours employees. The majority of our active headcount are full-time employees, while some employees use the flexibility that Allianz offers to work part-time.

For further information, please refer to the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/ratings/business/human-rights.html)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/ratings/business/human-rights.html)**.\n\nAllianz SE, as the holding company of the Allianz Group, has been subject to the Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Act (GSCA)) since January 2023. The GSCA requires us to establish worldwide risk management systems concerning the human rights of our own employees and the employees of our suppliers, amongst others.\n\nIn our own operations, Allianz has established a risk management system that is designed to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks to the human rights of employees. Allianz will continue to further rollout and strengthen these processes over the course of 2024.\n\nAmong protected rights listed in the GSCA, the risk categories that are most relevant for our own operations are: occupational health and safety, equal treatment (which includes DEI and equal pay), freedom of association / collective bargaining, and adequate / living wages.\n\nIf risks are identified, we take preventive measures to mitigate those risks. If violations are found, Allianz is legally obliged to remedy them promptly. The effectiveness of measures is regularly reviewed.\n\nOur risk management system also encompasses an annual (public) [Policy Statement on Human Rights,](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-SE_Human-Rights-Policy-Statement-2023.pdf) a global complaints mechanism (**[SpeakUp@Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html)**), independent monitoring through the Group Human Rights Officer, and an annual (public) report to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control.\n\nThe section \"1st Strategic Pillar: Employees and Candidates\" outlines the topics engaging with own workforce, learning and development and performance management, fair remuneration, benefits, social protection, health and safety, work-life balance, and collective bargaining and social dialogue.\n\n### **Engaging with own workforce**\n\nListening and engaging with our employees are the cornerstones of implementing our People and Culture strategy. The member of the Board of Management responsible for People and Culture is accountable for developing our framework for listening to employees and steering activities to ensure progress towards implementation of our ambition and reaching our ambitions. Operational responsibility is assigned to the Global People and Culture Officer and Local Human Resources Directors. Our employee listening framework consists of the annual Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) and biannual Pulse surveys.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe AES is our well-established employee platform for gathering employee feedback globally and has been in place since 2010. Our two key indicators recorded with the survey are the Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and the Work Well Index+ (WWI +). The IMIX measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter, meaning that we enable employees to unlock their full potential. The IMIX score is derived out of a basket of ten questions. In 2023, the IMIX increased by 2 percentage points to 81% (2022: 79%). Improvements in our IMIX scores demonstrate that we are making progress in the areas of leadership, performance, and corporate culture.\n\nThe WWI + measures employee well-being. A higher index score is associated with higher employee well-being. The WWI+ score rose by +5pp to 76% (2022: 71%). For further information, please refer to the section [\"Health and safety\".](#page-91-0)\n\nThese positive 2023 results were achieved against the backdrop of deteriorating scores of external global benchmarks. We consider these good results to be a positive reflection of our ongoing follow-up activity in the aftermath of the survey and our efforts to continuously enhance the employee experience. Each Allianz entity thoroughly analyzes its results to gain an in-depth insight and agree on effective action plans with their teams. In addition, we expanded our global Engagement Matters program in 2023. This initiative provides frameworks of measures to increase employee engagement, offering support to all entities in identifying initiatives to implement on a global and local level in response to the feedback received. The focus areas identified are connected locally and globally so that Allianz operating entities can work on impactful measures.\n\nThe AES results are directly linked to the performance targets of the Allianz Board of Management. We aim to achieve an IMIX score above 75%and WWI+ development against previous year and overall ambition level in 2024.\n\nOur global Pulse surveys constitute the second employee listening channel. Pulse surveys took place in the first and second quarters of 2023 to check the impact of engagement plans and ask our employees about focus topics including Sustainability, Health and Safety, Personal Development and Risk Culture.\n\nOur efforts in engaging with our employees have been recognized with awards and certifications. In 2023, we proudly achieved GPTW certifications at 43 entities across 26 countries, marking a substantial leap from 15 entities certified in 2022. Allianz also reached a commendable 82% in the Trust Index and further narrowed the gap to the 86% score required for Top 25 World's Best Workplaces. Moving forward, our ambition is to increase the number of GPTW-certified entities as well as the number of OEs on the National Best Workplace lists.\n\nFor further information on our processes for engaging with our workforce, please refer to the section [\"Collective bargaining and social](#page-92-0)  [dialogue\"](#page-92-0).\n\n### **Learning and development and performance management**\n\nThis section addresses the strategic sub-section Training and skills development including Performance management.\n\n#### **Training and skills development**\n\nLearning and development is a key differentiator in the financial services industry where customer need are constantly changing in response to a rapidly evolving external context, as observed in various industries. Our ambition is for employees to develop skills for today and for the future to ensure Allianz is prepared for emerging trends and opportunities and able to attract the best talent.\n\nAllianz fosters personal, professional, and leadership skills, as well as digital skills and technical expertise, and emphasizes the development of EQ (emotional quotient, such as curiosity, resilience, \"we mentality\", and flexibility) as well as IQ (intelligence quotient, such as digital and data, problem-solving and business, sustainability, and leadership) skills. Allianz is committed globally to employee lifelong learning and development.\n\nTo live up to this commitment, we offer global learning through our global #learn initiative. We have set up programs targeted to key areas, such as property and casualty, life and health, IT, strategy, finance, sustainability, communications, market management, and operations. Allianz operating entities have access to global and local offers as part of their broader action plans to support employee learning and development.\n\nA special focus in 2023 was put on the topics of IT, data, and artificial intelligence. We offered generative AI and ChatGPT training to all managers with the aim of explaining the new technology to Allianz leaders and in order to develop relevant use cases for Allianz. More than a thousand managers took part in the training between October and December 2023. Additionally, we held the inaugural global Fit4IT day in 40 operating entities, covering approximately 85% of employees. Our employees were able to invest half a day in upskilling, familiarizing themselves with various IT tools.\n\nWe are also proud of our Allianz Sustainability Training for all our employees which covers the basics on sustainability – why it is important and what Allianz is doing to integrate sustainability into our business model – and offers inspiration on how employees can contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nWe employ a wide range of learning and development approaches including on-the-job learning, mentoring and coaching, classroom trainings, peer circles, and digital learning. We encourage employee learning in all formats, and all are included in the learning hours reported. The total hours reported in table \"S1-13.1\" thusinclude self-directed learning (such as videos and podcasts) as well as other, alternative, learning formats (such as coaching), which together account for 32.08% of total learning hours.\n\nWe have a strong focus on digital learning. Through our digital learning ecosystem, employees are able to source learning both from our AllianzU learning platform powered by Degreed and LinkedIn Learning. Our internally developed global learning offers are available in five languages and are available to all employees. Learning consumption is measured globally on a monthly basis.\n\nDeveloping our leaders is of the utmost importance to us. We run five global programs every year to develop strong leaders:\n\n- − #lead Ignite is targeted at new people leaders who qualify as potential or new Allianz executives. It aims to equip them with the knowledge, mindset, and skills needed to lead at Allianz.\n- − #lead Empower develops the leadership capabilities needed for leaders at the future and recently identified Allianz Senior Executive level to make the transition from leading teams to leading leaders and the business.\n- − #lead Transform was created for future and recently appointed top executives. The program is built around our core #lead mindsets: curiosity, resilience, \"we-mentality\", and flexibility.\n- − #lead Accelerator prepares future and current board members for leading the organization with strategic project work, board exposure, peer coaching, and external insights.\n- − #sheleads sets the standard for effective gender balance via sponsorship, peer coaching, and learning sessions with our alumni community. The program enables our female leaders to make their next career move.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the global programs, all leaders are encouraged to obtain the Allianz Leadership Passport, which is the \"license\" to be a people leader at Allianz globally. The program sets minimum standards for all people leaders, with an equal focus on hard and soft skills, for our leaders to balance IQ and EQ. After obtaining their Leadership Passport, leaders must refresh their passports on a yearly basis by undertaking further training. Monitoring and reporting on the take up of the #lead passport as well as the five global programs is managed globally by Group People and Culture. We monitor usage and learning consumption on a monthly basis.\n\nTo achieve our commitment to employee lifelong learning, Allianz set the global target of a yearly minimum average of 43 hours of training per employee by 2024. In 2023, our employees learned on average for 50.01 hours, as reported in table \"S1-13.1\". Additionally, a commitment to lifelong learning is included in the Board of Management targets for 2024. To support strong performance in current and future responsibilities, employee upskilling and development, we offer them a minimum of one hour working time per week dedicated to training.\n\nThe training hours per employee metric is monitored on a quarterly basis.\n\n#### **Average training hours per employee, broken down by gender (S1-13.1)**\n\n| As of 31 December               | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------|-------|\n| Average training hours1         | 50.01 |\n| Female                          | 47.52 |\n| Male                            | 52.67 |\n| Not reported as female or male2 | 69.99 |\n\n1\\_Calculated as a ratio of total training hours divided by active headcount. 2\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n#### **Performance management**\n\nAt Allianz, we are committed to developing and growing our people, including through performance management. Our performance management aims both to enhance the employees' individual performance and to align their priorities with Allianz's corporate purpose and strategic business goals. Setting priorities properly and conducting regular check-ins enables employees to let their full potential unfold, which in turn helps Allianz achieve its business ambitions. Performance management is an ongoing, continuous process of communicating on-the-job priorities, performance expectations, and development goals.\n\nThe framework for Performance Management is implemented within the Allianz Group, documented in the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe global People and Culture template on our leading People and Culture IT system enables the consistent application of the key steps making up the performance management cycle. The template is available to both the executive and non-executive employee populations. Execution and outcomes of the Performance Management process are subject to local legal regulations and respective governance bodies, e.g., local or global Compensation Committees.\n\nThe key steps of the Performance Management Process at Allianz can be described as follows:\n\n- − Priority setting is the initial kick-off of the annual performance management cycle and refers to setting clear, transparent, outcome-oriented, and flexible goals to be achieved throughout the year while giving guidance on desired behaviors.\n- − Mid-year check-in is the time to request and provide feedback for the first half of the year. Line manager and employee reflect on priorities and behaviors, and agree on joint measures to continuously improve performance through development opportunities on the job and off the job. Mid-year check-in is supported by our Multi-Rater feedback process. The Multi-Rater feedback is a tool for getting 360-degree feedback from colleagues. It is mandatory for Allianz's executive population, whereas implementation for the non-executive population is subject to the local rules and regulations of our operating entities. Based on the \"People Attributes\", Multi-Rater provides employees with valuable insights into their strengths and developmental areas.\n- − The Personal Development Plan (PDP) lays out the employee's yearly development goals. Employees are expected to agree with their manager on their individual development measures, usually during the mid-year review discussion. The PDP helps the employee record and track progress towards their own development goals. The 2023 target of 80% PDP completion by the Allianz executive population was achieved, as displayed in table \"S1-13.2\". The same target is set for 2024. For the Allianz non-executive population, the 2024 target is a 60% PDP completion rate.\n- − Year-End-Review is the assessment of individual performance of an employee by the line manager at the end of each year. The assessment is based on a 3-point rating scale: below, at, or above\n\ntarget. The overall individual performance of an employee is reflected in the Individual Performance Assessment.\n\n- − Performance and Talent Dialogue is a calibration of an employee's individual performance on the basis of crosscomparison within the relevant population. This ensures the application of consistent performance standards and an appropriate level of differentiation with close attention to nondiscrimination of employees in any regard.\n- − Communication of final Individual Performance Assessment is the feedback discussion between the line manager and employee, which normally takes place in 1Q of the following year and seeks a common understanding of accomplishments and development opportunities.\n\n#### **Allianz Executives and levels above3,4 (AE+) with a Personal Development Plan (PDP), broken down by gender (S1-13.2)** in %\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2023  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                                                  |       |\n| Executives with a PDP1                                                                                             | 83.87 |\n| % of male executives with a PDP out of all male executives                                                         | 83.31 |\n| % of female executives with a PDP out of all female executives                                                     | 84.94 |\n| % of not reported as female or male executives with a PDP out of<br>all executives not reported as female or male2 | -     |\n\n1\\_Includes all executive positions (Allianz Global Executive Positions, Allianz Senior Executive Positions, and Allianz Executive Positions).\n\n2\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n3\\_Allianz Asset Management companies excluded from global reporting of AE and ASE cluster as Allianz Global Grading System is not applicable to them.\n\n4\\_Liverpool Victoria General Insurance Group Limited, Guildford and Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited, Guildford are excluded from Allianz UK's data due to grading data unavailability for PDP.\n\n### **Fair remuneration, benefits, and social protection**\n\nThis section summarizes the topic of Adequate Wages and outlines the strategic topic Fair remuneration. Furthermore, we will address the topics Benefits and Social Protection.\n\n#### **Adequate wages**\n\nIn accordance with the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy, internal and external benchmarking is performed to ensure appropriateness of (individual) remuneration and general pay levels. Allianz expects all operating entities to follow the principles described in the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Fair remuneration**\n\nAllianz is committed to equity and fairness as defined in our Allianz Group Code of Conduct. This includes ensuring Allianz operating entities enforce equal pay for equal work in the same or comparable roles for all genders. This principle is outlined in our Allianz Group Remuneration Policy. An annual global equal pay review across the organization identifies equal pay gaps which can be mitigated with appropriate action.\n\nIn addition to equal pay, there is also a gender pay gap to be considered. This consists of the difference in average remuneration between men and women across a whole organization, irrespective of role or seniority. If one gender is more represented in higher paid, senior roles in one organization, for example, there will be a gender pay gap. Allianz takes several actions to foster gender equity in representation and thus close the gender pay gap. One important action is the ambition to have higher female representation in senior positions. To reach our gender representation targets, we monitor the percentage of our female employees on a quarterly basis and implement concrete actions towards target achievement. We also foster best practice exchange among operating entities to drive gender equality in representation (see also the section \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\").\n\nTo measure our progress towards equity and fairness and to continue to move forward on our journey, in 2021 we launched the EDGE (Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) certification process for our insurance business segment and several global lines, currently covering 73% of the Allianz Group's global headcount. EDGE is the leading standard for diversity, equity, and inclusion and monitors companies' progress on gender equality against established criteria, including equal pay. We are proud that Allianz has been recertified by EDGE in 2023.\n\n#### **Benefits**\n\nReward and recognition at Allianz go beyond remuneration. Allianz also supports its employees around the world with attractive benefits. This shows that we care about employees' Health, Money, Career, and Time and support them to find professional and personal fulfillment.\n\nOur Global Benefits Strategy for the insurance business is structured around these four pillars. We introduced minimum standards for benefits available to employees across Allianz in 1Q 2023, and we expect our global rebranding and communication campaign to further increase the transparency and visibility of Allianz benefits among employees in 2024.\n\nBenefits take economic, environmental, and social factors into account, and incentives are oriented towards creating long-term value and financial protection. The Allianz Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) for instance offers employees Allianz shares at favorable conditions in 43 countries, allowing them to benefit from the success of the company and its long-term performance. As a token of appreciation for meeting previous year Group targets, Allianz offered one Allianz Free Share – or its cash equivalent in countries that do not offer the ESPP – to employees globally in 2023.\n\nFor further information on employee benefits, please refer to our **[People Fact Book 2023](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)** and our **[Global recruiting homepage](https://careers.allianz.com/)**.\n\n#### **Social protection**\n\nWe operate in countries where our employees have at least access to social protection programs against loss of income due to major life events: sickness, unemployment, employment injury, parental leave, and retirement. In countries where social protection is not provided through public social security schemes, we aim to close potential gaps through additional offerings. Best practice examples are our entities in the United States, where Allianz provides health insurance benefits, or India, where we provide paternity, and carer leave options.[1](#page-91-1)\n\n### <span id=\"page-91-0\"></span>**Health and safety**\n\nThe health, safety, physical, and mental well-being of our employees is a top priority. We aim to sustain and improve employee health and well-being across our global workforce. Two key levers to achieve this ambition are our Minimum Health Requirements and our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system.\n\nThe four Minimum Health Requirements are:\n\n- <span id=\"page-91-1\"></span>1. Professional Support: Allianz offers employees 24/7 free of charge access to professional psychological support through Employee Assistance Programs.\n- 2. Leadership Enablement: Allianz offers targeted health and wellbeing training for people leaders, through both the #lead program and other platforms to ensure managers are equipped with the knowledge to sustain employee health and well-being as well as to strengthen resilience in their teams.\n- 3. Employee Feedback: Employees have the opportunity to give once a year feedback on their health and well-being through global surveys, such as Pulse surveys. For further information, please refer to the section \"Engaging with own workforce\".\n- 4. Focus Time: Meeting-free calendar days have been introduced to provide most employees with time to focus on their work.\n\nThe four Minimum Health Requirements are reinforced by the \"Agreement on Guidelines concerning Work Related Stress and Minimum Health Requirements\" between the Allianz SE and the (European) SE Works Council of Allianz SE. It applies to Allianz SE and its subsidiaries with registered offices in the Member States of the E.U., the contracting states of the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland. All best endeavors will be made to adopt the minimum health requirements across the Allianz Group, where national legislation does not prevent this.\n\nThe minimum health requirements were monitored regularly and reported to both management and employee representatives once a year, which shows our commitment to the well-being of our global workforce.\n\nTo effectively manage OHS matters, most local Allianz entities have furthermore implemented OHS management systems. They include OHS risk and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to mitigate these risks as well as emergency actions. Internal inspections take place frequently and progress in reducing and preventing health issues and risks is assessed against targets on a regular basis. This includes procedures to investigate work-related injuries, ill health, diseases, and incidents. Our workforce is trained regularly to raise awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents.\n\nThe health and safety of our global workforce is measured via our Work Well Index+ (WWI +) and other KPIs.\n\n1\\_The following major exceptions apply: Unemployment benefits are not available for non-citizens in Malaysia and Taiwan who are usually expats covered by their home countries' social welfare benefits. In a few countries, unemployment benefits are excluded in case of self-termination of work contract, for example in Croatia or in Türkiye. In Singapore and Hong Kong unemployment benefits are generally not part of the social security system.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Work Well Index+: To track well-being globally, we refer to the WWI+ index, which monitors the progress of health and well-being throughout the organization. We also use pulse check surveys to check in with employees during the year. For further information, please refer to the section \"Engaging with own workforce\".\n- − Regular monitoring of further health and safety indicators: Local Employee Assistance Program providers perform quarterly monitoring of additional indicators, which are reported to the Allianz Board of Management on a semiannual basis. Finally, CSRD-compliant KPIs, covering work-related injuries, ill health, accidents, fatalities, and days lost (see table S1-14) are monitored annually and serve as a point of reference for the health, safety, and well-being of our global workforce.\n\n#### **Health and safety (S1-14)**\n\n|                                                                                      | Unit                             | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                    |                                  |        |\n| Number of fatalities related to work-related<br>injuries/ill health                  | #                                | 1      |\n| Number of recordable work-related accidents                                          | #                                | 842    |\n| Rate of recordable work-related accidents                                            | Per one<br>million<br>work hours | 3.72   |\n| Cases of recordable work-related ill health¹                                         | #                                | 355    |\n| Number of days lost to work-related injuries/<br>fatalities/ accidents/ ill health¹² | #                                | 16,665 |\n|                                                                                      |                                  |        |\n\n1\\_The data of reporting unit Allianz Partners Service is not included in cases of recordable workrelated ill-health and number of days lost to work-related injuries/fatalities/accidents/ill health. 2\\_Globally, where national legislation or local culture/ norms do not prevent this.\n\n### **Work-life balance**\n\nThis section covers Flexible working options and the Family-related leave topic.\n\n### **Flexible working**\n\nAllianz offers a wide range of offerings. For us, hybrid working combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of mobile working with the benefits of targeted collaboration and in-person connection. Flexible work options are key for talent attraction and employee engagement, while regular in-person touch points help us foster team spirit, co-creation, and cross-team exchange.\n\nMost of our employees across the globe have the opportunity to spend a minimum of 40% of their working hours working from outside the office. Our global minimum offering provides a lot of empowerment, trust, and flexibility to our local teams to decide what works best for their customers, their business, and their teams. The flexible work offerings therefore differ in our operating entities but for all of them customer centricity and customer needs are the north star.\n\nWe track the actual employee time that was spent working outside the Allianz offices on a biannual basis and collect employee feedback in our AES survey. The survey results show that flexible work has been one of the positive drivers for employee engagement in 2023.\n\nFor further information on further flexible work options, please refer to our People Fact Book 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### **Family-related leave**\n\nBeing a parent and caring for family members are important responsibilities. Our Allianz employees deserve support in fulfilling these roles and keeping a positive work-life balance. Allianz is committed to supporting parents and families by offering childcare facilities, leisure activities, emergency assistance, and other family services. Family-related leave is specific to countries and usually covers maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers' leave. Allianz adheres to all statutory requirements in the countries we operate in and aims to exceed those standards where possible and appropriate.\n\n#### **Work-life balance metrics (S1-15)**\n\nIn %\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                      | 2023  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Employees entitled to take family-related leave (share of total<br>employees)          | 99.00 |\n| Employees that took family-related leave (share of entitled<br>employees)              | 8.50  |\n| Male (share of employees that took family-related leave)                               | 32.78 |\n| Female (share of employees that took family-related leave)                             | 67.00 |\n| Not reported as female or male (share of employees that took<br>family-related leave)1 | 0.10  |\n| 1 Comprises non-binary and not reported.                                               |       |\n\n### <span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>**Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue**\n\nWe aim to ensure that employee rights are protected across all Allianz operating entities. Allianz was one of the first companies to create pan-European worker participation standards and to establish a European SE Works Council under the legislation for Societas Europaea (SE) companies (an agreement concerning the participation of employees in Allianz SE).\n\nThrough this body and the regular dialogue between management and employee representatives and their trade unions, Allianz ensures effective representation of all its employees at European level. Our (European) Works Council Executive Committee is evidence that Allianz endorses the establishment of employee representatives in its Group companies and welcomes their cooperation with the trade unions.\n\nEmployee representation is widespread across Europe. The right of workers to establish workers' representative bodies and thus negotiate working conditions is guaranteed by law in many jurisdictions. The mandate of workers' representatives and the role of the employer in regard to collective bargaining and the social dialogue is very much shaped by local legal requirements.\n\nAllianz supports the principles enshrined in the ILO (International Labour Organization) core conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. In countries where those principles have been enshrined in local law, we fully respect and implement local rules on trade unions and worker representation. In countries that have not ratified the relevant ILO conventions, we respect the primacy of local laws and look for ways to allow our employees to organize and voice their interests vis-à-vis management. Globally, the percentage of Allianz's workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements is 48.46%.\n\nAccording to CSRD reporting requirements, \"coverage\" includes the number of employees to whom the companies concerned are obliged to apply the collective agreements. Irrespective of the obligation, there are a large number of companies that apply the collective agreements and provisions on a voluntary basis.\n\nWe work closely with employee representatives (members of the (European) SE Works Council's Executive Committee and employee representatives on the supervisory board of Allianz SE) to support change implementation, manage impacts on employees, and promote opportunities. The \"social dialogue\" is our pan-European forum that has existed for over a decade. It supports the progress of our business strategy, our agenda, and our response to the increased pace of change in topics such as the digital revolution. Discussions in 2023 included the [Strategic Workforce Planning](#page-94-0) program.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue (S1-8)**\n\n| Collective Bargaining Coverage |                  |                                                                                                       | Social Dialogue                            |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Coverage<br>Rate               | Employees - EEA1 | Employees -<br>Non-EEA2                                                                               | Workplace<br>representation<br>(EEA only)1 |\n| 0-19 %                         | -                | Corporate and<br>Other3                                                                               | -                                          |\n| 20-39 %                        | -                | Asia Pacific                                                                                          | -                                          |\n| 40-59 %                        | -                | Global Insurance<br>Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia &<br>Latin America,<br>Middle East and<br>Africa | -                                          |\n| 60-79 %                        | Germany4         | -                                                                                                     | -                                          |\n| 80-100 %                       | -                | -                                                                                                     | Germany4                                   |\n\n1\\_For countries with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n\n2\\_For business segments with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n\n3\\_For further information on Corporate and Other (incl.

We further describe the Strategic Workforce Planning topic.\n\n### **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**\n\nDiversity is a core element of our culture. Our customers are diverse, and in order to best understand and serve them, our workforce needs to be diverse, too. We believe that diverse teams create better results, show higher resilience, and are more innovative and more productive, provided they can act in an environment where everyone can be themselves and unique views are appreciated. Being both diverse and inclusive has a positive impact on our business.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening inclusion in our workplace, by ensuring equal opportunities for all, and shaping a diverse workforce along five DEI dimensions: gender, people with disabilities, nationalities/ethnicities, generations, and LGBTQ+. With our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI and our Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline, we aim to ensure that across our operating entities and functions there is no discrimination for reasons including gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, physical or mental abilities, religious beliefs, or social background.\n\nAt Allianz, we want to achieve our targets and ambitions for our DEI dimensions in a sustainable manner. The key to this is an inclusive workplace environment. We have multiple actions in place to strengthen our inclusive workplace environment, such as:\n\n- − Global Inclusion Council: Our Global Inclusion Council (GIC) sets the DEI strategy and plays a crucial role in driving initiatives to achieve our targets and ambitions, in integrating DEI into the business and monitoring progress. The GIC has been in place since 2007 and consists of more than 20 Allianz senior managers from operating entities, Allianz Group Center representatives, and the leads of our five global employee networks for DEI which leads to 81 local network chapters.\n- − DEI Employee Networks: Employee networks enable us to engage with our employees. They help us to raise awareness, support employees, advocate for change, and shape the agenda for DEI. We have five global employee networks: \"Allianz NEO\" for gender inclusion, \"Allianz Beyond\" for disability inclusion, \"Allianz GRACE\" for ethnicity and cultural inclusion, \"Allianz Engage\" for generational inclusion, and \"Allianz Pride\" for LGBTQ+ inclusion. 15 new networks operating locally were added in 2023.\n- − DEI as part of daily business Mentoring Campaign: At Allianz, DEI is integrated into the way we conduct business. Our global Mentoring Campaign #KeepExploring, which took place throughout 2023, championed an intersectional approach featuring personal experiences of employees presenting more than one diversity dimension, e.g. combining different generations with nationalities, and/or genders.\n\nGlobal People and Culture monitor the development of our targets and ambitions on a regular basis and report progress to the Allianz Board of Management on a semi-annual basis (for gender, this is done on a quarterly basis). Additionally, we support operating entities in setting up their individual local action plans to reach DEI targets and foster best practice exchange.\n\nThe achievements of our DEI strategy are recognized by external global awards and rankings. For example, Refinitiv – a global Diversity and Inclusion Index – identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies <span id=\"page-93-0\"></span>with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces. In 2023, Allianz was ranked #1 in the Insurance industry and #1 in Germany across all industries. Our reputation as a DEI leader strengthens Allianz's brand as a trusted provider of financial services.\n\nFor further information on DEI targets and ambitions, see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### **Gender**\n\nAt Allianz, we have already attained overall numerical gender parity in our workforce with 80,949 female and 73,884 male employees. We are committed to equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, and put measures in place to see this reflected in the staffing of leadership positions. As outlined in our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI[1](#page-93-0), our 2024 targets are to have 30% women in Allianz Global Executive positions, and 30% women in Allianz Senior Executive positions. In addition, we aim to have 40% women in Allianz Executive positions and 50% women in our talent pools. For further information, please refer to section the \"Fair remuneration\". Allianz NEO, our employee network for gender inclusion currently has 20 local networks in place. Allianz NEO focuses on helping to find concrete improvement opportunities, creating dialogue and allyship, and endorsing new perspectives and novel working models for both women and men.\n\n#### **Generations**\n\nWith five different generations currently working together at Allianz, we are committed to leveraging the combined strengths, individual skills, and experiences of all generations. We aim to have a balanced generational representation, where GenZ and GenY (employees under 35) represent at least 25% of our global workforce. As of the end of 2023, 34.31% of our global workforce (see table S1-9.2) is younger than 35, which ensures a balanced generational representation.\n\nOur efforts for age inclusion are strongly supported by Allianz Engage, our employee network for generational diversity with 11 local networks in place. Through Allianz Engage, our employees are invited to proactively contribute to a company culture where the knowledge of all generations is called upon, for example, through mentoring. In the AllianzGroup, we have more than 700 mutual mentoring arrangements in place, allowing people from different generations to enter into mentoring partnerships to connect and to share knowledge, experiences, skills and perspectives in a genuine learning exchange beneficial for everyone involved.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_The Guidelines including any targets stated therein do not apply to Allianz Asset Management companies, which have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (S1-9.1)**\n\n| As of 31 December                            | 2023  |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                              | #     | %     |\n| Gender distribution                          | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz SE Supervisory Board              | 12    | -     |\n| Male                                         | 7     | 58.33 |\n| Female                                       | 5     | 41.67 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz SE Board of Management            | 9     | -     |\n| Male                                         | 6     | 66.67 |\n| Female                                       | 3     | 33.33 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Executive positions (top management)2     | 6,788 | -     |\n| Male                                         | 4,461 | 65.72 |\n| Female                                       | 2,327 | 34.28 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Global Executive (AGE) positions  | 235   | 3.46  |\n| Male                                         | 174   | 74.04 |\n| Female                                       | 61    | 25.96 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Senior Executive (ASE) positions3 | 803   | 11.83 |\n| Male                                         | 579   | 72.10 |\n| Female                                       | 224   | 27.90 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Executive (AE) positions3         | 5,750 | 84.71 |\n| Male                                         | 3,708 | 64.49 |\n| Female                                       | 2,042 | 35.51 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n\n1\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n2\\_Includes all executive positions (Allianz Global Executive Positions, Allianz Senior Executive Positions, and Allianz Executive Positions).\n\n3\\_Allianz Asset Management companies excluded from global reporting of AE and ASE cluster as Allianz Global Grading System is not applicable to them.\n\n### **Age distribution (S1-9.2)**\n\n| As of 31 December                  | 2023   |       |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n|                                    | #      | %     |\n| Age distribution1                  |        |       |\n| Share of employees < 30 years old  | 28,757 | 19.13 |\n| Share of employees 30-50 years old | 82,598 | 54.93 |\n| Share of employees > 50 years old  | 39,004 | 25.94 |\n| Share of employees < 35 years old  | 51,595 | 34.30 |\n\n1\\_Age distribution is calculated based on active headcount, excluding, e.g., employees with a dormant employment relationship (for example due to sabbatical leave, in military or civilian service, or on parental leave).\n\n### **Persons with disabilities**\n\nAllianz Functional Guidelines for DEI explicitly outline that we prioritize the well-being of all our employees and work hard to ensure that our processes and workplaces are equally accessible to everyone, irrespective of their disability status.\n\nAllianz Beyond, our employee network for disability inclusion, currently has 12 local networks in place, with three local networks launched in 2023. It focuses on raising awareness of disability inclusion, identifying ways to make Allianz more accessible (physically and digitally). It also aims at creating a safe space for employees to disclose their disability and voice their workplace assistance needs in order to perform at their best. And it promotes Allianz externally as an attractive employer for people with disabilities.\n\nAllianz has been a Valuable 500 member since 2020 and is committed to increasing transparency on disabilities in the corporate landscape through increased disclosure. As an Iconic Leader, Allianz played a crucial role in the identification and definition of five Valuable 500 Disability Inclusion KPIs. These were announced at the World Economic Forum in 2023 and cover five dimensions: Workforce Representation, Goals, Training, Employee Resource Groups, and Digital Accessibility. Allianz reports on the Valuable 500 Disability Inclusion KPIs in our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)** and is working with Valuable 500 to secure commitment from other members to disclose Disability Inclusion KPIs and ultimately grant people with disabilities more equity in the workplace.\n\nAllianz has been a trusted partner of the Paralympic Movement since 2006 and became the first international partner of the International Paralympics Committee (IPC) in 2011. Through our continuous support, we recognize the athleticism and professionalism of Paralympians. Our efforts have a positive impact on career opportunities for people with disabilities, including through career fairs for Paralympic and Olympic athletes, with tangible results, leading to the hiring of 27 Paralympians and Olympians. For further information, see also our People Fact Book 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/who-we-are/documents/Allianz-People-Fact-Book-2023.pdf)**.\n\nAllianz is committed to strengthening its inclusive workplace culture for its entire global workforce, including employees with disabilities. For more details regarding our local ambitions, please see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### <span id=\"page-94-0\"></span>**Strategic Workforce Planning**\n\nAllianz has implemented Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) to create transparency on upcoming workforce developments. SWP compares workforce supply by cluster of job profiles (called Talent Segments) against projected workforce demand over the next five years. At Allianz, this is a structured yearly process that is integrated into the annual planning cycle. The result goes far beyond providing transparency on possible recruiting gaps. We are able to steer the mix of roles that we need in our workforce in order to implement Allianz strategies and fulfil our future vision. SWP provides a quantitative assessment of the resources required for ongoing transformations and indicates how our workforce can be equipped with the skills they need to remain employable in the future.\n\nThis global transparency allows us to decide what to focus our work on and customize solutions for up- and reskilling as well as retention and recruiting. SWP currently covers approximately 85% of our 2023 employee population. Global monitoring and steering using SWP KPIs ensures the implementation of Strategic Workforce Planning and maximizes its value within the business functions.\n\nGood working conditions along with equal treatment and equal opportunities for all are the basis for the CSRD convergence approach discussed in this Employee matters section. These subjects are an integral part of our brand value and societal commitments, as reflected in our ratings.\n\nOur positive social impact is verified and acknowledged by external certifications and global rankings (for further information, please refer to Great Place to Work certification in the section \"Processes to engage with own workforce\", EDGE certification in the section \"Fair remuneration\", and Refinitiv in the section \"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\"). Beyond certifications and rankings, Allianz is a member of the Valuable 500 and a trusted partner of the International Paralympics Committee (for further information, please \n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nMaterial (potential) impacts, risks, and opportunities for Allianz are outlined below in more detail:[1](#page-108-0)\n\n- − The topic \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) is assessed to be material from an own operations and value chain perspective.\n\t- − Adverse impacts in our own operations result from energy usage of our operations and our carbon footprint (mainly driven by this energy usage as well as by business travel), while positive measures are in place via in-place practices of energy savings and renewables usage.\n\t- − For Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to climate change can materialize through insuring and financing carbonintensive activities or sectors, or government exposures with high CO2 emissions (per capita). This is a current reflection, while (potential) adverse impacts for the current portfolios are expected to decrease over time as we work to implement our net-zero transition plan. Regarding positive impacts in our (re)insurance activities and investments, we focus on offering insurance products in line with our Sustainable Solutions framework and on enlarging our Sustainable Investments. For further information, please refer to the section \"02.1.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\t- − Related opportunities are considered material for our Property-Casualty lines and proprietary investments in that we are supporting our clients in their low-carbon transition journey in accordance with our Allianz sustainability strategy and targets.\n\t- − The materiality of climate change risks, especially in our value chain, is mainly driven through physical climate-related risks, with climate-related transition risks – such as policy and litigation risks – increasing with longer time horizons.\n\t- − For further information, please refer to the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n- − The environmental topics beyond the topic of \"Climate change\" which are nature-related – namely \"Pollution\" (ESRS E2), \"Water and marine resources\" (ESRS E3), \"Biodiversity and ecosystems\"\n\n(ESRS E4), and \"Resource use and circular economy\" (ESRS E5) – are assessed to be material for Allianz, primarily from a general value chain perspective.\n\n- − For Property-Casualty commercial lines and investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to these topics can materialize through insuring and financing pollution-, water use-/resource use-intensive and biodiversity-affecting activities, sectors, and governments. For our Property-Casualty retail insurance portfolio, particularly \"Resource use and circular economy\" is material, also giving rise to opportunities associated with our sustainable claims initiative (repair instead of replace).\n- − Given our provision of insurance coverage, the increase of physical hazards – also induced through biodiversity loss – poses a risk for Property-Casualty, which also puts pressure on insurability. This also applies for proprietary investments, given potential nature-related risks for our portfolio. In addition, there is also a potential short-term technology and resource scarcity/price risk for Property-Casualty retail insurance related to \"Resource use and circular economy\".\n- − The materiality of nature-related risks for our own operations and supply chain is related to potential supply chain interruptions and implications for our resource inflows/use, overall dependency on water, as well as potential policy changes in water-stressed areas and regarding resource outflow, especially (IT) waste, also with view to stakeholder expectations.\n- − The topic \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1) is assessed to be material for Allianz, as our employees are a key success factor for our business, and as we are committed to creating a Great Place To Work®.\n\t- − Positive impacts are created through Allianz practices on employee engagement, training, learning, and personal development, accompanied by strategic workforce planning. We have a strong focus on diversity, equal treatment, and inclusion as well as on talent acquisition and retention. The health and well-being of our employees continues to be an area of focus – our practices include offering flexibility in\n\n<span id=\"page-108-0\"></span>working time, paying above industry-average wages, and fostering freedom of association and dialogue with our employees. Furthermore, securing the confidentiality of employee data is key for us. By implementing these and further practices – including annual risk assessments regarding the protection of human/employee rights in accordance with the German Supply Chain Act – we continue to work to ensure (potential) adverse impacts are prevented and reduced.\n\n- − In terms of financial materiality, risk drivers relate to policy changes as well as skill shortage and retention risk, either associated with demographic change, or by not meeting employee expectations, especially compared to other employers.\n- − We also see opportunities associated with our employees, in that the practices mentioned above allow us to attract and retain talent as a key success factor for our business.\n- − The social topics alongside the value chain (ESRS S2-S4) are assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact and financial perspective.\n\t- − Potential adverse impacts related to \"Workers in the value chain\" (ESRS S2) and \"Affected communities\" (ESRS S3) may materialize for our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, given the large underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios, in which potential cases of insuring and financing activities that adversely affect workers or communities' economic, social, civil, political, and cultural rights may arise. In addition, the topic \"Workers in the value chain\" (ESRS S2) is assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact perspective regarding our suppliers (incl. service providers relevant for our Property-Casualty retail business). In accordance with the German Supply Chain Act, Allianz actively engages with suppliers that are exposed to potential human rights (or certain environmental) risks and expects that all suppliers respect human rights and environmental regulations in their own operations and alongside their supply chain.\n\t- − As to risks, potential cases of adverse impacts regarding value chain workers or affected communities in the value chain can also lead to spill-over effects for Allianz.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_As regards proprietary investments, this disclosure was developed using, among other sources, information from MSCI ESG Research LLC; for disclaimer visit **https://www.msci.com/notice-anddisclaimer**.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Regarding \"Consumers and end-users\" (ESRS S4), we identify actual positive impacts through our Life/Health and Property-Casualty retail, as well as our asset management business, by providing coverage in relation to personal life and health, strengthening protection against poverty, and fostering access to services for clients to reach their financial goals. In addition, securing data privacy and confidentiality of consumer data is key for us. Financial implications may particularly arise in case of policy changes.\n- − The topic \"Business conduct\" (ESRS G1) is assessed to be material for Allianz primarily from an own operations perspective.\n\t- − Given our practices related to corporate culture health, whistleblower protection, supplier management, and prevention of corruption and bribery, we deem our impacts on business conduct to be positive. In addition, we engage with political stakeholders with regards to sustainability-related aspects, and we actively engage in and support regulatory developments. Potential adverse impacts may arise from our proprietary investment portfolio, given exposures to sectors or governments with higher likelihood of business conductrelated issues.\n\t- − As business conduct is also reliant on the proper behavior of individuals, potential risks can never be fully eliminated. As a result, the matters of ethics and responsible business are also considered material from a financial perspective in our own operations and value chain. In addition, cybersecurity is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz in our own operations.\n\t- − Opportunities are associated with enhancing our corporate culture, with the aim of increasing risk awareness of our employees and avoiding misbehavior. In addition, engaging on sustainability-related matters with political stakeholders – such as the net-zero transition or via our contributions to (EU) standard-setting activities – is an opportunity for us to credibly convey our sustainability ambition and strategy.\n\nFor further information on how we addressthese material matters (e.g. prevention, mitigation) and contribute to sustainability, please refer to the previous sections of the Non-Financial Statement as well as the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Economic environment 2023[1](#page-110-1)\n\nIn economic terms, 2023 provided a few surprises: primarily, the resilience of the U.S. economy. The failure of the predicted recession to materialize was mainly due to U.S. consumers, who remained keen to consume thanks to a robust labor market and excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. As many companies had also secured the previous low interest rates for the long term, the turnaround in interest rates was not yet fully reflected in corporate balance sheets. The bottom line was relatively strong growth of 2.5%; at the same time, inflation fell sharply to 4.1% (annual average).\n\nThe expected upturn in China following the reopening of the economy after the long COVID-19 lockdowns turned out to be shortlived. Structural weaknesses – particularly the challenging situation in the real-estate market – quickly regained the upper hand and dampened sentiment. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy grew by 5.2% in 2023, although this was a rather modest development compared to previous years. Finally, the eurozone recorded weak growth of only 0.5%; at the same time, inflation remained at an annual average of over 5%, although it fell below 3% again at the end of the year. This weak growth was mainly due to developments in Germany, where the economic output fell by 0.3% as a result of the energy price shock. Global economic growth slowed to 2.7%, remaining only slightly below the pre-pandemic average. The fears of recession stoked at the beginning of 2023 did not materialize.\n\nThe interest rate turnaround remained the dominant topic in the financial markets, with the focus increasingly shifting to the question of the end-of-interest-rate-hike cycle. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank conducted their last interest rate hikes for the time being in July and September, respectively. In 2023, the key interest rates in the United States rose by 100 basis points to 5.5%, and in the eurozone by 200 basis points to 4.0% (deposit rate). Despite this fundamentally restrictive monetary policy, the end-of-interest-ratehikes and the expectation of future interest rate cuts led to strong price gains and optimism in the stock markets. U.S. equities (S&P 500) rose by 24% and even German equities (DAX) increased by 20% – despite the shrinking economy. A similar trend was also observed in government bond yields. Contrary to the further rise in key interest rates, yields on German government bonds fell by 53 basis points to 2.0%; U.S. government bonds remained virtually unchanged at 3.9%.\n\n# Business environment 2023 for the insurance industry\n\nInflation remained the defining issue for the insurance industry in 2023. Even though consumer price inflation slowed, claims inflation remained high, not least due to rising wages. This development had a negative impact on underwriting results in property and casualty insurance. Higher repair costs were also a factor – in addition to the climate change-related increase in damage events – that pushed insured losses from natural disasters above the USD 100 bn mark for the fourth year in a row.\n\nThe interest rate level was generally higher, which resulted in rising investment income for insurers from new investments and reinvestments. At the same time, however, this also intensified competition in the life business: simple investment products such as term deposits were once again able to score points with savers, which had a particularly negative impact on the single premium business. However, the feared wave of life policy lapses did not materialize, insurers' business remained stable.\n\nIn 2023, two familiar topics also became increasingly urgent: digitalization and sustainability. The breakthrough of generative artificial intelligence took the digitalization of business processes – especially the customer interface – to a new level. In terms of sustainability, insurability became a particular focus. Increasing natural hazards mean that some risk areas are no longer insurable at affordable prices. Some insurers in the United States have already responded by discontinuing new business in certain lines of business.\n\nIn the property-casualty sector, we observed strong premium growth in some areas in the reporting year, although this was primarily due to rising prices: all insurers had to increase premiums in response <span id=\"page-110-1\"></span>to the persistent claims inflation. Nevertheless, underwriting results remained under pressure in some divisions, like motor. Investment income also increased further due to higher yields.\n\nIn the life sector, premium development was much more subdued. There were also very large differences between the markets due to diverging market and product structures. In general, however, demand for risk products remained strong. Following the end of the pandemic, the topic of old-age provision is once again attracting more attention from consumers. As in property and casualty insurance, the sector has benefited from higher investment returns.\n\n# Business environment 2023 for the asset management industry\n\nThe asset management industry has faced considerable volatility in the capital market over the past 12 months. The key drivers for this were surging inflation and rapidly changing interest rates, compounded by banking turmoil and geopolitical upheaval. Another relevant change is the structural shift towards CO2-neutral business models, bringing with it a requirement for new investment solutions.\n\nStock markets rose, with the MSCI World Index up by 23.8% in 2023. For bonds, active management demonstrated its value for achieving returns against the backdrop of rapidly changing interest rates. Although active investments still account for most of the assets under management, growth in passive and alternative investments continued in 2023. Besides the focus on CO2 emissions and the ongoing growth in ESG-oriented offerings (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance), digitalization with the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies is becoming increasingly important. AI, for example, is creating new opportunities when it comes to analyzing large and unstructured sets of data. Furthermore, AI is finding its way into supporting operational efficiency via innovative forms of automation. Client satisfaction remains a high priority for the asset management value chain as a whole.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_At the date of the publication of this report, not all general market data for the year 2023 used in this chapter was final.

This was mostly driven by our Property-Casualty business segment due to positive price effects and volume effects, from many entities including Allianz Partners, AGCS, and Germany. The Life/Health and the Asset Management business segments also recorded positive internal growth.\n\nOur operating profit increased by 6.7 % in comparison to 2022. This was mainly due to a higher operating investment result from our United States operations in the Life/Health business segment. Our Property-Casualty business segment recorded a solid operating profit driven by a higher operating investment result; this was partly offset by a lower operating fee and other result as well as the insurance service result. Operating profit from our Asset Management business segment declined slightly, mainly as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.\n\nOur operating investment result increased by € 1,025 mn to € 4.8 bn, largely driven by the United States due to an accounting mismatch in the prior year. In addition, in our Property-Casualty business segment we recorded higher interest and similar income mostly due to higher interest rates.\n\nOur non-operating result improved by € 1.0 bn to a loss of € 3.2 bn as the prior year result was negatively impacted by the increase in the Structured Alpha provision. In the current year, we recorded lower non-operating net investment income.\n\nIncome taxes decreased by € 259 mn to € 2.5 bn, and the effective tax rate decreased to 22.0 % (29.1 %), due to a more favorable profit mix, tax benefits from write-up of deferred tax assets on tax losses, higher tax-exempted income, and the absence of nonrecurring items.\n\nThe increase in net income was largely driven by an increase in the provision for litigation expenses for Structured Alpha booked in the first quarter of 2022, higher operating profit, and lower income taxes. Shareholders' core net income was strong at € 9.1 bn.\n\n<span id=\"page-111-2\"></span><span id=\"page-111-1\"></span>Our shareholders' equity[3](#page-111-1) increased by € 4,062 mn to € 58.5 bn, compared to 31 December 2022. This increase was mainly driven by the net income and positive net OCI, partly offset by the dividend payout and share-buy-back program. Over the same period, our Solvency II capitalization ratio increased to 206 %[4](#page-111-2) .\n\nFor a more detailed description of the results generated by each individual business segment (Property-Casualty insurance operations, Life/Health insurance operations, Asset Management, and Corporate and Other), please consult the respective chapters on the following pages.\n\n# Other information\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the responsibilities of the Board of Management.

This was mainly caused by price increases, predominantly from motor and property business.\n\nTürkiye: Total business volume amounted to € 1,419 mn – up 109.1% on an internal basis.

The € 843 mn rise in our non-operating result was largely due to the higher non-operating investment result, which increased by € 722 mn, mainly due to favorable valuation and lower impairments.

This was due to higher sales in the fixed index annuities business.\n\nItaly: Total business volume increased to € 11,229 mn, a 0.9% increase on an internal basis, mainly due to increases in capital efficient guarantee products and protection and health.\n\nFrance: Total business volume fell slightly to € 7,167 mn, a 1.0% decrease on an internal basis.\n\nAsia-Pacific: Total business volume decreased across the region, except for Thailand and Indonesia, to € 5,872 mn, a 5.7% decrease, on an internal basis. This was driven mainly by Taiwan (€ 380 mn) due to lower unit-linked without guarantees business as a result of contraction in the unit-linked market because of regulatory changes, and China (€ 254 mn), mainly from a decrease in savings and annuities.\n\n# Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)[3](#page-114-2)\n\nOur PVNBP increased by 1.6% to € 67,281 mn. The increase is predominantly driven by the United States due to higher sales in the fixed indexed annuity business and Allianz Reinsurance, through a large reinsurance treaty.

Other operating result represents the sum of Operating result from investment contracts, Operating fee and commission result, and Operating other result.\n\nOperating profit was strong at € 5,191 mn, up 23.1%, mainly due to Allianz Life hedge alignment and normalization. The main drivers of the increase in operating profit are described below:\n\nContractual Service Margin (CSM) release is the main source of profit. The slight decrease was mainly driven by our United States and Reinsurance business caused by a high release in 2022, and Mexico from reclassification of investment business to IFRS 9 following a contract modification. This was partially offset by France from higher release on repriced protection and health products, and Italy from profitable new business and better economics.\n\nRelease of risk adjustment decreased, mainly driven by an assumption update.\n\nVariance from claims and expenses improved, mainly from France and Asia-Pacific, with improved claims experience in protection and health.\n\nLosses and reversals of losses on onerous contracts improved primarily driven by prior year negative impacts with unprofitable unitlinked and protection business in France, losses in Russia following the war in Ukraine, as well as Taiwan savings, driven by favorable interest rates.\n\n#### Non-attributable expenses were stable.\n\nOperating investment result increased significantly from an extraordinary low result in the prior year. In the United States, we recorded negative hedge impacts on variable annuities in 2022 that turned positive as the hedging strategy of our United States business has been aligned from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17 accounting. This was partially offset by an adverse impact from discounting in protection and health in France in line with interest rates evolution.\n\nOther operating result increased slightly, mainly due to a reclassification of the investment business to IFRS 9 in Mexico following a contract modification and a one-off gain realized on headquarter sale in Luxembourg. This was partly offset mainly by a lower result of Investment Contracts as a result of reduced Assets under Management in Italy.\n\n# Contractual service margin (CSM) development\n\nThe CSM increased by 0.7%, compared to 31 December 2022, from € 52,227 mn to € 52,601 mn. The drivers of the € 375 mn increase were as follows:\n\nNew business contribution was strong at € 4,515 mn, mostly driven by the United States with € 1,320 mn, Germany Life with € 880 mn, Asia-Pacific with € 649 mn, Italy with € 496 mn, and France with € 416 mn.\n\nExpected in-force return of € 3,022 mn is in line with an implied risk-free rate of 4.4% plus an overreturn yield of 1.4 %.\n\nEconomic variances of € 500 mn were caused by favorable impact from market movements (€ 0.9 bn), driven by higher equity markets and lower interest rates, offsetting adverse impact from weaker real estate. In addition, there was a negative foreign currency translation impact of € 0.4 bn.\n\nNon-economic variances reduced CSM by € 2,696 mn, mainly driven by model and assumption changes and experience variances (€ 1.2 bn), reclassification of investment business in Mexico from IFRS 17 to IFRS 9 (impact was negative € 0.7 bn), and a one-off cost correction in Germany (impact was negative € 0.8 bn).

On the one hand, this reflects the expectation that inflation is largely under control, as annual average inflation will probably be within striking distance of inflation targets in both the United States (2.3 %) and the eurozone (2.5 %). On the other hand, it is a reaction to the continued weakness in demand, which is fed by several sources: the delayed effect of interest rate hikes on investment, declining fiscal policy support, and depleted savings reserves. Overall, we therefore expect economic growth to decline in 2024, falling by 0.3 percentage points to 2.4 % worldwide; for the United States, we expect it to decline to 1.4 % (-1.0 percentage points). Only the eurozone is likely to reach around the previous year's level with a rate of 0.8 %, as a return to positive growth is assumed for Germany. China will also face headwinds, not least due to its structural problems: we expect rather modest growth of 4.6 %.\n\nOngoing uncertainty about the timing and extent of the next interest rate moves means volatility in the financial markets will remain high in 2024. As the expected cuts in interest rates have already been anticipated in many market prices, disappointment and corresponding market reactions cannot be ruled out. Overall, equities and bonds are likely to move more or less sideways.\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is subject to a special caveat since it is a super election year. Citizens will go to the polls in countries that account for 60 % of global economic output – from India to the United States – with election results significantly impacting the economic and geopolitical constellation. First and foremost, this applies to the U.S. elections in November. The associated global political uncertainty is fostering a wait-and-see-attitude among companies and households. There is also the threat of rising political and social tensions as a result of increasing polarization in a weak economic environment.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nInflation will remain a dominant topic for the insurance industry in 2024, as claims inflation is unlikely to fall as quickly as consumer price inflation, mainly due to rising wages. However, continued premium increases mean that pressure on underwriting results should ease. On the other hand, the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment is hampering premium growth.\n\nIn view of the increasing geopolitical upheavals, climate-related natural hazards, and technological risks worldwide, the need for risk protection and prevention remains high. Thanks to its financial strength, the insurance industry can meet these needs with innovative solutions, so its role as a partner for strengthening social resilience will continue to grow in importance.\n\nDespite ongoing high volatility, the investment environment should remain relatively friendly in 2024. The higher interest rate level offers good opportunities for long-term investors, and insurers' investment income is likely to continue to rise.\n\nPremium growth in the property-casualty insurance sector will continue at a slower pace; however, as in the previous year it is likely to be driven primarily by rising prices. At the same time, claims development remains challenging, with structural factors such as increasing climate-related natural catastrophes also playing a role. Investment income is expected to increase. As higher wages are putting pressure on operating costs, increasing productivity through fully digitalized processes is essential.\n\nIn the life insurance sector, providers are increasingly reflecting the higher interest rate level in their products, which should benefit demand for savings and pension products. This is possible because awareness of the need for protection in old age not only remains high but should also continue to rise in the future. The same applies to demand in the risk business. Furthermore, higher investment income will strengthen profitability.\n\n## <span id=\"page-120-0\"></span>Asset management industry outlook\n\nIn 2024, the asset management industry will probably face a different economic landscape to 2023, and will also be impacted by megatrends, including disruptive technologies and sustainability.\n\nThis challenging environment is an opportunity for active asset management to demonstrate its value potential by focusing on diversification and risk management, which help to deliver outperformance.\n\nWith inflation falling and rate cuts expected in the United States and the eurozone, there will be many opportunities in bond markets. Fixed income will therefore be an important asset class for investors in 2024. Investment grade, for example, is likely to benefit from strong yield levels, manageable supply and still decent fundamentals. Demand for alternatives – especially private market assets – is also expected to remain high. This trend is supported by investors looking for both diversification and protection against inflation. Infrastructure – including renewable energy – is expected to grow further, driven by the effort to limit CO2 emissions. In this context, ESG-oriented investments are becoming more complex and competitive, as many investors seek ways to make a real-world impact by focusing on environmental and inclusive-growth themes.\n\nTechnology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), will emerge as a core part of the long-term opportunity set. AI will be increasingly implemented and will help raise global productivity by both automating laborious tasks and analyzing large data sets .\n\nMargin pressure is very likely to persist, driven by passive products as well as fierce competition. Despite this multifaceted situation, the asset management industry meets all the prerequisites to remain attractive and return to a long-term growth path.\n\n1\\_The information presented in the sections \"Economic outlook\", \"Insurance industry outlook\", and \"Asset management industry outlook\" is based on our own estimates.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Overview: outlook and assumptions for the Allianz Group in 2024\n\n| Outlook 2024      |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allianz Group     | Operating profit of € 14.8 bn, plus or minus € 1 bn.                                                                                                                                             |\n|                   | Protect shareholder value while continuing to provide<br>attractive returns and dividends.                                                                                                       |\n|                   | Selective profitable growth.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Property-Casualty | Total business volume growth of 5 % to 7 %.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                   | Operating profit of € 7.3 bn, plus or minus 10 %.                                                                                                                                                |\n|                   | Combined ratio to be in a range of approximately 93 % to<br>94 %.                                                                                                                                |\n|                   | Operating investment income (net) further benefiting from<br>high interest-rate environment while unwinding of<br>discounted loss reserves weighing negatively.                                  |\n| Life/Health       | Continue to focus on profitable growth; keep developing<br>capital-efficient products; expand to new markets.

For 2024, we envisage 3% growth overall, resulting from growth in Property-Casualty and Asset Management, combined with relatively stable revenues in Life/Health, owing to our selective focus on profitable growth.\n\nOur operating profit was € 14.7 bn in 2023. For 2024, we envisage strong performance in all business segments and an overall operating profit of € 14.8 bn, plus or minus € 1.0 bn.\n\nOur core net income attributable to shareholders was € 9.1 bn in 2023. Consistent with our disclosure practice in the past and given the sensitivity of our non-operating results to capital market developments, we have chosen not to provide a precise outlook for net income. However, since our outlook presumes no major disruptions in our capital markets, we anticipate a positive development for both net income and core net income in 2024.\n\nIn this business segment, we expect total business volume to increase by 5% to 7% in 2024 (total business volume growth in 2023: 8.4%) due to organic growth, which is supported by favorable price and volume effects across our subsidiaries.\n\nWe believe that the rise in prices we saw in a number of markets in 2023 will continue in 2024. That said, we will continue to focus on achieving strong insurance service results by adhering to our strict underwriting discipline, as in previous years.\n\nOur combined ratio was 93.8% in 2023, which is above target. In 2024, we envisage a combined ratio in the range of approximately 93% to 94%. The underlying assumption is that the aggregate effect of improvements in pricing, claims management, and productivity will compensate for inflation in attritional claims. The impact of discounting loss reserves on our combined ratio depends on the <span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>development of interest rate levels throughout 2024. As for impacts from natural catastrophes, despite the highly volatile nature of such catastrophes in recent years, we expect those claims to be at approximately 3%.\n\nThe investment income is expected to further benefit from the high interest-rate environment, despite a likely reduction of interest rates in the second half of 2024. Going forward, we will continue to actively adapt our investment strategy to changing market conditions. It should be noted that, with the introduction of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard, the unwinding of discounted loss reserves will weigh on our investment income, dependent on interest rate levels of prior years.\n\nOverall, we expect our 2024 operating profit to be € 7.3 bn, plus or minus 10% (2023: € 6.9 bn).\n\nCore RoE is one of the KPIs used in the financial steering of Life/Health. In 2024, we expect this KPI to be between 14% and 17% (2023: 16.3%). We expect that CSM normalized growth will be between 4% and 5%, which will support long-term stability and growth of operating profit.\n\nAt € 5.2 bn, the operating profit of our Life/Health business segment was within the target range in 2023. For 2024, we expect an operating profit of around € 5.2 bn, plus or minus 10%.\n\nFor 2024, we envisage overall moderate third-party net inflows and market returns at both PIMCO and AllianzGI, after a year of capital market volatility and high inflation. Margins should remain relatively stable, and we expect a normal level of performance fees, resulting in modest operating revenue growth. We further assume an average U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.091. All things considered and reflecting our current asset base, we expect our 2024 operating profit to be € 3.1 bn, plus or minus 10% (2023: € 3.1 bn).\n\nOur cost-income ratio should be approximately 61% in 2024 (2023: 61.3%) as we continue to invest in business growth. Over the medium term, we expect to grow further; this also depends on the market development.\n\nIn this business segment, we recorded an operating loss of € 0.5 bn in 2023. For 2024, we envisage an operating loss of € 0.8 bn plus or minus 10%.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Non-financial KPIs\n\nAs outlined in the \"Our Steering\" section in our [Business Operations](#page-52-0) chapter, we have also set ourselves non-financial targets. For further information on the past and expected development of these nonfinancial KPIs, please refer to th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n# Financing, liquidity development, and capitalization\n\nThe Allianz Group enjoys a very robust liquidity position and excellent financial strength, as well as a healthy business mix and global diversification. This allows us to maintain high performance, despite challenges and market volatility faced by our insurance segment. The Allianz Group's Solvency II capitalization is well above regulatory requirements.\n\nAs a result, we have full access to financial markets and are in a position to raise financing at lower cost. We are determined to maintain our financial flexibility, which is supported by both the prudent steering of our liquidity resources, and our well-balanced debt maturity profile.\n\nWe are managing our portfolios with great diligence, in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to back its solvency capital and liquidity needs. In addition, we will continue to monitor the sensitivity of our Solvency II capitalization ratio with regard to changes in interest rates and spreads, by continuing to ensure prudent asset/liability management and life product design.\n\n# Expected dividend development<sup>1</sup>\n\nAllianz management is committed to shareholder participation in the economic development of the Allianz Group in the form of dividend payments and share buy-back programs. Through prudent capital management, the Allianz Group aims to maintain a healthy balance between achieving attractive yields and investing in profitable growth, while assuring an adequate capitalization. Due to our strong business development and an attractive dividend policy, the dividend has increased by an average of 10% over the past 10 years (2013- 2022). In the interest of an attractive dividend to our shareholders, we will increase the regular payout ratio from 50% to 60% of the Group´s net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted for extraordinary and volatile items. For 2023, the Allianz SE Board of Management and the Supervisory Board propose a dividend of € 13.80 per share.\n\nIn addition, as part of our policy to return capital to shareholders on a flexible basis, Allianz SE executed nine share buy-back programs with an aggregate volume of € 12.5 bn in the period from 2017 to 2023. An additional € 1.0 bn will be executed in 2024.\n\nAll of the above is subject to our sustainable Solvency II capitalization ratio being above 150% – which is considerably below our year-end 2023 level of 206%[2](#page-122-0) .\n\n# Management's overall assessment of the Allianz Group's current economic situation\n\nAt the date of issuance of this Annual Report and based on current information regarding natural catastrophes and capital market trends – in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities – the Board of Management has no indication of the Allianz Group facing any major adverse developments.\n\n# Cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements, such as prospects or expectations, that are based on management's current views and assumptions and subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance figures, or events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\n\nDeviations may arise due to changes in factors including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the general economic and competitive situation in Allianz's core business and core markets, (ii) the performance of financial markets (in particular market volatility, liquidity, and credit events), (iii) adverse publicity, regulatory actions or litigation with respect to the Allianz Group, other well-known companies, and the financial services industry generally, (iv) the <span id=\"page-122-0\"></span>frequency and severity of insured loss events, including those resulting from natural catastrophes, and the development of loss expenses, (v) mortality and morbidity levels and trends, (vi) persistency levels, (vii) the extent of credit defaults, (viii) interest rate levels, (ix) currency exchange rates, most notably the EUR/USD exchange rate, (x) changes in laws and regulations, including tax regulations, (xi) the impact of acquisitions, including and related to integration issues and reorganization measures, and (xii) the general competitive conditions that, in each individual case, apply at a local, regional, national, and/or global level. Many of these changes can be exacerbated by terrorist activities.\n\n# No duty to update\n\nAllianz assumes no obligation to update any information or forwardlooking statement contained herein, save for any information we are required to disclose by law.\n\nthe Management and Supervisory Boards, each of which may elect to deviate, if and as appropriate, under the then prevailing circumstances, as well as to the approval of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This represents management's current state of planning and may be revised in the future.

The retained earnings were mainly decreased by the share buy-back program with an amount of € 2.2 bn and the dividend payout in May 2023 (€ 4.5 bn). This was compensated by the net income attributable to shareholders of € 8.5 bn for the year ended 31 December 2023. The increase in other unrealized gains and losses (net) of € 23.3 bn was almost offset by the decrease of unrealized gains and loss from insurance contracts (net) with an amount of € 20.6 bn. The development of unrealized gains and losses is driven by the increase of interest rate level over the course of the year 2023.\n\n# Total assets and total liabilities\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, total assets amounted to € 983.2 bn and total liabilities were € 919.6 bn.

About 94 % of the debt portfolio was invested in investment-grade bonds and loans.[1](#page-124-0) Our government bonds portfolio contained bonds from France, Germany, Italy, and the United States, representing 13.0%, 12.4 %, 9.7% and 8.8 % of our portfolio shares. Our corporate bonds portfolio contained bonds from the United States, the eurozone, and Europe excl. the eurozone. They represented 41.7 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % of our portfolio shares.\n\nOur exposure to equities decreased, mainly due to decreasing volume.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Allianz Group may enter into arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Since the Allianz Group does not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements as a significant source of revenue or financing, our off-balance sheet exposure to loss is immaterial relative to our financial position.\n\nThe Allianz Group enters into various commitments including loan commitments, purchase obligations, and other commitments. For more details, please refer to [note 8.13](#page-237-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Allianz Group has also entered into contractual relationships with various types of structured entities. They have been designed in such a way that their relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements rather than voting or similar rights. Typically, structured entities have been set up in connection with asset-backed financing and certain investment fund products. For more details on our involvement with structured entities, please refer t[o note 8.11](#page-235-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nPlease refer to the [Risk and Opportunity Report](#page-129-0) for a description of the main concentrations of risk and other relevant risk positions.\n\n<span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>For details on the regulatory capitalization of the Allianz Group, please refer to ou[r Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-125-0\"></span>LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RESOURCES\n\n# Organization\n\nThe Allianz Group's liquidity management is based on policies and guidelines approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management. Allianz SE and each of the operating entities are responsible for managing their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz SE provides central cash pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is managed by Allianz SE for the entire Group. This structure allows the efficient use of liquidity and capital resources, and enables Allianz SE to achieve the desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its operating entities.\n\n# Liquidity management of our operating entities\n\nThe major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are primary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the maturity or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay claims arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and related expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations, acquisition costs, and operating costs.\n\nWe receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the interim to create investment income.\n\nOur insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims. Generally, our investments in fixed-income securities are sequenced to mature when funds are expected to be needed.\n\nThe overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on capital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to realize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance claims and policyholder benefits. Other factors affecting the liquidity of our Property-Casualty insurance operations include the timing, frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy\n\nrenewal rates. In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the assumptions underlying our life insurance reserves. Market returns, crediting rates, and the behavior of our life insurance clients – for example, regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals – can also have a significant impact.\n\nWithin our Asset Management operations, the most important sources of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities. These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.\n\n# Liquidity management and funding of Allianz SE\n\nThe main responsibility for managing the funding needs of the Allianz Group, maximizing access to liquidity sources and optimizing the trade off between borrowing costs, balancing the maturity profile, and the choice between senior and subordinated funding instruments, lies with Allianz SE. As such, the following sections include comments on the liquidity and funding resources of Allianz SE. Restrictions on the transferability of capital within the Group mainly result from the capital maintenance rules under applicable corporate laws as well as from the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulated Group companies.\n\nAllianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our operating entities. The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are dividends received from its subsidiaries and external funding raised in the capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily available assets – specifically cash, money market securities, and highly liquid fixed-income securities. Our funds are primarily used for interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends or share buy-backs to our shareholders.\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE in the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are described below. In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered by issuing senior bonds, subordinated bonds or ordinary no-par value shares.\n\n### **Share capital**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the issued share capital as registered at the Commercial Register was € 1,169,920,000. This was divided into 391,718,983 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group held 260,394 (2022: 1,724,834) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital according to authorizations provided by the Annual General Meeting. The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2023:\n\n### **Capital authorizations ofAllianz SE**\n\n| Capital authorization          | Nominal amount | Expiry date of<br>the authorization |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital<br>2022/I1  | € 467,968,000  | 3 May 2027                          |\n| Authorized Capital<br>2022/II2 | € 15,000,000   | 3 May 2027                          |\n| Conditional Capital<br>20223   | € 116,992,000  | 3 May 2027                          |\n\n1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind.\n\n2\\_For issuance of shares to employees (without shareholders' subscription rights).\n\n3\\_To cover conversion or option rights of holders of bonds.\n\nFor further information on our share capital and regarding authorizations to issue and repurchase shares, please refer to the chapter [Takeover-Related Statements and Explanations](#page-23-0) (part of the Group Management Report).\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Long-term debt funding**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE had senior and subordinated bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus on long-term financing.

This was mainly driven by higher net changes from our insurance and investment contract liabilities with partially offsetting effects from financial assets for unit-linked contracts. In addition, last year we recorded the settlement of the majority of the provision related to the Structured Alpha matter.\n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased by € 3.0 bn to € 12.0 bn in 2023. This was mainly due to net cash inflows from derivative assets and liabilities after material net cash outflows in 2022, in particular in our Life/Health business operations. Lower net cash inflows from investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly in our Life/Health business operations in Germany, France, and the United States, as well as higher net cash outflows from investments measured at fair value through profit or loss, partly compensated this effect.\n\nNet cash outflow used in financing activities increased by € 1.4 bn and amounted to € 5.7 bn in 2023. This development was largely driven by lower net cash inflows from liabilities to banks and customers and other financial liabilities as well as higher net cash outflows from the Allianz SE share buy-back program. Lower net cash outflows from our refinancing activities and higher net cash inflows from transactions between equityholders partially offset these effects.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by € 6.3 bn, mainly stemming from our Life/Health business operations in Germany and the United States.\n\nFor further information on the above, please refer to our [Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.](#page-155-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group maintained its A-1+/Prime-1 ratings for short-term issuances. We can therefore continue funding our liquidity under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at an average rate below Euribor, and under the U.S. Dollar Commercial Paper Program at an average rate slightly above SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate).\n\nFurther potential sources of short-term funding that allow the Allianz Group to fine-tune its capital structure include letter of credit facilities and bank credit lines.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>RECONCILIATIONS\n\nThe analysis in the previous chapters is based on our consolidated Internal growth financial statements and should be read in conjunction with them. In addition to our figures stated in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Allianz Group uses total business volume, operating profit, shareholders' core net income, and internal growth to enhance the understanding of our results. These additional measures should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, our figures determined according to IFRS.\n\nFor further information, please refer t[o note](#page-172-0) 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Total business volume\n\nTotal business volume comprises gross premiums written as well as fee and commission income in Property-Casualty, statutory gross premiums in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management.\n\n#### **Composition of total business volume**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Property-Casualty                   |         |         |\n| Total business volume               | 76,531  | 70,613  |\n| consisting of:                      |         |         |\n| Gross premiums written              | 73,998  | 68,222  |\n| Fee and commission income           | 2,534   | 2,391   |\n| Life/Health                         |         |         |\n| Statutory gross premiums            | 77,878  | 75,258  |\n| Asset Management                    |         |         |\n| Operating revenues                  | 8,086   | 8,234   |\n| consisting of:                      |         |         |\n| Net fee and commission income       | 7,960   | 8,211   |\n| Net investment result               | 95      | 7       |\n| Other income and expenses           | 31      | 16      |\n| Consolidation                       | (795)   | (781)   |\n| Allianz Group total business volume | 161.700 | 153.324 |\n\nWe believe that an understanding of our total business volume performance is enhanced when the effects of foreign currency translation as well as acquisitions, disposals, and transfers (or \"changes in scope of consolidation\") are analyzed separately.

While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies' capital requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of the Group, Allianz SE and its other related undertakings, and apply regular stress tests (including standardized, historical, and reverse stress test scenarios as well as monthly stress and scenario analyses focusing on current and possible future developments). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency strength. For example, the risk capital reflecting the risk profile and the cost of capital is an important aspect that is considered in business decisions. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite and in line with the risk strategy. The implemented sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continuous alignment of the risk and business strategy, and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition,our liquidity risk management framework ensures that all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market and business conditions (expected as well as stressed).\n\n# Risk governance system and internal control system\n\nAs a provider of financial services, we consider risk management, including an internal control system (ICS), to be a core competency and an integralpart of our business. Our risk management framework covers all operations and subsidiaries within the Group in proportion to the inherent risks of their activities, ensuring that risks across the Group are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management and internal control system framework are:\n\n- − Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- − Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk capital framework to protect our capital base and support effective capital management.\n- − Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allocating capital to business segments, products, and strategies.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- − Risk identification, assessment and underwriting: A robust system of risk identification, assessment and underwriting forms the foundation for appropriate risk management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation methods, individual transaction and new product approvals, emerging/operational/top risk assessments, liquidity risk and scenario analyses, amongst others.\n- − Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite in line with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards are appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies work in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n- − Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework provides management with the transparency needed to assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n- − Communication and transparency: Transparent risk disclosure provides the basis for communicating our strategy and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens the risk awareness and risk culture.\n\nIn order to support these pillars, especially risk identification, assessment and monitoring, the Allianz Group has established an ICS, which consists of both specific risk controls and further control elements. Its objectives are to:\n\n- − Safeguard the Group's existence and business continuity.\n- − Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n- − Create a strong internal control environment, ensuring that all personnel are aware of the importance of internal controls and their role within the internal control system.\n- − Provide the management bodies with the relevant information for their decision-making processes.\n\nNotwithstanding the oversight exercised by the Supervisory Board of the Allianz SE, controls are performed within the Allianz Group in terms of control areas, activities, and reporting, taking into account independence requirements, where applicable. The controls are embedded into the operational and organizational set-up throughout the Allianz Group and are subject to periodic reviews. Where appropriate, internationally recognized control frameworks such as the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) or the IT-related Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are used.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nInternal controls, therefore, describe the set of activities undertaken by and within the Allianz Group to achieve defined control objectives, applied across all business segments and lines of business. These controls help to continuously review the effectiveness of the relevant processes and procedures (including operations and reporting), their coherence and proportionality within the Group, and to identify potential actions for the timely rectification of deficiencies. The ICS of the Allianz Group encompasses the entirety of activities undertaken to perform controls in different areas.\n\nThe ICS comprises various control concepts. Besides general elements related to all control activities, and in addition to the Risk Management Framework, specific controls are utilized, in particular, but not exclusively, around entity level controls, financial reporting, IT, risk capital calculation, underwriting (including products and distribution), investments, data privacy, customer protection, and protection/resilience. These are supplemented by management reports.\n\n### **Integrated Risk and Control System for financial and non-financial reporting**\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to §289(4) and §315(4) of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB\"). For general information about our Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) and the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), please refer to the section \"Operational risk\".\n\n#### **Accounting and consolidation processes**\n\nThe accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a central consolidation and reporting IT solution and local general ledger solutions. The latter are largely harmonized throughout the Group, using standardized processes, master data, posting logics, and interfaces for data delivery to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are managed according to strict authorization and hierarchylinked procedures.\n\nAccounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure of all items in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes related to the annual and interim financial statements are defined primarily in our Group accounting manual.\n\n#### **Control system for financial and non-financial reporting**\n\nSpecific internal controls for financial reporting, which follow the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) approach and the general Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), are embedded in the accounting and consolidation processes to safeguard the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information provided in our financial statements.\n\nThe dedicated financial reporting control system approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- − A centrally developed risk catalog is linked to individual accounts. This risk catalog is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as the operating entities' scope of financial reporting risks. In the course of the scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria, such as the expected increase in business volume or the complexity of transactions.\n- − Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, our local entities identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- − Preventive and detective key controls addressing financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial misstatements. When a potential risk is detected or materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on information technology systems, we have also implemented IT controls.\n- − Operating entity level controls to address non-financial reporting risks have been introduced and will be expanded going forward.\n- − Group Audit and local internal audit functions ensure that these controls are subject to regular control testing, in order to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness. Internal Audit does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach that assesses the key controls of the company's internal procedures and processes, including local and group-internal controls over financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.\n\n#### **Governance**\n\nGroup Accounting & Reporting and other Group center functions, the Group Disclosure Committee, and our operating entities support the Allianz SE Board of Management to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Group Accounting & Reporting also helps to ensure that non-financial reporting requirements are fulfilled and that data quality requirements are adhered to.\n\nThe Group Disclosure Committee ensures that the Board members are made aware of all material information that could affect our disclosures and assesses the completeness and accuracy of the information provided in the quarterly statements, half-year and annual financial reports (including the Non-Financial Statement) as well as in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report and the Regular Supervisory Report. In 2023, the Group Disclosure Committee met on a quarterly basis before the quarterly statements and financial reports were issued. In addition, the Group Disclosure Committee reviewed and approved the Solvency II reports prior to issuance.\n\nSubsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individually responsible for adhering to the Group's internal governance and control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are similar to the Group-level committee. The entities' CEOs and CFOs provide periodic signoffs to the management of Allianz SE, certifying the effectiveness of their local systems of internal control as well as the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data and nonfinancial information reported to the Holding.\n\n### **Compliance management system**\n\nThe risk management system encompasses both a set of principles for specifically addressing the operational and reputational risks stemming from non-compliance with laws, regulations, and other external requirements that represent a significant compliance risk (hereafter referred to as \"compliance risks\"), as well as their reflection in internal corporate rules.\n\nFor the management of compliance risks, Allianz maintains a Compliance Management System (CMS). At the center of the CMS, Allianz has established compliance functions at the levels of the Allianz Group and the local operating entities as part of the Second Line of Defense. For details of the CMS, or more specifically of anticorruption and bribery matters, please refer to the [Non-Financial](#page-55-0)  [Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Management assessment[1](#page-131-0)**\n\nThe management feels comfortable with the Group's overall risk profile. It has no indication that, as of 31 December 2023, our risk management system or internal control system is inappropriate or ineffective, and is therefore confident that they meet both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and day-to-day business needs.\n\nThis assessment is based on several factors:\n\n- − We run an established system to monitor the effectiveness of the internal control system and to report and promptly address deficiencies, such as control failures, operational loss events, financial limit breaches, or system of governance issues. On a quarterly basis, the Group's Internal Control System Report is jointly prepared by the Group's key control functions, and shared with the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and the members of the Board of Management of the Allianz SE. The report aggregates and rates the severity of known weaknesses in the internal control system, while also tracking their timely and satisfactory resolution.\n- − Our Group risk management framework, including the Group's internal control system, are regularly the subject of audit activities performed by our Group's Internal Audit function.\n- − In addition, external auditors are independently and regularly reviewing Allianz Group's risk governance as well as performing quality reviews of risk processes, including the ICS.\n- − An assessment of the effectiveness of the Allianz operating entities' Risk Management functions, as well as of the implementation maturity of the risk management framework and corresponding risk management processes, is performed following the Risk Assessment, Diagnostics, Analysis and Reporting (RADAR) process.\n- − Allianz has dedicated guidelines and policies that clearly define the general principles, the roles and responsibilities, as well as the processes, for both the risk management framework and the internal control system.\n\nAllianz will be required to comply with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) regulations by the end of the financial year 2024. While the new CSRD reporting requirements are being established, our internal control system is undergoing continual enhancements. A dedicated project helps to ensure diligent preparation for CSRD implementation, including the early identification of where improvements are necessary.\n\n### **Structured Alpha funds of AllianzGI U.S.**\n\nAs highlighted in our prior year report, the settlement of Structured Alpha related litigations was finalized both with investors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the uncertainties linked to this litigation have now been completely curtailed, the Allianz Group continues to exercise diligence in assuring that the Asset Management segment's internal control systems, as well as those of the Group, benefit from the key learnings stemming from this event. We continue to enhance risk management, compliance, and other assurance measures. This covers not only our response to Structured Alpha derived root causes, but we have ensured that periodic reviews of our internal controls systems' frameworks and underlying procedures also remain sensitive to a constant and rapidly evolving risk landscape.\n\nGoing beyond Management's evaluation of control measures and tactics, various audits undertaken by both internal and external auditors have been completed to confirm the robustness and persistence of the internal control system. The Asset Management segment in particular has also undergone various regulatory reviews and audits throughout various regions, and no significant issues or topics have been raised by the regulators.\n\nAs part of our settlement procedures, Allianz has also completed control environment assessment steps related to our U.S. investment advisory services. These assessments were finalized and conclusions reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in 2023. As this was one of the final key milestones, the Allianz Group has fulfilled its legal obligations to the U.S. authorities.\n\nIn addition to efforts triggered by the AllianzGI Structured Alpha matter, a strengthening of trainings for safeguarding functions and Allianz Global Executives further improved the Allianz Group's risk management framework in the last year.\n\n### **Our business aspirations**\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives for the Allianz Group's medium-term strategy, building on the success of the efforts to simplify the company, with the motto \"Simplicity at Scale\":\n\n- <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>− Growth: We consistently seek to capture growth opportunities for our business, and to create growth opportunities for our employees. This is how we ensure our leading market position. Due to our full breadth of products and services, we offer comprehensive solutions that meet our customers' needs and make us a trusted partner.\n- − Margin Expansion: We need to be profitable and efficient. To do so we are continuously improving our productivity, including in our distribution channels, while seeking to grow in high margin business segments. Additionally, we will continue our transformation so that our processes are simpler, digital, and scalable.\n- − Capital Efficiency: We consistently seek ways to use our capital in the most effective way and take action when, among others, it falls below our RoE threshold.\n\nThese objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the 2022 to 2024 period. With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds<sup>2</sup>) of more than 13 %, while aiming to grow our earnings per share from € 21 (baseline full year 2021, as communicated in the Allianz Capital Markets Day 2021) to approximately € 25[3](#page-131-0) by 2024 (reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 5 % to 7 %).\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set ourselves non-financial targets that reflect strong underlying organizational health. For customer loyalty, our ambition is for more than 50 % of the business segments of our entities to be or become rated by their customers as a \"loyalty leader\" in terms of the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS) by 2024. In terms of employee engagement, our ambition is to score above 75 % on the Inclusive Meritocracy Index. At the same time, we have also set the target to become a clear leader in sustainability and diversity.\n\n### **Our business strategy**\n\nTo implement these strategic objectives, to realize our growth ambition, and to accelerate our value creation, we have defined five additional strategic areas of focus:\n\n− Transforming the Life/Health and Asset Management franchise: Fully address protection and savings needs and accelerate transformation to a capital-efficient model, leveraging our \n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nstrengths in Asset Management to deliver investor-defined risk/return requirements, through various investment disciplines.\n\n- − Expanding our Property & Casualty leadership position: Beat the best players in each market, building on productivity gains and scale, in retail motor and beyond.\n- − Boosting growth through scalable platforms: Scale our customerfacing platforms and build new operating platforms to grow our business volume and margin.\n- − Deepening the global vertical integration and execution of agility: Verticalize operating models across lines of business to unleash value from our skills and scale.\n- − Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience: Retain industryleading financial strength and unlock further value creation potential through an improved risk/return profile and an active management and reduction of tail-risk exposure. Our focus on capital resilience is matched with a focus on talent development and diversity that also strengthens our organizational resilience.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on ensuring the integrity of the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\nOur financial strength renders us resilient against market stress, while our ongoing transformation creates capabilities allowing us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment. For example:\n\n- − We are continuously simplifying our products and processes, harmonizing them across our businesses to consequently exploit economies of scale.\n- − We scale our customer-facing platforms (e.g., Mobility, Health, and Travel) and integrate our business models with digital marketplaces for customers and business partners (e.g., claims).\n- − Building on a strong customer base, a deep understanding of customer needs, and excellence in distribution, we strive to achieve customer loyalty leadership in all countries we operate in.\n- − In fast-growing regions, including Asia-Pacific, we are wellpositioned to capture growth opportunities from increasing customer demand for Health & Protection.\n- − Worldwide, there is growth potential from providing our asset management clients (institutional and retail) with opportunities to invest in both private and public markets, pursue returns commensurate with their stated risk appetites, and engage in various investment strategies, be they equity, fixed income or alternatives.\n- − Building on our strong footprint in Europe, we aim to profit from ongoing consolidations, transform the capital productivity of in force businesses, and gain market share in previously unexploited markets.\n- − Together with our partners, we capture opportunities in bancassurance as well as future embedded insurance solutions across products and geographies, tapping into new customer segments.\n- − We are enhancing Allianz's unit-linked platform by converging the Group factory expertise from Life Insurance and Asset Management.\n- − We are focusing on sustainability by realizing ESG-based investment products, social value-added insurance coverages (e.g., flood, earthquake, and storm) and health prevention products (e.g., oncological).\n\nIn a continuously evolving market where the demands of customers constantly change, our knowledge of the industry and our expertise in product development and risk management offers us great opportunities to create timely customer-focused solutions.\n\n### **Supervisory Board and Board of Management**\n\nOur approach to risk governance permits the integrated management of local and global risks and ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and groupwide responsibilities.\n\nThe Board of Management formulates business objectives and sets a corresponding business strategy, risk strategy, and investment strategy. It also defines risk limits and allocates risk capital to the business activities within the Allianz Group. The core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Management. The Board of Management reports to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management activities. The following committees support the Board and the Supervisory Board on risk issues:\n\n### **Supervisory Board Risk Committee**\n\nThe Supervisory Board Risk Committee reports to the Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk management framework. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as general risks and specific risk exposures, and ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the paragraph \"Risk Committee\" in the [Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0)\n\n### **Group Finance and Risk Committee**\n\nIn the context of the Group's Committee Framework, the Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) reports to the Board of Management and provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limit-setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Management, and approves major financing and capital management transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including strategic asset allocation for the different business segments.\n\n#### **Overall risk organization and roles in risk management**\n\nA comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved via the Policy Framework by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appetite, limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of riskrelated information (e.g., to the Board of Management via the Management Reporting) and a disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution at both the global level (Board of Management of Allianz SE) and local levels (i.e., the Operating and Legal Entities).\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Three Lines of Defense model, as a general principle, the responsibility for the First Line of Defense rests with business managers in the related undertaking. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. The Second Line of Defense is made up of independent global oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board of Management in defining the risk frameworks within which the business can operate. Group Audit forms the Third Line of Defense, independently and regularly reviewing risk governance implementation, compliance with risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our internal control system, all functions are obliged to cooperate and exchange necessary information and advice. Given that control activities may be exercised by staff in different organizational units, appropriate mechanisms are in place between the control functions to allow fully informed and educated decision-making.\n\n#### **Group Risk Management function**\n\nGroup Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer, who also serves as the Chief Risk Officer of Allianz SE. Group Risk supports Allianz SE's Board of Management, including its committees, by performing various analyses, communicating information related to risk management, and preparing and implementing committee decisions.\n\nGroup Risk also supports the Board of Management in developing the risk management framework – which covers risk governance, risk strategy and appetite – and risk monitoring and reporting. Group Risk's operational responsibility encompasses assessing risks across all risk categories and monitoring limits and accumulations ofspecific risks across businesslines, including natural and human-caused (regulatory terminology: man-made) disasters and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.\n\nGroup Risk strengthens and maintains the Group's risk network through regular and close interaction with the management of related undertakings and with other key stakeholders, such as the local finance, risk, actuarial, underwriting, and investment departments. A strong group-wide risk network enables the Allianz Group to influence risk culture across the Group, identify risks at an early stage, and make management aware of these risks.\n\n#### **Related undertakings**\n\nRelated undertakings are responsible for their own risk management, including adherence to both external requirements (for example, those imposed by local regulators) and internal standards. Their Boards of Management are responsible for setting and approving a local risk strategy − supporting the Group's risk strategy − during the annual Strategic and Planning Dialogues with the Group and for ensuring adherence to their risk strategy.\n\nThe insurance and asset management operations of our related undertakings are subject to regular reviews in the context of the groupwide internal risk management and control system. The control measures are accompanied by local Risk Management functions, headed by Chief Risk Officers, which are independent from business line management. The Risk Management functions run riskmonitoring and -controlling processes, locally set up by the respective entities. Furthermore, the local activities are subject to additional reviews by regional entities, or the Allianz Asset Management GmbH for asset management. This ensures the adherence to Group requirements and the related reporting. A local Risk Committee supports both the Board of Management (or an equivalent executive committee) and the Chief Risk Officer by acting as the primary risk monitoring and controlling body.\n\nConsistent implementation of the Group's risk management framework in the related undertakings, including regular dialogue between the Group and the entity, is ensured, for example, through Group Risk representation on local Risk Committees (or equivalent), and through regular assessment of the appropriateness of the local risk management framework and performance of the Chief Risk Officers by Group Risk. Moreover, the Group Chief Risk Officer must be consulted on decisions regarding the staffing, objectives, and performance evaluation of local Chief Risk Officers. To further enhance the regular dialogue at management level focusing on the internal control environment, the Group is implementing the Governance and Controls Dialogue as one key instrument that should further enhance the already existing strong strategic and financial planning procedures known as the Strategic Dialogue and the Planning Dialogue. The Governance and Controls Dialogue will be enabled by an integrated Governance and Controls Dashboard, to assure a holistic overview of the risk landscape as well as external factors that may be potential risk drivers.\n\n#### **Other functions and bodies**\n\nIn addition to Group Risk and the local Risk Management functions, legal, compliance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and the entity levels constitute additional components of the Second Line of Defense.\n\nGroup Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition, Group Compliance – in conjunction with Group Legal and other experts involved – is responsible for integrity management, which aims to protect the Allianz Group as well as Allianz SE and our other related undertakings and employees from regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nGroup Compliance has defined preventive, detective, and responsive controls for the assigned compliance risk areas, which are based on requirements specified in the compliance standards and Code of Conduct. A compliance control catalog, including the development of control objectives arising from the various corporate compliance guidelines, as well as a cataloging of normative risk scenarios and defined key control activities, are available.\n\nGroup Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing risks of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management system. The latter includes joining Group Risk in a discipline to regularly monitor internal risk capital models, assumptions, and parameters – as well as their changes. It also includes providing support regarding capital efficiency management, contributing to the modeling of insurance risk capital, and supporting the identification of underwriting risks via independent reserve reviews.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Risk-based steering and risk management[1](#page-134-0)\n\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks, including market, credit, underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\nAllianz's Asset Management business segment is primarily exposed to operational risk, reputational risk, and business risk. Market and credit risk are primarily borne by the segment's underlying investors, be they internal or third-party clients.\n\nWe consider diversification across different business segments, lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any disproportionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the Group, our risk profile is measured and steered based on our approved Solvency II internal model<sup>2</sup>. We have introduced a target solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.\n\nUnlike the insurance business, which is balance-sheet sensitive, our Asset Management business is mainly a cash flow business. Therefore, the risk of the Asset Management business segment is also analyzed through the impact of pre-defined material stress scenarios on the operating profit. These are one component in a system of key risk indicators for Asset Management and are regularly monitored. These risk limits are reviewed on a regular basis with First Line of Defense business owners, confirming the pre-assessments derived by the entity's Risk Management functions. These risk limits (sometimes called risk bearing capacity thresholds) are presented to the underlying Risk Committee and are ultimately ratified by the Audit Committees and/or Executive Management Boards.\n\nIn addition, central elements of Allianz's dividend policy are linked to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model. This helps us to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\n2\\_From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems our model to be \"partial\" because not all our entities use the internal model. Some of our smaller insurance entities report under the standard formula and others apply third country equivalence. For asset management, banking, and\n\nAllianz steers its business portfolio taking a comprehensive view of risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits based on our internal model. The Life/Health business segment is steered – in addition to the Return on Equity – by a return on risk capital[3](#page-134-0) (RoRC) approach for new business at the product level, while for the Property-Casualty business segment a return on equity (RoE insurance) at the portfolio level is used.\n\nRoRC and RoE insurance are indicators that allow us to identify profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis. For new Life/Health insurance business, RoRC reflects the expected average return against the capital commitment over the lifetime of the products and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions. For Property-Casualty insurance business, the RoE insurance reflects the return against the underlying equity which is allocated to the specific portfolios based on the respective risk capital requirements. This allows us to take appropriate risk-based decisions.\n\nConsistent with industry practices, the Asset Management business segment is measured on its efficiency based upon cost to income, i.e., the Cost Income Ratio (CIR).\n\nAs a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in the steering of the insurance business, and its application satisfies the socalled \"use test\" requirement under Solvency II.\n\nQualitative assessments as part of the Insurance and Asset Management risk framework include Top Risk Assessments, as well as group-challenged self-assessments and selected group reviews of the maturity of the local risk management systems and the adherence to the risk policy framework. Key results of the entities' qualitative risk assessments are reported to the Group on a regular basis.\n\nAs an inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums from our policyholders and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting investment portfolios back the future claims payments and benefits to our customers. In addition, we also invest shareholders' capital, which is required to support the business. Finally, we use derivatives, mostly to hedge our portfolio against adverse market movements (for example, protective puts) or to reduce our reinvestment risk (for example, by using forwards, swaps, or\n\nInstitutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), sectoral requirements are applied. Without loss of generality, we might use the term internal model in the following chapters, e.g., in case of descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on processes with respect to the internal model components.\n\n<span id=\"page-134-1\"></span><span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>swaptions). Asset/liability management (ALM) decisions are taken based on the internal model, considering both the risks and the returns on the financial market.\n\nAs the fair values of our investment portfolios and liabilities depend on the changes observed in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. The long-dated liabilities in our Life/Health business segment and those attributable to internal pensions contribute to interest rate risk, in particular when they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied volatilities, and currencies, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models[4](#page-134-1) for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the sorted portfolio profit and loss distribution at a certain confidence level (99.5 %) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR). For entities modeled using the standard formula, the market risk is based on aggregating the losses under specified standard formula shock scenarios.\n\nStrategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits – including stand-alone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits, and foreign exchange exposure limits – are defined for the Group, Allianz SE, and the other related undertakings. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include escalation to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nFurthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging activities, due to the exposure to fair-value options embedded in our life insurance products. In addition, we optimize our in-force portfolio through transactional levers, such as partly or entirely divesting discontinued products and businesses; structural levers, such as adjusting the product mix; and operational levers, such as partnering with specialists to manage these books of legacy products, also called life back books.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\\_The return on risk capital is defined as the present value of future real-world profits on the capital requirement (including buffer to regulatory requirements) held at the local level.\n\n<sup>4</sup>\\_Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic cash flow models, following IAS 19 principles.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, guidelines are provided by the Group regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives. Compliance with these guidelines is controlled by the risk and controlling functions at Allianz SE and the other operating entities.\n\nWith respect to investment assets of the Property-Casualty and Life/Health business segments managed by Allianz's asset managers, guidelines applicable to our insurance undertakings must be clearly elaborated as part of the asset managers' client investment guidelines. Notwithstanding the above, portfolios managed by Allianz's asset managers for the benefit of third-party investment clients must adhere to the investment frameworks and constraints as defined by and agreed with them.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nAllianz is a liability-driven investor. We may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts, if the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities. This risk is higher for long-dated life investment and savings products as well as for internal pensions, with a significant part of the Life/Health business segment's interest rate risk coming from Western Europe, mainly from traditional life insurance products with guarantees. Conversely, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our asset/liability management process and controlled via interest rate sensitivity and duration mismatch limits for the Group and the local entities.\n\n### **Inflation risk**\n\nWe are exposed to changing inflation rates, predominantly due to our Property-Casualty insurance obligations but also due to inflationindexed internal pension obligations. While inflation assumptions are taken into account in our underwriting, unexpected rising rates of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities; conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk that inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our internal model. Potential severe structural breaks are monitored via historical and ad-hoc stress tests. Measures have been taken to manage currently observed elevated inflation levels. On the Property-Casualty side, this includes continuous monitoring of claims inflation, sufficient provisioning, and timely adjustments of premium rates to reflect both actual and expected inflation.\n\n### **Equity risk**\n\nInsurance-focused Allianz entities may hold equity investments to diversify their portfolios and to take advantage of expected long-term returns. Strategic asset allocation benchmarks, investment and equity sensitivity limits are used to monitor and manage these exposures. In addition, equity investments fall within the scope of the credit risk platform to avoid single-name risk concentrations. Risks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As stock markets might also increase, opportunities may arise from equity investments in those events.\n\n### **Credit spread risk**\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liabilitydriven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity. This implies that we are less affected economically by short-term changes in market prices. In our capacity as a long-term investor, this gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component.\n\n### **Currency risk**\n\nAllianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group typically invest in assets which are denominated in the same currency as their liabilities. However, some foreign currency exposures are allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign currency risk comes from our non-euro Group companies: Whenever the euro strengthens, the euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsidiaries will decline from an Allianz Group and Allianz SE perspective; however, at the same time, the capital requirements in euro will decrease, partially mitigating the total impact on Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's capitalization. Based on the Allianz Group's foreign exchange management limit framework, currency risk is monitored and managed at the levels of the Allianz Group, Allianz SE, and the other operating entities of the Allianz Group.\n\n### **Real estate risk**\n\nDespite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suitable addition to our investment portfolio due to good diversification benefits, as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable, long-term cash flows.\n\nAllianz's Group Investment Committee has defined a framework for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real estate loan investments. These standards outline diversification targets, minimum-return thresholds, and other qualitative and quantitative requirements. All transactions that do not meet these standards or have a total investment volume (including costs) exceeding a defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group Risk and other Group center functions. In addition, all applicable limits must be respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset allocation as well as its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an investing entity's portfolio.\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties (\"migration risk\") or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (\"default risk\").\n\nThe Group's credit risk profile originates from three sources: our investment portfolio, our credit insurance business, and our external reinsurance.\n\n- − Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obligor. However, losses due to credit events can be shared with the policyholder for certain life insurance products.\n- − Credit insurance: Credit risk arises from potential claim payments on limits granted by Allianz Trade to its policyholders. Allianz Trade insures its policyholders against credit risk associated with short-term trade credits advanced to policyholder's clients. When the client of the policyholder is unable to meet its payment obligations, Allianz Trade indemnifies the loss to the policyholder.\n- − Reinsurance: Credit risk arises from potential losses from nonrecoverability of reinsurance receivables or due to default on benefits under in force reinsurance treaties. Our reinsurance partners are carefully selected by a dedicated team. Besides focusing on companies with strong credit profiles, we may also require letters of credit, cash deposits, funds withheld, or assets held in trust, or other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process. The central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies, and internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied.\n\nThe loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure concentrations per obligor segment. The loss profiles are calculated at different levels of the Allianz Group, and then fed into the internal model at each level for further aggregation across sources of risk to derive diversified credit risk.\n\nOur credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Allianz Trade, based on a proprietary model component which is a local adaptation of the central internal credit risk model. Allianz Trade's loss profile is integrated in the Group's internal credit risk model to capture the concentration and diversification effects.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CrisP<sup>1</sup>) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group, Allianz SE, and other operating-entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit actions and provides notification services featuring the quick and broad communication of credit-related decisions across the Group.\n\nClearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's perspective (i.e., the maximum concentration limit), which are adopted by Allianz SE and serve as maximum local limits for the other operating entities, takes into account the Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure as well as the overall risk strategy.\n\nApart from risks from internal pensions, underwriting risk consists of premium and reserve risks in the Property-Casualty business segment[2](#page-136-0) as well as biometric risks in the Life/Health business segment[3](#page-136-0) and underwriting risks are not relevant for the Asset Management business segment and our banking operations.\n\n### **Property-Casualty**\n\nThe Property-Casualty primary and reinsurance business of the Allianz Group is exposed to premium-risk-related adverse developments in the current year's new and renewed business, as well as to reserve risks related to the business in force.\n\n### **Premium risk**\n\nAs part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive premiums from our customers and provide insurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios. Premium risk can be mitigated by reinsurance as well as by technical excellence in underwriting. Assessing risks as part of the underwriting process is therefore a key element of our risk management framework. There are clear underwriting limits and restrictions which are defined centrally and applied across the Group.\n\nPremium risk is subdivided into three categories: natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate loss distribution models for attritional losses. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, and floods represent a significant challenge for risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses. Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror events and man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber incidents and industrial concentrations.\n\n<span id=\"page-136-0\"></span>These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n#### **Reserve risk**\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we would experience a gain or loss dependent on the assumptions applied for the estimate. In addition, the risk of inflation volatility deviating from historical observations and of changes in yield curves is covered in the specific market risk modules.\n\nSimilar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actuarial models. The reserve distributions derived are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of unexpected reserve volatility, Allianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group constantly monitor the development of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, related undertakings generally conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses and Group representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings.\n\nRetrocession is another important instrument to mitigate reserve risk.\n\n### **Life/Health**\n\nUnderwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks) include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life expectancies of the insured.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several parameters – such as assumptions on future mortality rates, or morbidity claims – the actual development may differ from the expected one. For example, lower-than-expected mortality rates would lead to additional annuity payments in the future. However, \n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nbeneficial deviations are also possible; for example, a trend towards healthier lifestyles will most likely result in lower overall health insurance claims.\n\nWe measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing, where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and pandemic risk scenarios on the other. Depending on the nature and complexity of the risks involved, our health business is represented in the internal model according to Property-Casualty or Life/Health calculation methods and is therefore included in the relevant Property-Casualty and Life/Health figures accordingly. However, most of our health business is attributable to the Life/Health business segment.\n\nBusiness risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks. They are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by the Property-Casualty and the Asset Management business. Cost risks are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering insurance policies – or investment management expenses for portfolio management – are higher than expected or that new business volume decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs. Business risk is measured relative to baseline plans.\n\nFor the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in exercising their contractual options, such as, for instance, early termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and annuity take-up options.\n\nAssumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with accepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment. These are used as a basis to determine the economic impact of policyholder behavior under different scenarios within our internal model.\n\nThe potential interaction between market risks (in particular interest rate risk) and lapse risk is covered by two different modeling aspects:\n\n− Financial rationality: The Life/Health cash flow models generally contain a dynamic modeling of lapse where the best estimate lapse rate is increased if market returns are significantly higher than the overall return of the insurance policy and vice versa.\n\n− Cross effects: This part takes into account that a combined impact of a market rate change and a lapse rate change could deviate significantly from the sum of the two impacts.\n\nOperational risks refer to losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, including the following:\n\n- − \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\": potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations or from the design of products. Examples include mis-selling, non-compliance with internal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These losses tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have a high financial (and reputational) impact.\n- − \"Execution, Delivery, and Process Management\": potential losses arising from transaction or process management failures. Examples include interest and penalties from non-payment or underpayment of taxes, or losses associated with broker and agent distribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher frequency but with little financial impact (although single large-loss events can occur).\n- − Other operational risks including, for example, internal or external fraud, financial misstatement risk, IT risks (such as a cybersecurity incident causing limited availability, loss of confidentiality or integrity, or regulatory fines[1](#page-137-0)), IT-related risks (such as improper delivery/design or operational stability), a potential failure at our outsourcing partners causing a disruption to our working environment, etc.\n\nIn the last year, the following two operational risks related to IT have gained in importance in particular:\n\nThe first operational risk results from fast developments in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) including generative AI. AI can help Allianz to further improve customer services and internal processes but also comes with new operational risks: Public and regulatory concerns about discriminating AI and \"Black Box AI\" triggered various regulatory initiatives by supervisory authorities and regulators across the globe, especially the upcoming European Union AI Act, which is expected to be finalized in 2024. Allianz addresses these new legal and reputational risks seriously with its AI governance framework, <span id=\"page-137-0\"></span>which is already rolled out in various OEs. It basically includes a practical guidance for AI promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, human agency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI solutions. Privacy and ethics impact assessments help to implement these AI principles on a case-by-case basis. These activities are supported by various training and awareness campaigns for Allianz employees, and by a data advisory board preparing decisions for the Board of Management in the area of AI and data ethics. The Allianz AI governance framework will be further adjusted, especially to implement the European Union AI Act in its final version, and structurally rolled out in the operating entities.\n\nThe second operational risk is compliance with rising regulatory requirements on the management of IT risks. In the second quarter 2022, BaFin conducted an audit on the implementation of the supervisory requirements for insurance on IT (VAIT) at Allianz SE, with the new version published on 3 March 2022. To address the findings, Allianz SE has set up a program under the lead of the division \"Operations, IT and Organization\" and approved and submitted to BaFin a corresponding remediation plan. The remediation plan has been accepted by BaFin.\n\nAdditional recent examples are the European Commission's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and similar requirements from local regulators relevant for the Allianz Group. To achieve compliance with the large number of very granular DORA standards, an extensive program coordinated by Group Protection & Resilience was initiated during 2023. The program aims to implement adequate solutions by January 2025, when the requirements set by the act need to be effectively met by Allianz. Group Risk is participating in the project and is actively involved in contributing to the design required by DORA.\n\nIn the last year, one operational risk related to IT has reduced in importance. The project risk related to the Allianz Group's IT transformation program, which aimed at accelerating complexity reduction and achieving additional synergy effects and cost savings in IT, was reduced due to formal closure of the program and transfer of remaining activities to a local project in the Asia region. The program was supported with a tailored risk assessment approach, which will now happen in a similar way for the local project. Risks at all levels of the program – at operating entities, business areas and the global program – were independently identified, assessed, and will – where necessary – continue to be managed, and monitored in a harmonized way.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allianz Group's operational risk primarily refers to losses in either the insurance or the asset management business, or both.\n\nThe Group's operational risk capital is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the categories \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\" and \"Execution, Delivery, and Process Management\". With regard to the largest category \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\", key external drivers are changes in laws and regulations. Internal drivers reflect potential failures of internal processes. These drivers are considered in the local scenario analyses.\n\nOperational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based approach based on expert judgment, as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz has developed a consistent operational risk management framework, which is applied across the Group based on proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles and responsibilities as well as management processes and methods: Local risk managers at Allianz SE and at the other operating entities of the Allianz Group, in their capacity as Second Line of Defense, identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies via a dialogue with the First Line of Defense, report operational risk events in a central database, and ensure that the framework is implemented in their respective operating entity.\n\nThis framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and dedicated compliance programs monitored by compliance functions across the Allianz Group. The risk of financial misstatement is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management programs to protect critical business functions from these events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cybersecurity, cyber insurance that Allianz buys from third-party insurers, and a variety of ongoing control activities, developed and implemented along the following main themes: slow down hackers, increase threat detection, reduce the damage of attacks, and enhance the skills as well as the organizational structure.\n\nWith regards to the last year, in particularIT risk management and information and cybersecurity were further improved via implementation of the following strategic themes, which were derived from both observed and anticipated risks, considering the strategic outlook of information security, the threat landscape, and industry trends: (1) protection of digital identity, (2) security service health, (3) cyber resilience.\n\nDue to the particular importance of operational risks for the Asset Management business, a key task for the local Risk Management functions in the related entities is a regular monitoring of the internal controls attached to material processes. This is also supported by the introduction of the concept on Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM).\n\nThe ICS for operational risk encompasses the management of compliance, financial reporting, and other operational risks. The effectiveness of this internal control system is monitored along two dimensions:\n\n- − Monitoring the effective implementation of the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) framework, which is progressively replacing the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) framework. If correctly implemented, these frameworks ensure that risks are identified in time, and controls are appropriately set up and tested frequently to identify potential weaknesses or gaps in the internal control system.\n- − Monitoring the resolution of identified weaknesses in the internal control system.\n\nNFRM strengthens the internal control system by using a new risk taxonomy consistent across the Group, which helps to aggregate the risks at Group level, and by using an even more rigorous testing approach. It is being rolled out in so-called waves with close monitoring by Group Risk and Group Compliance. Insurance and Asset Management entities of the first two waves – 44 operating entities out of 67 – have already undergone important implementation steps in 2023 to further bolster assurance activities. Operating entities part of the last wave 3 have continued to apply the IRCS framework and will implement NFRM in 2024.\n\nThe full implementation of the new framework across the Group is expected to be completed by year-end 2024. Meanwhile, Group Risk and Group Compliance are closely monitoring all waves, seamlessly bridging an effective migration between IRCS and NFRM.\n\nThe NFRM is an integral part of the overall ICS, whose fundamentals are described in the section \"Risk Governance System and Internal Control System\".\n\nThe NFRM is the framework by which the Second Line of Defense supports and facilitates the fulfillment of First Line of Defense responsibility to implement an adequate and effective system for managing Non-Financial Risks. The NFRM aims to strengthen the control system by using a harmonized methodology to:\n\n- − Achieve a consistent and commonly accepted definition of risks that fall under the category Non-Financial Risk, via establishing a set of non-financial risk vectors.\n- − Facilitate the implementation of adequate controls via an NFRM control catalog, consisting of control objectives, risk scenarios, and exemplary key controls.\n- − Ensure a robust testing of these controls, using a systematic riskbased approach.\n\nTo achieve these targets, NFRM has connected and evolved already existing pillars and tools of the Allianz Risk Management and Internal Control System framework, e.g., the Top Risk Assessment (TRA) methodology, the Integrated Risk and Control (IRCS) framework, and the use of internal and external operational loss events.\n\nThe NFRM framework has the following key features:\n\n- − Objective data is used through a consistent methodology to facilitate a baseline assessment of non-financial risks.\n- − An assessment of top non-financial risks prioritizes risks to better allocate resources.\n- − A process-level view is used to approach risks and controls from a business view, and to facilitate integrated assurance.\n- − Standardized key controls are defined to support compliance and risk management by design, and to enforce integrated assurance and testing rigor.\n\nFundamental to the NFRM is the concept of a holistic approach. While there are several different sources of operational risks, the process towards the management of the risks always follows the same core principle. This is that operational risks must be identified, assessed, and prioritized, and underlying mitigating controls have to be effective. This is the basic premise behind establishing an integrated approach.\n\nAt the Allianz Group level, it is important to monitor the quality of the local implementation of this framework as a means of ensuring that internal control system weaknesses are identified prior to the occurrence of operational risk events (ex-ante).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo fulfill this objective, Allianz relies on a methodology known as the OE control environment rating. The OE control environment rating evaluates the effectiveness of the framework at the operating entity level by leveraging several sources of data and KPIs, which are then further enhanced via certain qualitative criteria.\n\nAdditionally, an Allianz group-wide Executive Accountability Regime (EAR) is in place to further support the integration of risk management into business processes. It is essential that the Board of Management demonstrates a strong risk culture to support this integration – they lead by example in order to make clear throughout the business that the management of risks is an important factor when it comes to the achievement of business objectives.\n\nFor a selection of key executives, the EAR formalizes clear accountability and ownership for risk management through tailored individual accountability statements, which concretely outline rolespecific responsibilities to reinforce the Allianz purpose and strategy in thinking and behavior across Allianz, as well as to mitigate key risks. In addition, to reinforce these accountabilities amongst business leaders, compliance with internal and external regulations as well as vigilance in living the Group's risk culture is taken into account when determining performance. In 2023, the EAR has been further enhanced to include a minimum set of clearly defined key indicators to measure OE management's timely responsiveness in the areas of Risk, Compliance, Legal, Data Privacy, Audit, and People & Culture. These quantitative indicators are complemented with a holistic qualitative assessment.\n\nThere are risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital. These risks are therefore not considered in the internal model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risk.\n\n### **Strategic risk**\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's Top Risk Assessment process and discussed in various Board of Management-level committees (for example, GFRC). We also monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe most important strategic risks are related to the value creation levers, which focus on three themes: Growth, Margin Expansion, and Capital Efficiency. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the value creation leversis monitored and evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogues between the Allianz Group and Allianz SE and the other related undertakings.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows.\n\nThe liquidity risk profile of Allianz predominantly originates from the uncertainty about the volume and timing of cash needs from insurances liabilities. This relates especially to:\n\n- − Coverage of various types of catastrophes in the Property-Casualty business, with the frequency of such events anticipated to increase going forward as a result of the unfolding climate change effects.\n- − Mass lapse events or rising lapse rates in the Life/Health insurance business, especially in combination with changes in the relevant capital market environment.\n\nMajor risks can also result from derivative transactions used by Allianz to hedge specific market risks.\n\nAllianz is exposed to liquidity risk as well due to large operational risk events, which may potentially result in significant cash outflows.\n\nAnother source of liquidity risk for Allianz are potential regulatory actions by local supervisors, which may reduce dividends from subsidiaries to the Group (e.g., due to global events such as those partially observed during the COVID-19 crisis).\n\nEach legal entity of the Allianz Group measures and manages liquidity risk locally, using asset/liability management systems designed to ensure that assets and liabilities are adequately matched. Local investment strategies particularly focus on the quality of the investments and ensure a significant portion of liquid assets (e.g., highrated government bonds or covered bonds) in the portfolios. In the course of the liquidity planning, liquidity sources (e.g., cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (e.g., payments due to insurance claims and expenses) are reconciled under a best-estimate plan, as well as under adverse idiosyncratic and systemic liquidity scenarios with time horizons of up to 12 months, to allow for a consistent view on liquidity risk across the Group. These analyses are predominantly performed at legal entity level and are monitored by the Group for large- and mid-sized units.\n\nThe annual and the high-level three-year cash flow plan for Allianz SE and the Holding and Treasury reportable segment reflect the overall operating, financing, and investing strategy of the Allianz Group. The liquidity stress-testing framework of Allianz SE is identical to that of the other legal entities. Major contingent liquidity requirements arise mainly from market risk scenarios for Allianz SE and its subsidiaries, from the non-availability of external capital markets, and from reinsurance risk scenarios for Allianz SE.\n\nIn addition, the cash position of the Group cash pool investment portfolio is monitored and forecast on a daily basis.\n\nIn the liquidity risk measurement process, early warning and limit thresholds are applied to regularly measure the local (stressed) liquidity position, inform senior management, and decide on actions if needed.\n\nThe management of Allianz's liquidity risk at a local level is facilitated by a dedicated governance and organizational setup. In general, the First Line of Defense is responsible for managing liquidity risk. Monitoring of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the local Risk Management functions, and potential liquidity gaps are reported to the respective local boards of management.\n\n### **Reputational risk**\n\nAllianz's reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas such as product quality, corporate governance, financial performance, customer service, employee relations, intellectual capital, and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the Allianz SE share price, the value of the in-force business, or the value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in the eyes of internal or external stakeholders.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the annual Top Risk Assessment process, undertaken by the Allianz Group and all operating entities. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk strategy for the most significant risks and their potential reputational impact.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **ESG risks**\n\nEnvironmental, social or governance events and conditions (ESG factors), such as climate change, loss of biodiversity or human rights abuses, are increasingly becoming a relevant source of adverse impacts on our balance sheet, profitability or reputation. These ESGrelated risks are characterized by their transversal nature, meaning they may materialize within any of Allianz's existing risk categories (e.g., market risk, underwriting risk, operational risk) as either a consequence of societal responses to ESG factors – including regulatory changes, litigation, technological developments and changes in human behavior – or due to events causing physical damage, such as droughts, floods or storms, whereby the magnitude or likelihood is attributable to an ESG factor.\n\nAllianz's strategy for the management of these risks begins with establishing a comprehensive understanding of all the ways ESG factors can trigger adverse events within the investment, underwriting, and operations areas of our business, as well as from a broader reputational perspective. For this purpose, a dedicated ESG risk inventory has been established and a corresponding risk assessment performed, which enables us to take a risk-based view in terms of evaluating the adequacy of mitigation measures in place.\n\nESG-related mitigation measures may vary substantially, depending on the precise nature of the underlying risk, ranging from establishment of specific controls at the business process level through to adjustments in Allianz's long-term business strategy. Given that all adverse impacts attributable to ESG factors are ultimately realized within one of Allianz's existing risk categories, we aim – to the greatest extent possible – to embed the identification and management of these risks directly within risk management processes already in place.\n\nAt the Group level, the GFRC is responsible for overseeing ESGrelated risks. In addition, a Group Sustainability Board is in place, which is responsible for Allianz's overall ESG strategy and for steering the integration of ESG aspects into core investment and insurance activities.\n\nFor a broader perspective on our key ESG integration processes, please refer to the sections \"Sustainability integration approach\" and \"Transition plan and strategy\" in th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0) \n\nWith respect to consideration of ESG risks in the management of third-party assets, our asset managers AllianzGI and PIMCO each have their own global ESG framework, which supports their clientderived objectives of ESG investing, while complying with globally and locally relevant rules and regulations.\n\n### **Climate change**\n\nWithin the broad scope of ESG, climate change is currently the ESG factor of primary emphasis, both in terms of regulatory focus and potential to materially influence our risk profile over a short- to midterm and long-term horizon. Commensurate with this emphasis, an assessment of Allianz's climate change-related risks has been conducted during 2023, including both a qualitative risk assessment following the structure of the ESG risk inventory, as well as quantitative scenario analyses and stress-testing.\n\nFor information about the climate change risk management methodology, the outcome of the assessments and next steps, please refer to the section \"Climate-related risks\" in th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n## Internal risk capital framework[1](#page-140-0)\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization. We calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk capital across all business segments on a quarterly basis. We also regularly project risk capital requirements between reporting periods in times of financial market turbulence.\n\nFor the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules in that it comprises our approved internal model covering Allianz SE and all other major insurance operations. Other entities are reflected based on standard formula results, others under the deduction and aggregation approach as well as on sectoral requirements (e.g., Asset Management) or local requirements for non-insurance operations, in accordance with the Solvency II framework.\n\n### **Internal model**\n\nOur internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss of portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe <span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>(\"holding period\", set at one year) and probability of occurrence (\"confidence level\", set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories (\"sources of risk\") modeled and calculate the portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mitigating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe risk capital required is defined as the difference between the current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we consider the impact of a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and in aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios representing historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests on a monthly basis to reflect current political and financial developments, and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.\n\n### **Coverage of the risk capital calculations**\n\nThe Allianz Group's internal model to calculate our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) covers all major insurance operations[2](#page-140-0). This includes both relevant assets (including fixed income, equities, real estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all current and planned technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt, and other liabilities). For with-profit products in the Life/Health business segment, the options and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts – including policyholder behavior – are taken into account.\n\nSmaller related undertakings in the European Economic Area which are not covered by the internal model are reflected with their standard formula results. Until the third quarter 2023, the Solvency Capital Requirements for certain smaller insurance undertakings outside the European Economic Area with only immaterial impact on the Group's risk profile were accounted for at the level of Allianz Group by means of book value deduction[3](#page-140-0). Due to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter 2023, the book value deduction approach is no longer used for these entities. Instead, the contribution of the solvency capital requirement from these entities to the Group is derived through experience values from the standard model, in alignment with the regulator.\n\n3\\_Under book value deduction, the book value of the respective entity is deducted from eligible Own Funds of the Group.\n\n[1](#page-142-0)\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the notes to \n2\\_Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America is based on third-country equivalence. the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk capital related to our European banking operations is allocated to the Corporate and Other business segment and calculated based on the approach applied by banks in accordance with the local requirements resulting from the Basel regulation (Basel standards). As the impact on the Group's total Solvency Capital Requirement is minor, risk management for the banking operations is not discussed in greater detail.\n\nFor our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal risk capital requirements based on sectoral regulatory capital requirements.\n\nIn view of the above, Allianz's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks not specifically covered by the internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n### **Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment**\n\nWhen calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assumptions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in determining and discounting future cash flows. For liability valuation, we apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to extrapolate the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor.\n\nIn addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility adjustment (VA) in most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows of our insurance liabilities are largely predictable. The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nWe take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful for long-term investors than the default risk. Allianz also models the volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model, which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard formula. For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA would react in practice; however, we base the movement on our own portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio. To account for this deviation, Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment. Validation is performed regularly to verify the appropriateness and prudency of the approach.\n\n### **Valuation assumptions: replicating portfolios**\n\nWe replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business. This technique enables us to represent all product-related options and guarantees, both contractual and discretionary, by means of standard financial instruments. In the risk calculation, we use the replicating portfolio − together with a Least Square Monte Carlo approach for risks that are not covered by the replication − to determine and revalue these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios.\n\n### **Diversification and correlation assumptions**\n\nAs Allianz is an integrated financial services provider offering a variety of products across different business segments and geographic regions, diversification is key to our business model.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors include regions (e.g., windstorm in Australia vs. windstorm in Germany), risk categories (e.g., market risk vs. underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (e.g., commercial vs. personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ultimately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the investment or (re)insurance products in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event in Australia can be considered to be highly independent of a change in credit spreads for a French government bond held as investment.\n\nThe internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results at the Group level, Allianz SE level, or at the level of other Group companies. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nWhere possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering observations over more than a decade. In cases where historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correlations are set by the Correlation Settings Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judgment, we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n### **Actuarial assumptions**\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior, expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, additionally considering recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. Our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework incorporates comprehensive processes and controls to ensure the reliability of these assumptions.\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for example, in an unprecedented crisis or as a possible result of severe structural breaks resulting from climate change, our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore, we validate the model and parameters through sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. To ensure that the model is validated adequately, we have established an Independent Validation Unit (IVU) within Group Risk, responsible for validating our internal model within a comprehensive model validation process. Any limitations identified during the validation process are remedied after consultation with the Group regulator. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nThe construction and application of the replicating portfolios mentioned are subject to the set of replicating instruments that are available and might be too simple or restrictive to capture all factors affecting the change in value of liabilities. As with other model components, the replication framework is subject to independent \n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nvalidation and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data and process quality controls. Therefore, we believe that our liabilities are adequately represented by the replicating portfolios.\n\nSince the internal model takes into account the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible – notably in distressed financial markets – to either obtain a current market price or to apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nIn 2023, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in the course of our consultations with regulators.\n\nThe net impact of regulatory and model changes on the Solvency II risk capital of the Group in 2023 was € 2.9 bn.\n\n#### The most important changes are:\n\n- − Inclusion of capital requirements for certain previously not modeled minor non-EEA insurance entities[1](#page-142-0), including currency risk (impact: € 3.0 bn).\n- − Change in the modeling of contingent capital reinsurance at Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG (€ 0.2 bn).\n- − Dynamic inflation extrapolation, which improves the inflation modeling by refining both the coverage of the term structure and the extrapolation to the central bank's long-term inflation target (€ (0.3) bn).\n\n<span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>In addition, in an effort to enhance the explanatory power of the risk capital movement analyses, our approach for allocating the risk capital from Group insurance entities which are modeled based on the Solvency II standard formula was improved. In the refined approach, the risk contributions to single risk categories are better aligned to the risk profile of the standard formula entities, and the diversification as well as the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes in the standard formula are more appropriately reflected. The change in the allocation approach does not impact the total SCR of the Allianz Group, but it increases all contributions of these standard formula entities to the single risk categories.\n\nIn all subsequent sections, the figures including model changes will form the basis for the movement analyses of our risk profile in 2023.

This is partially offset by the SCR reduction due to the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change.\n\nOverall, these model change result in a € 3.2 bn higher market risk of the Allianz Group at € 26.0 bn (2022: € 22.8 bn).\n\n### **Credit risk and operational risk**\n\nThe higher credit risk, and operational risk figures at Allianz Group level are mainly driven by the improved approach for allocating risk capital from major Group standard formula entities to the risk categories.\n\nThe minor model changes in 2023 do not have a material impact on credit risk and operational risk.\n\n### **Underwriting risk and business risk**\n\nFor underwriting risk and business risk, the higher figures at Allianz Group level are mainly resulting from the improved approach for the allocation of risks from standard formula entities.\n\nThe minor model changes in 2023 do not materially impact underwriting risk and business risk.\n\n### **Diversification benefits and tax relief**\n\nThe higher diversification benefits and tax relief figures are due to the explicit reflection of diversification benefits and the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes from the standard formula entities.\n\n### **Capital add-on**\n\nThe reduction in the capital add-on is mainly due to a decrease in the replicating portfolio add-on due to the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change.\n\n### **Minor non-EEA insurance entities**\n\nDue to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter 2023, the book value deduction approach will no longer be used for certain minor non-EEA insurance entities. Instead, a value for the contribution of solvency capital requirements from these entities to the Group is derived from an approach based on experience values from the standard formula calculations for the Allianz Group, which has been aligned with the regulator.\n\n### **Impact of model changes on Eligible Group Own Funds**\n\nAs a result of regulatory and model changes, we registered a € 7.3 bn increase of Own Funds after tax in 2023, mainly driven by the change for the minor non-EEA insurance entities that were formerly included via book-value-deduction in the amount of € 6.3 bn.\n\nThe remaining impacts of central, minor and immaterial model changes are mainly driven by Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG.\n\n### **Impacts of transitional measures**\n\nThe continued application of transitional measures on technical provisions for Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG resulted in an increase in the Own Funds of € 10.2 bn at the Group level.\n\n# Allianz risk profile and management assessment[1](#page-143-0)\n\nAllianz's core business as a global insurer and asset manager predominantly exposes it to a variety of risks such as underwriting risks, financial market and credit risks, and several other non-financial risks (i.e., operational, reputational, liquidity, and strategic risks). The execution of the strategic objectives may impact the potential severity or likelihood of these existing risks, contribute towards concentrations of certain types of risk, or potentially even give rise to new risks within a given risk category. However, from a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of Allianz has remained and is expected to remain stable. \"Stable\" in this context means a relatively high exposure to financial risks (i.e., the sum of financial market and credit risks), a moderate exposure to underwriting risks, and a modest exposure to operational, business, and other risks (i.e., measured as a share of the Allianz Group's Solvency II risk capital). Please refer to section \"Solvency II Regulatory Capitalization\" for further details.\n\n<span id=\"page-143-0\"></span>To support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, the Allianz Group has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- − Financial risks: The Allianz Group's ultimate objective is to assure that financial risk taking is in line with risk-bearing capacity at the Group and legal entity level, and that it creates shareholder equity. To manage financial risk effectively and avoid accumulated losses in times of financial crisis, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks inherent in the investment portfolios and in insurance products, including the development of new products.\n- − Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are required to serve customers and generate shareholder value. Quality control mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to Allianz's underwriting standards and monitor the quality of the portfolio and underwriting process. The underwriting processes must support sustainable and profitable business, secure consistency, align with the risk appetite of the Group and of the operating entities as well as avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations.\n- − Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to the core business and need to be carefully managed via continuous improvements in risk identification, risk assessment, and control environments. This occurs through elements of the Group Risk management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), Reputational Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\nAllianz faces a challenging financial market and operating environment. Markets are characterized by the risk of persistently high volatility. Interest rates have further increased, reflecting continued monetary policy tightening by key central banks to counter current inflation rates and long-term inflation expectations being above central banks' long-term inflation targets. Bonds and equity markets are fragile, as inflation and economic growth prospects for Europe and the United States are still impacted by repercussions from the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nand there is the risk of further global political and economic destabilization.\n\nLasting geopolitical and new regional political crises dominate the political and economic agenda. There is no clear resolution on the horizon for the lasting war in Ukraine. In addition, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza risks escalating into a regional military conflict with the involvement of Iran and the U.S., encompassing new risks for energy prices and inflation. Furthermore, there is the risk of a deterioration in the United States-China relationship, as well as of a further hardening of China's attitudes towards Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the geopolitical crises, there are several other factors that may lead to a persistent high financial market volatility. Lasting momentum for populist and radical parties in the Americas, in Europe, and around the globe could make international cooperation and coordination more challenging and complex, leading to a lower chance of impactful political action on geopolitical and regional crises, as well as on issues such as climate change, due to conflicting objectives. The risk factors also include further disruptions to global supply chains, which weigh on global trade, with the potential to prompt long-term structural shifts in these chains. Lasting risk factors include the challenges of implementing long-term structural reforms in key eurozone countries.\n\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies, combined with the rising use of artificial intelligence, increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyberattacks, data breaches, system failures, negative impacts from the use of deepfake tools on political and business processes, as well as the risk of non-compliance with increasing regulation covering IT-related business processes.\n\nTherefore, we continue to closely monitor political, financial and technological developments as well as the global trade situation to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.\n\nOur approved partial internal model has been applied since the beginning of 2016 when Solvency II came into effect. There is some uncertainty whether the provisional equivalence of the U.S. solvency regime for Solvency II purposes will be extended beyond 2025, as well as about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential introduction of future global capital requirements and from the current Solvency II review.\n\nThe Solvency II concept of \"equivalence\" allows third country solvency regimes to be recognized and used for Solvency II purposes. Most relevant for Allianz today, it allows the integration of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America into the Group capital calculation based on U.S. solvency requirements. The current provisional equivalent treatment of the U.S. expires at the end of 2025 and there is some risk that the equivalence will not be extended beyond 2025, with a potential negative impact on the solvency ratio of the Allianz Group.\n\nThe framework for potential future capital requirements for Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) is yet to be finalized by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nIn addition, in recent years, the European Commission reviewed the Solvency II directive as foreseen in European legislation. The review has been politically agreed by the trilogue parties (European Commission, European Parliament, and European Council) in December 2023, and the final text of the directive is expected to be published in the official journal of the European Union in the second or the third quarter of 2024. The corresponding update of Level 2 legislation (Solvency II regulation) as well as EIOPA guidelines will be performed by the European Commission and EIOPA during 2024 and 2025 and will cover outstanding technical details as delegated by the directive. The application of the new rules will start 24 months after their publication in the official journal of the European Union, i.e., for the second quarter of 2026 at the earliest.\n\nFinally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements based on a parallel application of a global capital framework (Insurance Capital Standard – ICS) as well as Solvency II could increase operational complexity and costs.\n\nThe management feels comfortable with the Group's overall risk profile and capitalization level. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- − Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well capitalized and has met its internal, rating agency, and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2023. Allianz remains one of the most highly rated insurance groups in the world, as reflected by our external ratings.\n- − The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Asset Management business segments, leading to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n- − Allianz is well-positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events such as those related to the ongoing war in Ukraine – due to our strong internal limit framework, stress testing, internal model, and risk management practices.\n- − Furthermore, the Group has the additional advantage of being well-diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of businesses and products.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, we expect to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement. However, Allianz is carefully monitoring the development of the war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions and regional political crises in particular, and manages its portfolios to ensure that the Group, Allianz SE, and the other Group companies have sufficient resources to meet their solvency capital needs.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Own Funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach, which is consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II[1](#page-145-0). Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization1**\n\n| As of 31 December    |      | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Own Funds            | € bn | 89.6 | 77.9 |\n| Capital requirement  | € bn | 43.5 | 38.8 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    | 206  | 201  |\n\n1\\_Excluding the application of transitional measures on technical provisions.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Allianz had been granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions for the two entities Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG. As of 31 December 2023 and including the application of transitional measures on technical provisions, the Own Funds and SCR amounted to € 99.7 bn and € 43.5 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 229 %. Our general capital steering, however, continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the application of transitional measures on technical provisions. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude transitional measures unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe following table summarizes our Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratios disclosed over the course of the year 2023:\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratios**\n\n| %                    | 31 Dec 2023 | 30 Sept 2023 | 30 Jun 2023 | 31 Mar 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |\n|----------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Capitalization ratio | 206         | 212          | 208         | 206         | 201         |\n\nCompared to year-end 2022, our Solvency II capitalization ratio increased by 5 percentage points to 206 % (2022: 201 %) since the increase in the Solvency II Capital Requirement was overcompensated by significantly higher Own Funds.\n\nThe development of the Solvency II ratio was positively supported by a solid operating Solvency II capital generation and business evolution (27 percentage points pre-tax) and a favorable impact of regulatory and model changes (4 percentage points), the latter primarily resulting from the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change and other central and local model changes.\n\nThis was partially compensated by negative effects. The main impact came from (capital) management actions ((16) percentage points), dominated by dividend accruals and share buy backs. Taxes also contributed to the decrease of the capitalization ratio ((8) percentage points). A small negative contribution ((1) percentage point) resulted from the net impact of capital market developments, whereby strain, especially from lower real estate valuations and interest rates, was largely offset by positive impacts, e.g., from stronger equity markets and lower inflation.\n\nThe following table presents the sensitivities of our Solvency II capitalization ratio under certain standard financial market scenarios.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratio sensitivities**\n\n| %                                                                                                            |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                                            | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Base capitalization ratio                                                                                    | 206  | 201  |\n| Interest rates up by 0.5%1                                                                                   | 208  | 202  |\n| Interest rates down by 0.5%1                                                                                 | 201  | 198  |\n| Equity prices up by 30%                                                                                      | 217  | 211  |\n| Equity prices down by 30%                                                                                    | 191  | 188  |\n| Combined scenario:<br>Equity prices down by 30%<br>Interest rate down by 0.5% 1<br>Credit spreads up by 0.5% | 179  | 179  |\n\n1\\_Non-parallel interest rate shifts due to extrapolation of the yield curve beyond the last liquid point in line with Solvency II rules.\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>The presented sensitivity analyses are based on defined variations of specific parameters and describe the resulting development of our Solvency II capitalization under such idealized scenarios (e.g., decrease in interest rates by 50 basis points). The observed developments will, however, typically materialize in a more complex way (e.g., interest rates are typically not decreasing in a parallel shift manner along the term structure). Therefore, sensitivities are to be interpreted in a way such that they provide valuable information on areas to which our capitalization is particularly sensitive together with an indication of the estimated magnitude. The actual observed developments in the capitalization can, however, be more or less pronounced depending on the specific realized circumstances. Our comprehensive stress testing framework is regularly analyzed in order to identify potential enhancements to support the explanatory power of stress tests conducted in light of our risk profile.\n\nThe Allianz Group is a financial conglomerate within the scope of the Financial Conglomerate Directive (FCD). The FCD does not impose a materially different capital requirement on the Allianz Group compared to Solvency II.\n\n# Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk category[2](#page-145-0)\n\nThis Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group's risk figures, reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and Group diversification effects.\n\nWe measure and steer risk based on an approved internal model which quantifies the potential adverse developments of Own Funds. The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed over different risk categories and determine the regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II.\n\nThe pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effect within each modeled risk category (i.e., market, credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification effects across risk categories. Group diversified risk figures also capture the diversification effect across all risk categories.\n\nThe Group diversified risk is broken down as follows:\n\n1\\_Own Funds and capital requirement are calculated under consideration of volatility adjustment and yield \n2\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to curve extension, as described in section \"Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment\".\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\n**Allianz Group: Allocated risk according to the risk profile (total portfolio before non-controlling interests)**\n\n| € mn                                                                            |             |        |             |       |                   |        |               |       |                  |                          |                 |          |         |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------------------|--------|---------------|-------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|--------|\n|                                                                                 | Market risk |        | Credit risk |       | Underwriting risk |        | Business risk |       | Operational risk |                          | Diversification |          | Total   |        |\n| As of 31 December                                                               | 2023        | 20221  | 2023        | 20221 | 2023              | 20221  | 2023          | 20221 | 2023             | 20221                    | 2023            | 20221    | 2023    | 20221  |\n| Property-Casualty                                                               | 6,205       | 7,064  | 2,748       | 2,695 | 14,693            | 13,344 | 722           | 593   | 1,957            | 1,872                    | (10,039)        | (9,167)  | 16,285  | 16,401 |\n| Life/Health                                                                     | 17,591      | 17,064 | 1,657       | 1,531 | 2,280             | 1,647  | 5,729         | 5,490 | 1,854            | 1,645                    | (8,858)         | (8,830)  | 20,254  | 18,548 |\n| Corporate and Other                                                             | 2,053       | 1,853  | 286         | 286   | 33                | 73     | -

This was partially compensated by risk capital relief from effects such as model and assumptions updates at Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and various other companies of the Group.\n\nThe following sections explain the evolution of our risk profile per modeled risk category. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.\n\nThe following table presents our group-wide risk figures related to market risks by business segment and source of risk.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Risk profile – market risk by business segment and source of risk (total portfolio before tax and non-controlling interests)** pre-diversified, € mn\n\n|                                           | Interest rate |       | Inflation |       | Credit spread |       | Equity |        | Real estate |       | Currency |       | Total  |        |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                         | 2023          | 20221 | 2023      | 20221 | 2023          | 20221 | 2023   | 20221  | 2023        | 20221 | 2023     | 20221 | 2023   | 20221  |\n| Property-Casualty                         | (244)         | 328   | (1,171)   | (407) | 2,429         | 2,451 | 2,908  | 2,891  | 1,741       | 1,585 | 541      | 216   | 6,205  | 7,005  |\n| Life/Health                               | (27)          | 3,434 | (237)     | (58)  | 4,262         | 4,242 | 11,278 | 7,264  | 1,719       | 1,813 | 596      | 369   | 17,591 | 17,064 |\n| Corporate and Other                       | 77            | (181) | (103)     | (7)   | 216           | 310   | 1,773  | 1,517  | 166         | 168   | (76)     | 46    | 2,053  | 1,853  |\n| Total Group                               | (194)         | 3,581 | (1,511)   | (472) | 6,908         | 7,004 | 15,959 | 11,672 | 3,626       | 3,566 | 1,061    | 631   | 25,849 | 25,982 |\n| Share of total Group pre-diversified risk |               |       |           |       |               |       |        |        |             |       |          |       | 37.8 % | 39.7 % |\n\n1\\_2022 risk profile figures adjusted based on the impact of 2023 model changes.\n\nIn 2023, the Allianz Group's total pre-diversified market risk barely changed, as a strong increase in equity risk was offset by a decrease in interest rate risk and a higher risk relief from inflation risk.\n\nThe rise in the contribution of equity risk to market risk, especially in the Life/Health business segment, primarily resulted from stronger equity markets, together with a higher exposure to alternative equity investments and diversification effects within market risk. A decrease in interest rates, together with a lower duration gap, caused a shift in the contribution of interest rate risk and inflation risk to market risk.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our interest-rate-sensitive investments excluding unit-linked business – amounting to a market value of € 360.7 bn (2022: € 347.1 bn)[1](#page-147-0) – would have gained € 32.4 bn (2022: € 32.1 bn) or lost € 27.7 bn (2022: € 27.7 bn)[2](#page-147-1) in value in the event of interest rates shifting by -100 and +100 basis points, respectively. However, these impacts would have been partially offset by policyholder participation. In addition, the Solvency II Own Funds effect is much more limited due to our active duration management, reducing the duration mismatch of the Group to 0.2 years (from 0.6 years in 2022), representing Solvency II liabilities of shorter duration than assets.\n\nThe impact of a 0.5 % increase in interest rates on the Solvency II ratio is shown in the table \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratio sensitivities\" in the section \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization\".\n\n### **Equity risk**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our investments excluding unit-linked business that are sensitive to changing equity markets – amounting to a market value of € 77.4 bn[3](#page-147-0) (2022: € 73.6 bn) – would have lost € 19.7 bn[4](#page-147-1) (2022: € 18.4 bn) in value assuming equity markets had declined by 30 %. However, this impact would have been partially offset by policyholder participation.\n\nThe following table presents our group-wide risk figures for credit risks by business segment.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Risk profile – allocated credit risk by business segment (total portfolio before tax and non-controlling interests)** pre-diversified\n\n|                                              |      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                            |      |       |       |\n| Property-Casualty                            | € mn | 2,748 | 2,695 |\n| Life/Health                                  | € mn | 1,657 | 1,531 |\n| Corporate and Other                          | € mn | 286   | 286   |\n| Total Group                                  | € mn | 4,691 | 4,513 |\n| Share of total Group pre-diversified<br>risk | %    | 6.86  | 6.89  |\n\nThroughout 2023, the Allianz credit portfolio was not affected by significant movements or events with respect to credit migration risk and default risk.\n\nUltimately, the overall credit risk for the Allianz Group increased by € 0.2 bn to € 4.7 bn (2022: € 4.5 bn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the maximum exposure to credit risk[5](#page-147-0) from debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to € 583.8 bn (2022: € 594.1 bn), the theoretical maximum exposure to credit risk from credit insurance <span id=\"page-147-2\"></span><span id=\"page-147-1\"></span><span id=\"page-147-0\"></span>amounted to € 1,185.7 bn (2022: € 1,102.0 bn), and the maximum exposure to credit risk from reinsurance amounted to € 28.1 bn (2022: € 28.8 bn).\n\n### **Credit risk – investments**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the credit risk arising from our investment portfolio accounted for 64.8 % (2022: 64.2 %) of our total Group prediversified internal credit risk[6](#page-147-2) .\n\nCredit risk in the Life/Health business segment is primarily driven by long-term assets covering long-term policyholder liabilities. Typical investments are government bonds, senior corporate bonds, covered bonds, self-originated mortgages and loans, and a modest number of derivatives. In the Property-Casualty business segment, fixed-income securities tend to be short- to mid-term, due to the nature of the business, and are not subject to policyholder participation.\n\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives is low, since derivatives usage is governed by the group-wide internal guideline for collateralization of derivatives, which stipulates master netting and collateral agreements with each counterparty and requires highquality and liquid collateral. In addition, Allianz closely monitors counterparties' credit ratings and exposure movements.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the rating distribution of our fixedincome portfolio based on issue (instrument) ratings was as follows:\n\n1\\_The stated market value includes all assets from internal model entities whose market value is sensitive to interest rate movements (excluding unit-linked business) reflecting the Solvency II framework, and therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles.\n\n2\\_The effects do not consider policyholder participation.\n\n3\\_The stated market value includes all assets from internal model entities whose market value is sensitive to equity movements (excluding unit-linked business) reflecting the Solvency II framework, and therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles.\n\n4\\_The effect does not consider policyholder participation.\n\n- 5\\_The stated investment exposure figures reflect gross carrying amounts. They are based on IFRS requirements and include investments that are not within the scope of the Solvency II framework.\n- 6\\_Additionally, 10.8 % (2022: 11.7 %) of our total Group pre-diversified internal credit risk is allocated to receivables, potential future exposure for derivatives and reinsurance, and other off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Rating distribution of Allianz Group's fixed-income portfolio1**\n\nBook values, € bn\n\n| Type of issuer    | Government bonds |       | Covered bonds |      | Corporate bonds |       | Banks |      | ABS/MBS |      | Short-term investments |      | Total |       |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------|---------------|------|-----------------|-------|-------|------|---------|------|------------------------|------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December | 2023             | 2022  | 2023          | 2022 | 2023            | 2022  | 2023  | 2022 | 2023    | 2022 | 2023                   | 2022 | 2023  | 2022  |\n| AAA               | 30.3             | 38.6  | 34.5          | 33.9 | 5.3             | 4.6   | 2.6   | 2.1  | 10.0    | 13.9 | -                      | -    | 82.7  | 93    |\n| AA                | 78.7             | 69.1  | 9.6           | 9.8  | 22.8            | 21.0  | 3.9   | 3.2  | 10.0    | 6.3  | 0.8                    | 0.9  | 125.8 | 110.4 |\n| A                 | 31.6             | 28.4  | 0.3           | 1.0  | 74.3            | 65.6  | 20.3  | 18.3 | 5.2     | 3.6  | 0.6                    | 0.8  | 132.4 | 117.7 |\n| BBB               | 37.7             | 35.0  | 0.1           | 0.3  | 99.7            | 101.5 | 6.0   | 7.5  | 2.2     | 1.9  | 0.3                    | 0.2  | 145.8 | 146.4 |\n| BB                | 7.2              | 6.7   | -             | -    | 9.1             | 11.5  | 0.4   | 0.4  | 0.2     | 0.1  | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 16.8  | 18.7  |\n| B                 | 1.6              | 2.9   | -             | -    | 3.2             | 2.5   | 0.1   | 0.1  | 0.1     | 0.1  | 0.2                    | 0.1  | 5.3   | 5.7   |\n| CCC               | 0.3              | 0.4   | -             | -    | 0.2             | 0.2   | 0.1   | -    | 0.1     | 0.1  | -                      | -    | 0.8   | 0.8   |\n| CC                | 0.2              | 0.2   | -             | -    | -               | -     | -     | -    | 0.1     | 0.1  | -                      | -    | 0.2   | 0.2   |\n| C                 | -                | -     | -             | -    | -               | -     | -     | -    | -       | -    | -                      | -    | 0.1   | 0.1   |\n| D                 | -                | -     | -             | -    | 0.1             | -     | -     | -    | -       | -    | -                      | -    | 0.2   | 0.1   |\n| Not rated         | 0.4              | 0.2   | -             | 0.1  | 8.4             | 5.8   | -     | 0.1  | 0.3     | 0.1  | 0.3                    | 0.1  | 9.4   | 6.4   |\n| Total             | 188.1            | 181.5 | 44.5          | 45.1 | 223.0           | 212.8 | 33.4  | 31.6 | 28.2    | 26.3 | 2.2                    | 2.2  | 519.4 | 499.5 |\n\n1\\_In accordance with the Group Management Report, figures stated include investments of Banking and Asset Management.

This is mainly due to changes in the interest rates environment. Materially lower EUR interest rates in particular led to a significant increase in longevity risk. In addition, local model calibration updates had an upward impact on mortality risk.\n\nContributions from the Property-Casualty and the Corporate and Other business segments are generated by the longevity risk of the internal pension schemes they contain.\n\nDue to effective product design and the diversity of our products, there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks within our Life/Health business segment.\n\nBusiness risk capital increased by 0.4 bn to € 6.5 bn (2022: € 6.1 bn). The main reason is the impact of the significantly lower EUR interest rates on the cost risk.\n\nOverall, the operational risk capital showed a slightly increased risk profile after the regular annual update of central and local parameters (increase by 0.4 bn from € 3.9 bn in 2022 to € 4.3 bn in 2023), mainly due to regulations and increasing cyber threats in some local markets.\n\nDetailed information regarding our liquidity risk exposure, liquidity, and funding – including changes in cash and cash equivalents – is provided i[n Liquidity and Funding Resources](#page-125-0) and i[n notes 7.3.1,](#page-215-0) [7.3.2](#page-215-1) and [7.5](#page-219-0) to the consolidated financial statements. As can be inferred from the section on the management of liquidity risks, while these are quantified and monitored through regular stress test reporting as well as properly managed, they are not quantified for risk capital purposes.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/1 description: The image features a large, light blue letter 'D' set against a dark blue background.

After the release of the Annual Report 2022, the Allianz Group continued with the preparation of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet and made some non-material adjustments. As such, the final version of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet for 2022 is slightly different from the preliminary version in the Annual Report 2022.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n#### **Consolidated income statement**\n\n€ mn\n\n|

These changes have also been reflected in comparative periods.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-0\"></span>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n# 1\\_ Natureof operationsand basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements present the operations of Allianz SE with its registered office in Königinstrasse 28, 80802 Munich, Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Allianz Group). Allianz SE is recorded in the Commercial Register of the municipal court in Munich under the number HRB 164232.\n\nThey have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted under European Union (E.U.) regulations in accordance with § 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). Within these consolidated financial statements, the Allianz Group has applied all standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and endorsed by the E.U. that are compulsory as of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn these consolidated financial statements, the Allianz Group has applied IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 for the first time. The related changes in significant accounting policies are described i[n note](#page-156-1) 2.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared as of and for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Allianz Group's presentation currency is the euro (€). Amounts are rounded to the nearest million (€ mn) unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Management on 22 February 2024.\n\nThe Allianz Group offers property-casualty insurance, life/health insurance, and asset management products and services in almost 70 countries.\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-1\"></span>2 \\_ Accounting policies, significant estimates, andnew accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following paragraphs describe important accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions relevant for the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions particularly influence the inclusion method as well as the accounting treatment of financial instruments and insurance contracts, goodwill, litigation provisions, pension liabilities and similar obligations, and deferred taxes. Significant estimates and assumptions are explained in the respective paragraphs.\n\n### **Reporting and presentation principles**\n\nThe Allianz Group's consolidated balance sheet is not presented using a current/non-current classification. The following balances are generally considered to be current: cash and cash equivalents, noncurrent assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale. The following balances are generally considered to be non-current: investments, deferred tax assets, intangible assets, and deferred tax liabilities.\n\nInsurance contracts are split by contracts issued (insurance) and held (reinsurance). Insurance contract portfolios in asset and liability position are further presented separately on the balance sheet. IFRS 17 is conceptually based on a prospective cash view, therefore all payables and receivables from insurance contracts as well as any deposits are part of the (re)insurance contract assets or liabilities.\n\nThe Allianz Group has made an accounting policy choice to apply the year-to-date approach for the accounting for insurance contracts. Therefore, the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements may change under IFRS 17 in subsequent interim financial statements and in the annual reporting period.\n\n### **Principles of consolidation**\n\n### **Scope of consolidation and consolidation procedures**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are generally entities where Allianz SE, directly or indirectly, owns more than half of the voting rights or similar rights with the ability to affect the returns of these entities for its own benefit.\n\nEntities where the Allianz Group does not hold a majority stake are included in the consolidated financial statements if the Allianz Group controls these entities based on either distinctive rights stipulated by shareholder agreements between the Allianz Group and the other shareholders in these companies or voting rights held by the Allianz Group which are sufficient to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.\n\nEntities where the Allianz Group holds a majority stake are not included in the consolidated financial statements if the Allianz Group does not control these entities because it has no majority representation in the governing bodies and/or it requires at least the confirmative vote of another investor to pass any decisions over relevant activities.\n\nFor certain entities, voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor of control, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and returns are directed by means of contractual arrangements, as is the case mainly for investment funds managed by Allianz Group internal asset managers. For investment funds managed by Allianz Group entities on the basis of contractual arrangements, the Allianz Group considers an exposure to variability from the aggregate economic interests (consisting of fees and direct interests in the investment funds) of more than 30% as indicative for control, unless there is evidence to the contrary, for example, if the \n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\ninvestment funds' financial and operating policies are largely predetermined or other parties engaged in the investment funds have substantive spin-off rights.\n\n### **Initial accounting for business combinations and measurement of non-controlling interests**\n\nWhere newly acquired subsidiaries are subject to business combination accounting, the provisions of IFRS 3 are applied. During the IFRS 3 measurement period, which is for a maximum of one year post the acquisition date, it may be necessary to adjust existing or recognize additional assets and liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holdersto a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation are generally measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n#### **Associates and joint arrangements**\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Allianz Group can exercise significant influence. In general, if the Allianz Group holds 20% or more of the voting power in an investee but does not control the investee, it is assumed to have significant influence.\n\nAlthough the Allianz Group's share in some entities is below 20%, the Allianz Group has significant influence over these entities if it is sufficiently represented in the governing bodies that decide on the relevant activities of these entities.\n\nFor certain third party managed investment funds in which the Allianz Group holds a stake of above 20%, the Allianz Group has no significant influence if it is not represented in the governing bodies of these investment funds or their investment activities are largely predetermined.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements have to be classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Allianz Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures in most cases.\n\nGenerally, investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, which may imply a time lag of up to three months. Income from investments in associates and joint arrangements – excluding distributions – is included in the interest − fair value through other comprehensive income, or result. Accounting policies of associates and joint arrangements are − fair value through profit or loss.\n\ngenerally adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Allianz Group.\n\nHowever, if investments in associates or joint ventures are held as the underlying items for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features, the Allianz Group elects the exemption from applying the equity method and measures these investments at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 instead. For the purposes of this election, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nFor further information, please refer t[o note 7.2.](#page-210-0) \n\n### **Foreign currency translation**\n\nForeign currency translation follows the guidance set forth in IAS 21. Income and expenses from subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the Allianz Group's presentation currency (euro) are translated to euro at the quarterly average exchange rate, unless the subsidiary's functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy, in which case the closing rate is applied in accordance with IAS 21.42.\n\nForeign currency gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reported in the valuation result in the consolidated income statement, unless they relate to the foreign exchange component of fair value changes that are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the latter case, the foreign exchange component is also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n### **Financial instruments**\n\n#### **Recognition and derecognition**\n\nFinancial assets are generally recognized and derecognized on the trade date, i.e., when the Allianz Group commits to purchase or sell securities.\n\n#### **Classification and measurement of financial assets**\n\nBased on the applicable business model and the respective contractual cash flow characteristics, the Allianz Group classifies a financial asset on initial recognition into one of the three measurement categories:\n\n- − amortized cost,\n- \n- \n\nAt the Allianz Group, financial assets that are backing insurance liabilities are generally considered to be held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (\"hold and sell\" business model).\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, investments in equity financial instruments are measured at fair value. The Allianz Group generally uses the irrevocable election at initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the instrument's fair value in other comprehensive income, provided that the instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies.\n\nMeasurement at fair value through profit or loss is only applied in exceptional cases, e.g., to reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise or if the above-mentioned preconditions for fair value through other comprehensive income measurement are not fulfilled.\n\n### **Classification and measurement of financial liabilities**\n\nIn general, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost, except for:\n\n- − Financial liabilities that are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, either because they are held for trading (including derivatives) or irrevocably designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition in accordance with IFRS 9.4.2.2.\n- − Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing involvement approach applies. These liabilities are measured in accordance with paragraphs 3.2.15 and 3.2.17 of IFRS 9.\n- − Financial guarantee contracts. Provided that the measurement rules in any of the first two points above do not apply, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognized less (where appropriate) the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.\n- − Contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies; such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Measurement at fair value**\n\nThe Allianz Group carries certain financial instruments at fair value and discloses the fair value of all financial instruments.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are measured and classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13, which categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.\n\nLevel 1 inputs of financial instruments traded in active markets are based on unadjusted quoted market prices or dealer price quotations for identical assets or liabilities on the last exchange trading day prior to or at the reporting date, if the latter is a trading day.\n\nLevel 2 applies if the market for a financial instrument is not active or when the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques based on observable input parameters.\n\nLevel 3 applies if not all input parameters that are significant to the entire measurement are observable in the market. Accordingly, the fair value is based on valuation techniques using non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques include the discounted cash flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which observable market prices exist, and other valuation models. Appropriate adjustments are made, for example, for credit risks.\n\nFor fair value measurements categorized as level 2 and level 3, the Allianz Group uses valuation techniques consistent with the three widely used valuation techniques listed in IFRS 13:\n\n- − Market approach: Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n- − Cost approach: Amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (current replacement cost).\n- − Income approach: Conversion of future amounts such as cash flows or income to a single current amount (present value technique).\n\nThere is no one-to-one connection between valuation technique and hierarchy level. Depending on whether valuation techniques are based on significant observable or unobservable inputs, financial instruments are classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nEstimates and assumptions of fair values and hierarchies are particularly significant when determining the fair value of financial instruments for which at least one significant input is not based on observable market data (classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The availability of market information is determined by the relative trading levels of identical or similar instruments in the market, with emphasis placed on information that represents actual market activity or binding quotations from brokers or dealers.\n\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments closely correlates with the use of non-market observable inputs. The Allianz Group uses a maximum of observable inputs and a minimum of non-market observable inputs when measuring fair value. Observability of input parameters is influenced by various factors such as type of the financial instrument, whether a market is established for the particular instrument, specific transaction characteristics, liquidity, and general market conditions. If the fair value cannot be measured reliably, amortized cost is used as a proxy for determining fair values.\n\nIn discharging its responsibilities in the area of the fair value measurement of illiquid investments (level 3), the Allianz Group has set up an independent Group Valuation Committee (GVC). The GVC is a cross-functional body which includes representation from the Allianz Group's accounting and reporting, risk, and, investment management functions as well as major operating entities. The GVC's objectives are the establishment and maintenance of appropriate market valuation standards as well as checks and balances in order to successfully manage the risks inherent in the internal and external fair valuation of illiquid investments. In this regard, the GVC initiates, approves, and maintains documented valuation best practices by illiquid asset cluster. Furthermore, the GVC is responsible for performing regular independent price verifications, onsite visits of operating entities, and for requiring the implementation of best practices in the area of the illiquid assets valuation. It also has prerogatives to implement measures to resolve any related findings and valuation disputes.\n\nFor further information with regards to the measurement at fair value, please refer t[o note](#page-219-0) 7.5.\n\n### **Impairments**\n\nThe Allianz Group's central risk framework under Solvency II serves as the basis for IFRS 9 impairment calculations. In regard of credit ratings which represent a central parameter of credit risk, the Allianz Group reuses the Solvency II assessment of the long-term creditworthiness of its debtors. In detail, the Solvency II rating assignment for the investment portfolio of the Allianz Group is based on external agency ratings enhanced by the Group's internal credit assessment. The internal credit assessment is used to add a point-in-time component to long-term ratings in order to capture current market information and to add forward-looking information. The Allianz Group uses hurdle ratings that indicate a significant increase in credit risk and consequently a transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 on a notch-by-notch basis. In addition, the rating hurdle is dependent on the expected maturity of the investment. A transfer to Stage 3 is triggered by a D rating or when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. The loss-given default assignment is performed based on the established methods applied for Solvency II purposes. The Allianz Group follows a cash-flow-based approach for the expected credit loss (ECL) calculation. In order to calculate the ECL, the Allianz Group uses transition matrices that take into account the probability of default (PD) as a quantitative measure of the credit quality of a financial instrument or counterparty assigned per rating notch as well as the transition probabilities quantifying the likelihood of rating changes over time.\n\n#### **Modifications of financial assets**\n\nIn some circumstances, the renegotiation or modification of the contractual cash flows of a financial asset can lead to the derecognition of the existing financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9. The Allianz Group accounting policies prescribe that a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial asset shall lead to the derecognition of the original financial asset and the recognition of a new financial asset. The determination whether the contractual terms have been modified substantially is based on a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment is required in case the qualitative assessment is not sufficient to establish that the terms of the modified financial asset are substantially different from those of the original financial asset. For the quantitative assessment, the Allianz Group applies the criteria for the extinguishment of financial liabilities analogically. Accordingly, a modification is deemed to be substantial if the net present value of the cash flows under the modified contractual terms, including any fees paid or received and discounted at the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the gross carrying amount of the financial asset prior to the modification.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Hedge accounting**\n\nThe Allianz Group has chosen as its accounting policy to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements, except for fair value hedges of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities, which continue to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.\n\nDerivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships are included in the line items investments measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Freestanding derivatives are included in the same line items.\n\nFor further information on derivatives, please refer t[o note](#page-217-0) 7.4.\n\n### **Insurance contracts**\n\n#### **Insurance and investment contracts**\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features are accounted for under the insurance accounting provisions of IFRS 17. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, please see section \"Investment contracts liabilities\".\n\nInsurance contracts are classified as direct participating contracts or contracts without direct participation features. The classification of insurance contracts forms the basis for the measurement model applied (see section \"Measurement\"). Direct participating contracts are contracts for which, at inception:\n\n- − the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- − the Allianz Group expects to pay the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n- − the Allianz Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nAs IFRS 17 does not provide any threshold for determining whether a share or proportion is substantial, this assessment requires judgment. Allianz has set up a group-wide process for assessing insurance contracts based on qualitative and quantitative criteria in order to appropriately reflect the individual contract specifics. For this assessment, the terms \"substantial share\" and \"substantial proportion\" have been applied by using 50% as rebuttable presumption.\n\n#### **Separation of components**\n\nIFRS 17 requires the separation of embedded derivatives, investment components, and performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services at inception of a contract, if certain conditions are met. The separated components need to be accounted for separately according to IFRS 9 (embedded derivatives, investment components) or IFRS 15 (non-insurance goods and services). The Allianz Group has not identified material performance obligations embedded in insurance contracts to provide non-insurance goods and services.\n\nThe Allianz Group applies IFRS 9 to determine whether there is an embedded derivative to be separated and, if so, how to account for that derivative, unless the derivative is itself a contract within the scope of IFRS 17. The majority of embedded derivatives identified in insurance contracts issued by the Allianz Group have been considered closely related or to include significant insurance risk, because there are usually strong interdependencies with other components of the contract such as contractual options, policyholder behavior, contractual surplus sharing, and mortality.\n\nIFRS 17 defines investment components as the amounts that an insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs. The Allianz Group identifies the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance. These include circumstances in which an insured event occurs or the contract matures or is terminated without an insured event occurring.\n\nAn investment component is classified as being distinct or nondistinct. The Allianz Group has not identified material distinct investment components.\n\nInvestment components that are non-distinct are not to be separated from the host insurance contract but are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. For most common life insurance products, the Allianz Group defines the cash surrender value as the non-distinct investment component. Generally, propertycasualty contracts do not have a surrender or maturity value and only have a benefit payment when a claim occurs. Therefore, a standard property-casualty contract without additional guaranteed payment features does not include any investment component. However, it is common with property-casualty contracts to have other explicit guaranteed payments, for example a low or no claim bonus or profit participation, which the Allianz Group defines as non-distinct investment components, if all respective criteria are met.\n\n### **Level of aggregation**\n\nMeasurement is not carried out at the level of individual contracts, but based on groups of contracts. To allocate individual insurance contracts to groups of contracts, the Allianz Group first defines portfolios which include contracts with similar risks that are managed together. These portfolios are subdivided into groups of contracts on the basis of profitability and annual cohorts. Both portfolios and groups of insurance contracts are always determined by the individual operating entities, considering their respective circumstances. The requirement to form annual cohorts that prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from being included in the same group (IFRS 17.22) is subject to an optional exemption in the E.U. endorsement of IFRS 17. The E.U. Commission grants E.U. users the right to choose whether or not to apply the requirement in IFRS 17.22 for certain contracts. The Allianz Group does not make use of this exemption.\n\nContracts in different currencies can fulfill the standard requirements of similar risks that are managed together. At the Allianz Group, there is one calculation currency per group of contract (GoC). In case of a GoC with contracts with different transaction currencies, a leading currency (GoC currency) is determined.\n\n#### **Measurement**\n\nIFRS 17 includes three measurement models. Insurance contracts\n\n- − with direct participation features are measured in line with the Variable Fee Approach (VFA);\n- − without direct participation features are measured under the General Measurement Model (GMM, also referred to as Building Block approach) applied; or\n- − without direct participation features can be measured under the PAA, if selected instead of GMM and eligibility criteria are fulfilled.\n\nThe Allianz Group generally applies the same accounting policies to reinsurance contracts held as to insurance contracts issued.\n\nThe Allianz Group applies the same accounting policies to the measurement of a group of reinsurance contracts held as to insurance contracts issued without direct participation features, with following adjustments:\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe estimates of the present value of future cash flows are measured using assumptions that are consistent with those used to measure the estimates of the present value of future cash flows for the underlying insurance contracts, with an adjustment for any risk of nonperformance by the reinsurer. The effect of the non-performance risk of the reinsurer is assessed at each reporting date and the effect of changes in the non-performance risk is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### **Liability for remaining coverage under the GMM/VFA**\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage (LRC) under the GMM consists of the fulfillment cash flows related to future services and the contractual service margin (CSM). The fulfillment cash flows represent the riskadjusted present value of Allianz's rights and obligations to the policyholders, comprising the building blocks of estimates of expected future cash flows, discounting, and an explicit risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk. The CSM represents the unearned profit from in-force contracts that an entity will recognize as it provides services over the coverage period. Each building block is measured separately, both on initial recognition and for subsequent measurement.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows comprise all cash flows expected to arise as the insurance contract is fulfilled. In estimating these future cash flows, the Allianz Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. Cash flows within the boundary of a contract relate directly to the fulfillment of the contract, including those for which the Allianz Group has discretion over the amount or timing. These include premiums from policyholders, payments to (or on behalf of) policyholders, insurance acquisition cash flows, and other costs incurred in fulfilling the contracts.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows arise from the activities of selling, underwriting and starting a group of contracts that are directly attributable to the portfolio of contracts to which the group belongs.\n\nDepending on the type of services provided, other costs that are incurred in fulfilling the contracts include:\n\n- − claims handling, maintenance and administration costs;\n- − recurring commissions payable on instalment premiums receivable within the contract boundary;\n- − costs that the Allianz Group will incur in providing investment services;\n- − costs that the Allianz Group will incur in performing investment activities to the extent that the Allianz Group performs them to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders by generating an investment return from which policyholders will benefit if an insured event occurs; and\n\n− income tax and other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholders under the terms of the contracts.\n\nAccording to IFRS 17, all future cash flows must be discounted. The IFRS 17 requirements for the interest curves used in the discounting are principle-based. An entity should use observable market data based on a risk-free base curve and portfolio-specific adjustments to reflect the illiquidity of insurance obligations in determining the interest curves. The Allianz Group applies a bottom-up approach in which the basic risk-free liquid yield curves are usually derived from swap rates or government yields for the specific currency and adjusted for remaining credit risk. These risk-free liquid yield curves are then adjusted to reflect illiquidity of the underlying insurance liabilities based on reference portfolios. In case of participating business, the reference portfolio reflects own assets and it is a currency-specific portfolio for non-participating business.\n\nThe table below sets out the continuously compounded rates used to discount the cash flows of insurance contracts for major currencies:\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Discount rates**\n\nin %\n\n|

Such non-financial risks include insurance risks, lapse and expense risk. IFRS 17 does not prescribe a specific approach for determining the risk adjustment. Allianz applies a Cost of Capital approach with a Cost of Capital rate of currently 6% as under Solvency II. The main differences in disclosure are that IFRS 17 requires a separate presentation of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for gross and ceded business, and a split for LRC and LIC. The main valuation differences are the reflection of diversification across Group subsidiaries in the risk adjustment of individual entities which is not allowed in the Solvency II risk margin, the exclusion of operational risk in the risk adjustment, differences in discounting, and the smoothing of risk inputs to address cross effects with financial risks not in scope of the risk adjustment.\n\nThe risk adjustment for LRC for life/health corresponds to a confidence level of 72% to 77% and is calculated based on distribution assumptions consistent to Solvency II (where applicable). For life/health, an ultimate distribution is estimated based on the Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital methodology for calculation of the risk adjustment for the LRC, projected to ultimate horizon per entity and aggregated to diversified group level. The confidence level is derived as the quantile of the Group net of reinsurance risk adjustment in the ultimate distribution of the Group.\n\nAt initial recognition, the CSM is measured to result in no income or expenses arising from the fulfillment cash flows, any cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date, and the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows and any other asset. If the fulfillment cash flows lead to a negative CSM at inception, it will be set to zero and the negative amount will be recorded immediately in the statement of profit or loss. At subsequent measurement, the CSM gets adjusted for changes in cash flows related to future services and for the interest accretion at interest rates locked-in at initial recognition of the group of contracts. A release from the CSM is recognized in profit or loss each period to reflect the services provided in that period based on \"coverage units\". IFRS 17 only provides principle-based guidance on how to determine these coverage units. Generally, the Allianz Group has defined the account value for the reflection of investment services and the sum at risk for insurance services as the default approach to determine these coverage units. If multiple services are provided in one contract, a weighting is applied, which is determined by the respective operational entity based on the respective features of the contract.\n\nThe VFA is a mandatory modification of the GMM regarding the treatment of the CSM to accommodate direct participating contracts. The assessment of whether an insurance contract meets the VFA eligibility criteria is made at the contract's inception and not revised later, except in case of a substantial modification of the contract. For contracts with direct participation features, the CSM is adjusted for changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items. No explicit interest accretion is required since the CSM is effectively remeasured when it is adjusted for changes in financial risks.\n\nAn additional CSM release is considered to avoid a delayed profit recognition by systematic real-world returns of direct participating business measured with the VFA. This adjustment reflects the expected real-world returns in relation to the risk-neutral returns applied in IFRS 17 measurement for a more appropriate allocation of the services provided in the current period, i.e., the relating income in the P&L is based on real-world assumptions. The adjustment is applied by the life/health entities in Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Expected real-world returns are updated once a year based on a fundamental analysis of long-term expectations.\n\nIf certain criteria are met, an entity may apply the so-called risk mitigation option when it uses a derivative, a non-derivative financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss, or a reinsurance contract held to mitigate financial risk. The entity may then choose to exclude from the CSM some or all of the changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risk on the amount of the entity's share of the underlying items, if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on that amount using derivatives or reinsurance contracts held; and changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items, if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on those fulfillment cash flows using derivatives, non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contracts held. The \n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nAllianz Group applies the risk mitigation option only for a limited number of portfolios in the Life/Health segment.\n\n#### **LRC under the PAA**\n\nThe Allianz Group uses the PAA for measuring contracts with a coverage period of one year or less and for groups of contracts where it is reasonably expected that the measurement of the LRC does not differ materially from the one that would be produced by applying the GMM or the VFA. The PAA eligibility per group of contract is regularly assessed. This assessment takes into account qualitative and quantitative factors which are determined at the Group level. The qualitative factors include but are not limited to the volatility of financial variables, related embedded derivatives, and the average length of the coverage period. For the quantitative test, the Allianz Group provides detailed scenarios including interest rate shocks per selected currency. Overall, the PAA is applied for the vast majority of the Allianz Group's property-casualty business (gross and ceded).\n\nIf facts and circumstances (e.g., an expected combined ratio above 100%) indicate that a group of insurance contracts measured under the PAA is onerous on initial recognition or subsequently becomes onerous, the Allianz Group increases the carrying amount of the LRC to the amounts of the fulfillment cash flows determined under the GMM with the amount of such an increase recognized in insurance service expenses and a loss component is established for the amount of the loss recognized. Subsequently, the loss component is remeasured at each reporting date as the difference between the amounts of the fulfillment cash flows determined under the GMM relating to the future service and the carrying amount of the LRC without the loss component.\n\n#### **Insurance acquisition cash flow asset**\n\nAt the Allianz Group, insurance acquisition cash flows are not expensed as incurred, but deferred over the coverage period for all measurement models. IFRS 17 foresees two levels of deferral (precoverage DAC and in-coverage DAC, DAC = deferred acquisition costs). Firstly, when insurance acquisition cash flows are incurred before the group of contracts is recognized (pre-coverage), and secondly, when the contracts are recognized following IFRS 17.38 (c) and IFRS 17.B125, where the insurance acquisition cash flows are implicitly deferred over the coverage period of the contracts to which the insurance acquisition cash flows relate. Regarding the precoverage DAC, a four-step approach applies to ensure standard compliant measurement:\n\n- 1. Identify and allocate insurance acquisition cash flows that relate to expected contract renewals and recognize those insurance acquisition cash flows as an asset (pre-coverage DAC).\n- 2. As soon as the expected contract renewals turn into insurance contracts, the pre-coverage DAC has to be transferred into incoverage DAC and included in the contractual cash flows.\n- 3. Regular assumption review of pre-coverage DAC per reporting period.\n- 4. Perform an assessment regarding the recoverability of the precoverage DAC, if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment.\n\n#### **Liability for incurred claims (LIC)**\n\nThe LIC is measured at the fulfillment cash flows relating to incurred claims. It comprises the fulfillment cash flows related to past service at the reporting date. It is calculated at a level of aggregation, which is determined at the local level based on relevant factors, e.g., line of business, region, or distribution channel. The LIC consists of the present value of future cash flows relating to incurred claims and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, applying the same principles for the estimates of future cash flows, the discount rate and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that apply to the LRC.\n\nFor the insurance contracts measured under the PAA, the Allianz Group decided to discount the future cash flows relating to incurred claims, even if those cash flows are expected to be paid or received in one year or less from the date the claims are incurred.\n\n#### **Risk adjustment for non-financial risk under PAA**\n\nThe risk adjustment for LIC for property-casualty corresponds to a confidence level in the range of 65% to 70% and is calculated based on distribution assumptions consistent to Solvency II (please refer also to risk adjustment for non-financial risk at Liability for remaining coverage under the GMM/VFA).\n\nFor property-casualty, this is based on the ultimate distribution underlying the Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital methodology for the calculation of the risk adjustment for the LIC, aggregated and diversified at Group level. The confidence level is derived as the quantile of the Group net of reinsurance risk adjustment in the ultimate distribution of the Group.\n\n#### **Reserving process**\n\nIn the following, the term reserves is meant to include the present value of future cash flows, the risk adjustment and the CSM.\n\nFor the business segments Life/Health and Property-Casualty, the central oversight process around reserve estimates includes the setting of group-wide standards and guidelines, regular site visits, as well as regular quantitative and qualitative reserve monitoring.\n\nThe oversight and monitoring of the Allianz Group's reserves culminate in quarterly meetings of the Allianz Group Reserve Committee, which is the supervising body that governs all significant reserves. It particularly monitors key developments across the Allianz Group affecting the level of the best estimate reserves.\n\nLife/Health reserves are subject to estimates and assumptions, especially on the life expectancy and health of an insured individual (mortality, longevity, and morbidity risk), on portfolio persistency (surrender and premium increase), and on the development of interest rates and investment returns (including asset-liability mismatch risk). These assumptions also have an impact on the presentation of costs arising from the origination of insurance business (acquisition cash flows). To ensure consistency in the application of actuarial methods and assumptions in the Life/Health reserving process, the Allianz Group has designed a two-stage reserving process:\n\nStage one: Life/Health reserves are calculated by qualified local staff experienced in the subsidiaries' business. The process follows group-wide standards for applying consistent and reasonable assumptions. The appropriateness of the best-estimate reserves and their compliance with group-wide standards is confirmed by the local chief actuary and local reserve committee.\n\nStage two: The Allianz Group actuarial function regularly evaluates the local reserving processes as well as reserving results, including the appropriateness and consistency of the assumptions, monitors and approves the validation of the actuarial models, and analyzes the movements of the reserves. Any adjustments to the reserves and other insurance-related reporting items are reported to and analyzed together with the Allianz Group Reserve Committee.\n\nProperty-Casualty reserves are set by leveraging the use of actuarial techniques and educated judgment. These include the best estimate of the cash flows (e.g., claims, premiums, and expenses) and the discounting of the claims. A two-stage process exists for the setting of the P&C reserves in the Allianz Group:\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nStage one: Property-Casualty reserves are calculated by local reserving actuaries at the Allianz subsidiaries. The reserves are set at a best-estimate level based on a thorough analysis of historical data, enhanced by interactions with other business functions (e.g., Underwriting, Claims and Reinsurance). Actuarial judgment is applied where necessary, especially in cases where data is unreliable, scanty, or unavailable. The judgment of Property-Casualty actuaries is based on past experience of the characteristics of each line of business, the current stage of the underwriting cycle, and the external environment in which the subsidiary operates. The reserves are proposed to a local reserve committee, where the rationale of the selections is discussed and subsequently documented. The appropriateness of the bestestimate reserves and their compliance with group-wide standards is confirmed by the local chief actuary and local reserve committee.\n\nStage two: The Allianz Group Actuarial function forms an opinion on the best-estimate level of the reserves proposed by the local entities. The Allianz Group Actuarial function challenges the operating entities' selection through their continuous interaction with local teams and quarterly attendance in the local reserve committees. The ability to form a view on the reserve best-estimate level is further enabled by regular reviews of the local reserving practices. Such reviews consist of an evaluation of the reserving process as well as of the appropriateness of models, methods, and assumptions, and an analysis of the movements of the reserves. Significant findings from these reviews are communicated in the Allianz Group Reserve Committee to initiate actions where necessary. The Allianz Group Actuarial function monitors and assesses the documentation of the validation work performed by the Allianz subsidiaries.\n\n### **Distinction between financial and non-financial risk**\n\nIn general, the Allianz Group recognizes inflation as a financial risk for claims benefits and other insurance expenses (e.g., claims handling) only when inflation is contractually linked to an index. There are insurance products where the amounts to be paid are legally or contractually linked to an inflation-index such as a consumer price index.\n\n### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise balances with banks payable on demand, balances with central banks, cash on hand, and treasury bills to the extent they are not included in investments measured at fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore, this balance sheet item contains checks and bills of exchange that are eligible for refinancing at central banks, subject to a maximum term of three months from the date of acquisition as well as reverse purchase agreements that are due within three months.\n\n### **Investments**\n\n### **Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss**\n\nInvestments measured at fair value through profit or loss comprise debt instruments that are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss based on the underlying business model or cash flow characteristics as well as financial assets that are irrevocably designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Equity instruments are included in this line item if Allianz deviates from its general approach to designate them as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or if they do not fulfill the prerequisites for such a designation.\n\n### **Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nThese investments include debt financial assets that are held within a \"hold and sell\" business model and whose contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nIn addition, investments in equity instruments that are designated to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are presented in this line item. As prescribed by IFRS 9, amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. Instead, the Allianz Group accounting policies foresee that the cumulative amounts are transferred directly within equity upon derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n#### **Investments measured at amortized cost**\n\nInvestments measured at amortized cost relate to debt financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (\"hold to collect\" business model) and whose contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\n#### **Investments in associates and joint ventures**\n\nFor details on the accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures, please see the section \"Principles of consolidation\".\n\n#### **Real estate held for investment**\n\nReal estate held for investment is initially measured at cost, including directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nFor the subsequent measurement, the Allianz Group applies the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40.33 if the property is held as an underlying item for insurance contracts with direct participation features and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nIn all other cases, the Allianz Group applies the cost model pursuant to IAS 40.56 and carries real estate held for investment at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the property's useful life, with a maximum of 50 years. Furthermore, real estate held for investment is regularly tested for impairment.\n\n#### **Fixed assets from alternative investments**\n\nExcept for biological assets, these assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments in accordance with IAS 16.\n\nThey are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life, with a maximum of 35 years, and regularly tested for impairment.\n\nBiological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with changes therein recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Financial assets for unit-linked contracts**\n\nFinancial assets for unit-linked contracts are neither held within a \"hold to collect\" nor within a \"hold and sell\" business model. Consequently, they are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n### **(Re-)Insurance contract assets**\n\nThe balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (\"insurance contracts\") or held (\"reinsurance contracts\"). For details regarding main accounting policies and significant estimates please see separate section Insurance contracts.\n\n### **Other assets**\n\nOther assets primarily consist of leased or owned real estate held for own use, software and equipment, receivables, non-current assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, and assets for deferred compensation programs.\n\nThe Allianz Group has elected the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 as its accounting policy to measure properties held for own use that are underlying items of (a group of) insurance contracts with direct participation features. For the purpose of this election, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nAll other items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured based on the cost model pursuant to IAS 16.30. When applying the cost model, depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Software is generally amortized straight-line over its expected useful life. The right-of-use assets related to leased property and equipment are generally depreciated over the lease term.\n\nThe table below summarizes estimated useful lives for real estate held for own use, software, and equipment.\n\n### **Estimated useful lives (in years)**\n\n|                              | Years   |\n|------------------------------|---------|\n| Real estate held for own use | max. 50 |\n| Software                     | 3 - 13  |\n| Equipment                    | 2 - 10  |\n\n### **Intangible assets and goodwill**\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairments.\n\nThe table below summarizes estimated useful lives and the amortization methods for each material class of intangible assets with finite useful lives.\n\n#### **Estimated useful lives (in years) and amortization methods**\n\n|                                   | Useful lives | Amortization method                                     |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Long-term distribution agreements | 10 - 20      | straight-line considering<br>contractual terms          |\n| Customer relationships            | 4 - 40       | straight-line or in relation<br>to customer churn rates |\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations is recognized in the amount of the consideration transferred plus the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree held by the direct parent in excess of the fair values assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is generally carried in the acquiree's functional currency. An evaluation of whether the goodwill is deemed recoverable takes place at least once a year.\n\nFurther explanations on the impairment test for goodwill and its significant assumptions as well as respective sensitivity analyses are given i[n note](#page-231-0) 8.9.\n\n### **Financial liabilities**\n\n#### **Financial liabilities for puttable financial instruments**\n\nThe Allianz Group records financial liabilities where non-controlling shareholders have the right to put their ownership interests back to the Allianz Group (puttable instruments). If these non-controlling shareholders still have present access to the risks and rewards associated with the underlying ownership interests, the non-controlling interests remain recognized, and profit or loss is allocated between controlling and non-controlling interests. The financial liabilities for puttable instruments are generally required to be recorded at the redemption amount. The Allianz Group recognizes valuation changes in equity where the non-controlling shareholders have present access to risks and rewards of ownership. In all other cases, valuation changes are recognized in the income statement. As an exception, for puttable instruments that are classified as equity instruments in the separate or individual financial statements of the issuer in accordance with IAS 32.16A-16B and are to be presented as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group instead of noncontrolling interests, valuation changes of these liabilities are always recognized in the income statement. This is the case for puttable instruments issued by mutual funds controlled but not wholly owned by the Allianz Group.\n\n### **Certificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities**\n\nCertificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method to amortize the premium or discount to the redemption value over the life of the liability.\n\n### **(Re-)Insurance contract liabilities**\n\nThe balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (\"insurance contracts\") or held (\"reinsurance contracts\") . For details regarding main accounting policies and significant estimates please see separate section Insurance contracts.\n\n### **Investment contract liabilities**\n\nInvestment contract liabilities include financial liabilities of investment contracts without discretionary participation features accounted for under IFRS 9. The financial liabilities for those contracts are initially recognized at fair value, or the amount of the deposit by the contract holder, net of the transaction costs, that are directly attributable to the \n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nissuance of the contract. Subsequently, the non-unit-linked investment contracts are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, while the unit-linked contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n### **Other liabilities**\n\n### **Pensions and similar obligations**\n\nPensions and similar obligations are measured at present value and presented net of plan assets by applying the provisions of IAS 19. For a reliable estimate of the obligations owed to employees, the Allianz Group makes separate estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as discount rates, inflation rates, compensation increases, pension increases, and rates of medical cost trends) for each material pension plan, considering the circumstances in the individual countries.\n\nFurther explanations and sensitivity calculations are given in [note](#page-239-0) 8.16.\n\n#### **Share-based compensation plans**\n\nThe share-based compensation plans of the Allianz Group are classified as either equity-settled or cash-settled plans. Where equitysettled plans involve equity instruments of Allianz SE, a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity is recognized. Where equity-settled plans involve equity instruments of subsidiaries of the Allianz Group, the corresponding increase is recognized in non-controlling interests. Where expected tax deductions differ, in terms of amount and timing, from the cumulative share-based payment expense recognized in profit or loss, deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences.\n\n#### **Lease liabilities**\n\nThe Allianz Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Furthermore, the Allianz Group does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for car leases. The expenses relating to the shortterm leases and leases of low-value assets including car leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor further information on these expenses, please refer to note [8.15.](#page-239-1)\n\n### **Equity**\n\nIssued capital represents the mathematical per-share value received at the issuance of shares.\n\nAdditional paid-in capital represents the premium exceeding the issued capital received at the issuance of shares.\n\nUndated subordinated bonds comprise Restricted Tier 1 notes that qualify as equity instruments pursuant to IAS 32. The instruments are presented within shareholders' equity and any related interest charges are classified as distributions from shareholders' equity, without affecting profit or loss. The notes are measured at their historical value. In addition, notes denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro at the quarterly closing exchange rate. The corresponding foreign exchange differences are recognized as foreign currency translation adjustments in equity.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent equity in subsidiaries, not attributable directly or indirectly, to Allianz SE as parent.\n\nRetained earnings comprise the net income of the current year and of prior years not yet distributed, treasury shares, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income, and any amounts directly recognized in equity according to IFRS.\n\nPlease refer to the section \"Foreign currency translation\" above for an explanation of foreign currency changes that are recognized in equity. The effective portion of gains and losses of hedging instruments designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nOther unrealized gains and losses (net) include unrealized gains and losses from investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and from derivative financial instruments that either meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting or, in the case of a fair value hedging relationship, hedge equity financial instruments that are designated to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe unrealized gains and losses from insurance contacts (net) are the cumulative amounts between the total insurance finance income or expenses and the amount included in profit or loss.\n\n### **Insurance revenue**\n\n#### **Insurance revenue under the GMM/VFA**\n\nThe Allianz Group recognizes insurance revenue as it provides services under groups of insurance contracts. For contracts measured under the GMM or VFA, the insurance revenue relating to services provided for each reporting period represents the total of the changes in the LRC that relate to services for which the Allianz Group expects to receive consideration, and comprises the following items:\n\n- − A release of the CSM, measured based on coverage units provided.\n- − Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current services.\n- − Claims and other insurance service expenses incurred in the year, generally measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the year, excluding amounts allocated to a potential loss component, repayments of investment components, insurance acquisition expenses, and amounts that relate to transactionbased taxes collected on behalf of third parties.\n- − Other amounts, including experience adjustments for premium receipts for current or past services.\n\n#### **Insurance revenue under the PAA**\n\nIn applying the PAA, insurance revenue for the period is the amount of expected premium receipts (excluding any investment component and adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, if applicable) allocated to the period. As such, for contracts measured under the PAA at the Allianz Group, the expected premium receipts are allocated to insurance revenue based on the passage of time, unless the expected pattern of incurring the insurance service expenses differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case the latter should be used.\n\n### **Insurance service expenses**\n\nThese expenses consist of claims and other insurance service expenses incurred during the period as well as the amortization of insurance acquisition cash flows, but exclude repayments of investment components. Furthermore, they include the changes in the fulfillment cash flows relating to the LIC, the losses on onerous groups of contracts and reversals of such losses and the impairment loss on the assets for the pre-coverage acquisition cash flows and the reversals of such losses. For the insurance contracts with direct participation features, it also includes an adjustment for experience adjustments of the nonfinancial underlying items.\n\nInsurance service expenses include only costs that relate directly to the fulfillment of the insurance contracts. The Allianz Group furthermore distinguishes between direct costs and overhead costs.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Reinsurance result**\n\nThe Allianz Group applies the accounting policy option outlined in IFRS 17.86 to present income and expenses from a group of reinsurance contracts held, other than insurance finance income and expenses, as a single amount.\n\n### **Interest result**\n\nInterest result is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. This line item also includes dividends from equity securities, income from investments in associates and joint ventures measured using the equity method, as well as lease income. Dividends are recognized in income when the right to receive the dividend is established.\n\nLease income from operating leases (excluding receipts for services provided such as insurance and maintenance, which are recognized as income under fee and commission income) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the receipts are not on such a basis, for example upfront payments.\n\n### **Valuation result**\n\nValuation result contains all investment income and expenses as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for income and expenses that are recognized in interest result.\n\nIn addition, commissions attributable to trading operations and related interest expenses, as well as refinancing and transaction costs are included in this line item. Foreign currency gains and losses on monetary items are also reported within valuation result.\n\nFor further details on the composition of this line item, please refer t[o note 7.1.](#page-207-1) \n\n### **Net insurance finance expenses**\n\nNet insurance finance expenses consist of finance income or expenses from insurance contracts issued and the finance income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held including the effect of time value of money and the effect of financial risk. It includes the interest accretion of the fulfillment cash flows and the CSM as well as the changes in the fulfillment cash flows due to changes in financial assumptions. For groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features, changes in the value of underlying items excluding additions and withdrawals are included in net insurance finance expenses.\n\nGenerally, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the insurance finance income or expenses other than those arising from the risk mitigation option between profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) based on a systematic allocation. Furthermore, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the change in risk adjustment for non-financial risk between a change related to non-financial risk and the effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money, which are included in net insurance finance expenses.\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the GMM, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is determined using the discount rates by which estimated future cash flows have been discounted on initial recognition, i.e., the \"locked-in\" interest rate. For Life/Health entities, the Allianz Group applies a cash flow-weighted average of interest curves through the quarters. It means averaging each quarterly interest curve for each maturity over the cash flows with maturity over the quarters. For the indirect participating insurance contracts accounted for under the GMM, for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the future cash flows is determined by using the effective yield approach or expected crediting rate approach for contracts that use a crediting rate to determine amounts due to the policyholders. An expected crediting rate approach uses an allocation that is based on the amounts credited in the period and expected to be credited in future periods based on the crediting strategy of the operating entities and under the contractual features. For the finance income or expenses arising from the CSM, a systematic allocation is determined using the \"locked-in rate\".\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features accounted for under the VFA, the Allianz Group generally holds the underlying items. The insurance finance income or expense included in profit or loss is the amount that exactly matches the income or expenses included in profit or loss for the underlying items (i.e., the current period book yield of the underlying items), resulting in the net of the separately presented items being nil.\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the PAA, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is determined using the discount rates at the date of the incurred claim, i.e., the \"locked-in\" interest rate based on accident year. For Property-Casualty entities, the Allianz approach is the simple average of interest curves through the quarters weighted by ¼ each.\n\n### **Net result from investment contracts**\n\nThe net result from investment contracts consists of changes to the investment contracts liabilities, benefits paid to the policyholders, acquisition costs, settlement costs and administrative expenses from unit-linked investment contracts and non-unit-linked investment contracts without discretionary participation features as well as investment income and expenses from unit-linked investment contracts.\n\n### **Fee and commission income**\n\nFee and commission income primarily consists of asset management fees which are recognized when the service is provided. For those fees, the service is considered to be provided periodically. Performance fees from funds are not usually recognized as income until the end of the funds' term. Before its completion, the payment claim depends on the occurrence of certain events, such as the future development of the fund, which is regularly not reliably estimable. Carried interest is generally recognized as revenue on the date of the formal declaration of distribution by the investee and only earlier if sufficient evidence exists to support that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of carried interest revenue will not occur. The transaction price for asset management services is determined by the fees contractually agreed.\n\n### **Income taxes**\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective local taxable income and local tax rules for the period. In addition, current income taxes presented for the period include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally assessed, excluding interest expenses and penalties on the underpayment of taxes. In the event that amounts included in the tax return are considered unlikely to be accepted by the tax authorities (uncertain tax positions), a provision for income taxes is recognized. The amount is based on the best possible assessment of the tax payment expected. Tax refund claims from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that they can be realized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated for temporary differences between the tax bases and the financial statement carrying amounts, including differences from consolidation, unused tax loss carry-forwards, and unused tax credits. The measurement of deferred tax assets has to take into account estimates on the availability of future taxable profits. This includes the character and amounts of taxable future profits, the periods in which those profits are expected to occur, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. \n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allianz Group recognizes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is unlikely that a corresponding amount of future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards, and tax credits can be utilized.\n\nFurther explanations are given in [note](#page-227-0) 8.4.\n\n### **First application of IFRS 9 and 17**\n\n#### **General information**\n\nThe Allianz Group has initially applied IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, including any consequential amendments to other standards, from 1 January 2023. These standards have brought significant changes to the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments.\n\nIFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4 and establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held, and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Detailed qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the effects from the initial application of IFRS 17 on the Allianz Group's financial statements have been included in note 2 of the Annual Report 2022. IFRS 17 has to be applied retrospectively unless this is impracticable. Fulfillment cash flows are determined prospectively at every reporting date, including the date of initial application. However, the contractual service margin is rolled forward over time, a split of profits between equity (\"earned profits\") and contractual service margin (\"unearned profits\") is required but is often judgmental. If a full retrospective application is impracticable, an entity can choose between a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach. This accounting policy choice for the transition approach was made on a group of contract level. The decision involved the consideration of multiple criteria, such as availability of reliable and objective information, operational complexity, or the reasonableness of the split between earned and unearned profits. For contracts measured under the variable fee approach, the Allianz Group has generally applied the modified retrospective approach using the fair value of the underlying items as the basis from which to determine the contractual service margin at transition. The most significant portion of insurance contracts measured under the fair value approach is the life business in the U.S.\n\nThe AllianzGroup applied modifications under the modified retrospective approach only to the extent that it did not have reasonable and supportable information available to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively.\n\nUnder the fair value approach, the contractual service margin of a group of contracts at transition is determined as the difference between the fair value of this group at transition determined in accordance with IFRS 13 and the corresponding IFRS 17 fulfillment cash flows measured at transition. Conceptually, the contractual service margin usually reflects the insurer's expected future profits from writing business (entry price concept). Under the fair value approach, however, the contractual service margin reflects the margin an average market participant would require taking over the contracts (exit price concept). Therefore, when determining the fair value of a group of contracts, the Allianz Group replaces entity-specific assumptions with objective assumptions that an average market participant would use for pricing the liability. For this, the AllianzGroup has determined the exit price either based on a real-world projection of the present value of future profits of the group of contracts or using an internal rate of return methodology based on distributable earnings. For most groups of contracts for which the internal rate of return methodology was applied, the AllianzGroup used an internal rate of return of 13%.\n\nBesides the determination of the contractual service margin, another crucial key topic at transition is the determination of historic interest rates. The Allianz Groupmakes use of the introduction of Solvency II, which is the general basis for the interest rates.\n\nIFRS 9, issued by the IASB in July 2014, fully replaces IAS 39 and provides a new approach on how to classify financial instruments based on their cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they are managed. Furthermore, the standard introduces a new forwardlooking impairment model for debt instruments and provides new rules for hedge accounting.\n\nGiven the strong interrelation between the measurement of direct participating insurance contracts and the underlying assets held, the AllianzGroup decided to use the option to defer the full implementation of IFRS 9 until annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 when IFRS 17 came into effect.\n\nUpon transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the Allianz Group has elected to restate the comparative information of financial assets for IFRS 9. This includes the application of the classification overlay to all financial assets derecognized in the comparative period. In connection with the classification overlay, the AllianzGroup also applies the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 to all financial assets in scope.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9**\n\n#### **Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9**\n\n| € mn

Due to differences in the nature of products, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into the business segments Property-Casualty and Life/Health. In accordance with the responsibilities of the Board of Management, each of the insurance business segments is grouped into the following reportable segments:\n\n- − German Speaking Countries and Central & Eastern Europe,\n- − Western & Southern Europe, Allianz Direct and Allianz Partners,\n- − Asia Pacific,\n- − USA (Life/Health only),\n- − Global Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East and Africa.\n\nBoth asset management as well as corporate and other activities represent separate reportable segments. In total, the Allianz Group has identified 11 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8.\n\nThe types of products and services from which the reportable segments derive revenues are described below.\n\n### **Property-Casualty**\n\nIn the business segment Property-Casualty, reportable segments offer a wide variety of insurance products to both private and corporate customers, including motor liability and own damage, accident, general liability, fire and property, legal expense, credit, and travel insurance.\n\n### **Life/Health**\n\nIn the business segment Life/Health, reportable segments offer a comprehensive range of life and health insurance products on both an individual and a group basis, including annuities, endowment and term insurance, unit-linked and investment-oriented products, as well as full private health, supplemental health, and long-term care insurance.\n\n### **Asset Management**\n\nThe reportable segment Asset Management operates as a global provider of institutional and retail asset management products and services to third-party investors. It also provides investment management services to the Allianz Group's insurance operations. The products for retail and institutional customers include equity and fixedincome funds as well as multi-assets and alternative products. The United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region represent the primary asset management markets.\n\n### **Corporate and Other**\n\nThe reportable segment Corporate and Other includes the management and support of the Allianz Group's businesses through its strategy, risk, corporate finance, treasury, financial reporting, controlling, communication, legal, human resources, technology, and other functions. Furthermore, it includes the banking activities in France, Italy, and Bulgaria, as well as digital investments.\n\nPrices for transactions between reportable segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Lease transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS, except for intra-group lease transactions which are classified as operating leases (i.e., off-balance sheet treatment by lessee) for internal and segment reporting purposes. Transactions between reportable segments are eliminated in the consolidation. Financial information is recorded based on reportable segments; cross-segmental countryspecific information is not determined.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses operating profit and shareholders' core net income to evaluate the performance of its reportable segments as well as of the Allianz Group as a whole.\n\nOperating profit highlights the portion of income before income taxes that is attributable to the ongoing core operations of the Allianz Group. The Allianz Group considers the presentation of operating profit to be useful and meaningful to investors because it enhances the understanding of the Allianz Group's underlying operating performance and the comparability of its operating performance over time.\n\nTo better understand the ongoing operations of the business, the Allianz Group generally excludes the following non-operating effects:\n\n- − realized gains/losses (net),\n- − expected credit loss allowance,\n- − income from derivatives (net),\n- − interest expenses from external debt,\n- − impairments of investments (net),\n- − valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss,\n- − specific acquisition and administrative expenses, consisting of acquisition-related expenses (from business combinations), income taxes related incidental benefits/expenses, litigation expenses, and one-time effects from significant reinsurance transactions with disposal character,\n- − amortization of intangible assets,\n- − restructuring and integration expenses, and\n- − income and expenses from the application of hyperinflation accounting.\n\nThe following exceptions apply to this general rule:\n\n- − In all reportable segments, the valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss is treated as operating profit if it relates to operating business.\n- − For life/health insurance business and property-casualty insurance products with policyholder participation, all items listed above are included in operating profit if the profit sources are shared with policyholders.\n\nShareholders' core net income presents the shareholders' portion of income before market movements and amortization of specific intangible assets from business combinations (including any related tax effects). The Allianz Group considers the presentation of shareholders' core net income to be useful and meaningful because it reduces the volatility and impact caused by non-operating items which are not attendant to the Allianz Group's sustainable performance.\n\nWhen determining shareholders' core net income, the Allianz Group generally excludes the following non-operating items (including any related tax effects):\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Non-operating market movements:\n\t- − valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and\n\t- − income from derivatives.\n- − Non-operating amortization and impairments of intangible assets from business combinations except for insurance, investment or service contracts or agreements for the distribution of such contracts.\n\nOperating profit and shareholders' core net income should be viewed as complementary to, and not as a substitute for, income before income taxes or net income as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the responsibilities of the Board of Management. The insurance activities in Iberia & Latin America have been included in the reportable segment Global Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East and Africa. Greece was moved into the reportable segment Western & Southern Europe, Allianz Direct and Allianz Partners. Previously reported information has been adjusted to reflect this change in the composition of the Allianz Group's reportable segments.\n\nAdditionally, some minor reallocations between the reportable segments have been made.\n\n#### **Business segment information – consolidated balance sheet**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                            | Property-Casualty |         | Life/Health |

commission income in Property-Casualty, statutory gross premiums in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management. The definition of total business volume is comparable to the definition of total revenues previously used within the Allianz Group. The revenues from the banking business are, however, not part of the total business volume anymore as the remaining banking activities can be considered immaterial. Moreover, in Property-Casualty and in Life/Health, smaller adjustments to premiums at some entities are applied, following some interpretation/presentation changes.\n\n2\\_Total revenues comprise insurance revenue and fee and commission income in Property-Casualty, insurance revenue in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management.\n\n3\\_Includes acquisition and administrative expenses, other income, and other expenses.\n\n4\\_Includes, if applicable, acquisition-related expenses, income taxes related incidental benefits/expenses, litigation expenses, one-time effects from significant reinsurance transactions with disposal character, and income and expenses from the application of hyperinflation accounting. Until 2022, the effects from the application of hyperinflation accounting were included in non-operating investment income (net).\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Business segment information – reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes to shareholders' core net income (loss)**\n\n€ mn\n\nFor steering purposes, the Allianz Group classifies certain income and expenses differently than required by IFRS as this is considered to provide more meaningful information. The main line items affected are the operating insurance service result, the operating net result from investment contracts, and the operating net investment income.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses operating insurance service result as a performance indicator. In contrast to the IFRS 17 definition of insurance service result, the following components not included in the IFRS insurance service result are included in the operating insurance service result:\n\n- − non-attributable acquisition, administrative, and claims expenses which before adoption of IFRS 17 were also included in the underwriting result. These expenses are included in the line acquisition and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement[1](#page-175-0) ;\n- − adjustments for experience variances at claims and expenses if the technical result is shared with the policyholders. In the consolidated income statement, these experience variances are part of the net insurance finance expenses;\n- − specific restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets which are shared with the policyholders.\n\n<span id=\"page-175-0\"></span>For a better analysis of the result from investment contracts, all related income and expenses are included in the line operating result from investment contracts. For this, fee and commission income and expenses as well as net investment income are reclassified from the respective line items in the Group income statement.\n\nFee and commission income and expenses are reclassified to operating net investment income if they are related to insurance contracts.\n\nThe following table reconciles the amounts in the consolidated Group income statement to the amounts presented in the reconciliation of operating profit (loss) to net income (loss) (OP reconciliation).\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_For the following reconciliation, non-attributable acquisition, administrative, and claims expenses and restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets are included in the line Other result.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **D \\_ Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n#### **Reconciliation for special line items between Group income statement and reconciliation of operating profit to net income**\n\n€ mn\n\n| Consolidated income statement<br>line items                        | Consolidated income<br>statement |          | Reclassification of non-<br>attributable expenses |         | Reclassification of<br>variances and<br>restructuring expenses |       | Reclassification of income<br>related to investment<br>contracts |       | Reclassification of fee<br>income related to<br>insurance contracts |         | OP reconciliation |                                                 | OP reconciliation line items                              |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--|\n|                                                                    | 2023                             | 2022     | 2023                                              | 2022    | 2023                                                           | 2022  | 2023                                                             | 2022  | 2023                                                                | 2022    | 2023              | 2022                                            |                                                           |  |\n| Insurance revenue                                                  | 91,251                           | 86,985   | -

This includes underlying items that are not solely financial in nature, e.g., an entity's profit based on local accounting principles.\n\nThe composition of underlying items for contracts with direct participation features and their fair values are disclosed in the following table:\n\n### **Fair values of underlying items**\n\n|  | € mn |  |\n|--|------|--|\n|--|------|--|\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                         |                       | 2023        | 2022    |                       |             |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------|---------|\n|                                                                                           | Property<br>Casualty1 | Life/Health | Total   | Property<br>Casualty1 | Life/Health | Total   |\n| Equities                                                                                  | 1,925                 | 108,625     | 110,551 | 2,011                 | 112,475     | 114,486 |\n| Debt securities                                                                           | 6,859                 | 283,644     | 290,502 | 7,141                 | 269,365     | 276,506 |\n| Investment funds                                                                          | 25                    | 12,466      | 12,491  | 21                    | 13,446      | 13,466  |\n| Real estate                                                                               | 139                   | 12,501      | 12,640  | 110                   | 10,815      | 10,926  |\n| Fixed assets of alternative investments                                                   | -                     | 287         | 287     | -                     | 246         | 246     |\n| Derivatives                                                                               | -                     | 214         | 214     | -                     | 417         | 417     |\n| Financial assets for unit-linked contracts                                                | -                     | 112,707     | 112,707 | -                     | 102,894     | 102,894 |\n| Other                                                                                     | 2                     | 633         | 634     | 64                    | 204         | 267     |\n| Total                                                                                     | 8,950                 | 531,075     | 540,025 | 9,347                 | 509,863     | 519,209 |\n| 1_Consists mainly of the underlying items of the accident insurance with premium refunds. |                       |             |         |                       |             |         |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.14 \\_ Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table sets out sensitivities for the Allianz Group's shareholders' equity and shareholders' net income, as well as the CSM of the Life/Health business segment, reflecting relevant scenarios for market risk and insurance risk.\n\nDeriving these sensitivities requires complex and judgmental valuations. Furthermore, market developments or insurance events reflected in the scenarios would usually trigger management reactions to balance the impact, reflecting the overall circumstances and the variety of simultaneous sensitivities including cross effects. The impact taking into account these reactions cannot be reasonably reflected in a single number.\n\nThe sensitivities are thus calculating the theoretical impact of an instantaneous shock at the end of the reporting period. They do not fully take into account all management actions and indirect effects, such as changes in the asset allocation.\n\nConsequently, the shareholders' net income sensitivity should not be interpreted as a comprehensive reflection of the respective scenarios.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\n| As of 31 December                                                            |      |                         | 2023                        |         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|\n|                                                                              |      | Shareholders'<br>equity | Shareholders'<br>net income | CSM     |\n| Allianz Group                                                                |      |                         |                             |         |\n| Base amount                                                                  | € mn | 58,477                  | 8,541                       | 52,601  |\n| Equity markets up by 30 %                                                    | %    | 4                       | 12                          | 5       |\n| Equity markets down by 30 %                                                  | %    | (4)                     | (14)                        | (5)     |\n| Interest rates up by 0.5 %                                                   | %    | (0.5) - 0               | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Interest rates down by 0.5 %                                                 | %    | 0 - 0.5                 | (0.5) - 0                   | 0 - 0.5 |\n| Credit spread on government bonds up by 0.5 %                                | %    | (1)                     | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Credit spread on non-government bonds up by 0.5 %                            | %    | (1)                     | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Property-Casualty                                                            |      |                         |                             |         |\n| 1 in 10 years natural catastrophe excess loss                                | %    | (1)                     | (7)                         |         |\n| Life/Health                                                                  |      |                         |                             |         |\n| Lapse rates up by 10 %                                                       | %    | (0.5) - 0               | (1)                         | (3)     |\n| 1_CSM sensitivities are presented for the Life/Health business segment only. |      |                         |                             |         |\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.15 \\_ Claims development\n\nThe loss triangle is a tabular representation of loss-related data (such as payments, loss reserves, ultimate losses) in two time-related dimensions. One of these is the calendar year, the other is the accident year (year of loss occurrence). Loss triangles – as the basis for measuring loss reserves – express how the loss reserves change over the course of time due to payments made and new estimates of the expected ultimate loss at the respective reporting date.\n\nThe ultimate loss of an accident year comprises all payments made for that accident year up to the reporting date, plus the loss reserves at the reporting date. Given complete information regarding all losses incurred up to the reporting date, the ultimate loss for each accident-year period would remain unchanged. In practice, however, the ultimate loss (based on estimates) is exposed to fluctuations that reflect the increase in knowledge regarding the loss cases.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the following triangles, which show only figures of the Property-Casualty business segment, follow different accounting standards on the disclosure of the payments, loss reserves, and ultimate losses.\n\nCalendar years 2021 and prior are disclosed according to IFRS 4, meaning that the overall development of loss reserves considers undiscounted non-annuities and discounted annuities.\n\nCalendar years 2022 and onward are disclosed according to IFRS 17, hence loss development by accident year is fully on an undiscounted basis (for both annuities and non-annuities). A full reconciliation of the undiscounted reserves disclosed in below triangles to the net liabilities for incurred claims (LIC) is presented in the second table below. It should be noted, that a simplified approach has been used for the calendar year 2022 loss development. While the first disclosure of calendar year 2022 followed IFRS 4 accounting, the below restated calendar year 2022 loss developments are disclosed according to IFRS 17. The simplified approach adopted relies on the split by accident year of the undiscounted IFRS 4 reserves, applied on the IFRS 17 undiscounted reserves underlying the financial year 2023 opening balance sheet.\n\nThe data is only presented on a net basis, as this is considered to be more meaningful in order to represent the retained impact on Group results. The loss triangles are not prepared on a currencyadjusted basis. This means all figures are translated from the respective local currency into the Allianz Group presentation currency (euro), consistently using the exchange rates applicable at the respective reporting date. This ensures that the reserves reconcile with reserves in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n**Loss payments for the individual accident years (per calendar year, net)** € mn\n\n|               |

As of 31 December 2023, the derivative financial instruments used for the related fair value hedges of the Allianz Group had a total negative fair value of € 128 mn.\n\nThe ineffectiveness that arises from fair value hedges amounted to € (10) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n### **Cash flow hedges**\n\nCash flow hedges were used to hedge the exposure to the variability of cash flows arising from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations as well as inflation. As of 31 December 2023, the derivative instruments utilized had a total negative fair value of € 414 mn.\n\nThe ineffectiveness that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to € (1) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023. The change in the value of the hedging instrument recognized in other comprehensive income was € 948 mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n### **Hedges of net investment in foreign operations**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group hedged part of its foreign currency net investments through the issuance of several foreign currency denominated liabilities and the use of forward contracts. The total negative fair value was € 107 mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Allianz Group enters into enforceable master netting arrangements and similar arrangements mainly for derivatives transactions. None of these enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements meet the requirements for offsetting in line with IAS 32.\n\nCredit risk associated with netting arrangements is further mitigated by collateral. For further information on collateral, please refer to [note 7.5.](#page-219-0) The maximum credit risk exposure is represented by the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nRegarding IBOR Reform, the transition to alternative benchmark rates affects two components, the risk-free rates for discounting cash flows in derivative transactions as well as reference rates of variable financial instruments and transactions.\n\nIn the meantime, the derivatives of the Allianz Group are fully migrated due to the already implemented transition of the risk-free discount rate in major currency blocks. For cash instruments, the transition of the risk-free discount rate and the transition of the reference rate Euribor used for the euro region, where the majority of the relevant financial instruments are, has already happened. The USD Libor transition happened by mid 2023. Overall the associated or expected effect of this transition is not material for the Allianz Group.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-219-0\"></span>7.5 \\_

The fair value is determined using the market and the income approach. Primary inputs for the market approach are quoted prices for identical or comparable assets in active markets, where comparability between the security and the benchmark defines the fair value level. The income approach in most cases means that a present value technique is applied where either the cash flows or the discount curve are adjusted to reflect credit risk and/or liquidity risk. Depending on the observability of these risk parameters in the market, the security is classified as level 2 or level 3.\n\nLevel 3 investments are mainly priced based on the income approach. The primary non-market observable input used in the discounted cash flow method is an option-adjusted spread taken from a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics. A significant yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a decreased fair value, while a significant yield decrease could result in an increased fair value. However, a 10% stress of the main non-market observable inputs has only immaterial impact on fair value.\n\n### **Equity investments in fair value through other comprehensive income and funds**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is mainly determined using the market approach or net asset value techniques for funds.\n\nLevel 3 mainly comprises private equity fund investments as well as alternative investments of the Allianz Group, and in most cases these are delivered as net asset values by the fund managers. These net asset values are calculated using material, non-public information about the respective private equity companies. The Allianz Group has only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers, hence a sensitivity analysis is not applicable. The fund's asset manager generally prices the underlying single portfolio companies in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines, using discounted cash flow (income approach) or multiple methods (market approach). For certain investments, the capital invested is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value. In these cases, sensitivity analyses are also not applicable.\n\n### **Derivatives**\n\nThe fair value of these derivatives is mostly determined based on the income approach, using present value techniques and the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Primary inputs for the valuation include volatilities, interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates \n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nobservable at commonly quoted intervals. In some cases, the fair value **Financial liabilities** is determined based on the market approach.\n\n### **Loans measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nFor loans measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, quoted market prices are rarely available. Level 1 mainly consists of highly liquid advances, e.g., short-term investments. The fair value for assets in level 2 and level 3 is mainly derived based on the income approach using deterministic discounted cash flow models.\n\n#### **Financial assets measured at amortized cost**\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized costs only include debt investments. For the valuation measurement please refer to the passage debt investments.\n\n#### **Associates and joint ventures**\n\nFor level 2 and level 3, fair values are mainly based on the income approach, using a discounted cash flow method or net asset values as provided by third-party vendors.\n\n### **Real estate held for investment**\n\nFair values are mostly determined using the market or the income approach. Valuation techniques applied for the market approach include market prices of comparable assets in markets that are not active. The fair values are either calculated internally and validated by external experts or derived from expert appraisals with internal controls in place to monitor these valuations.\n\n### **Financial assets for unit-linked contracts**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is determined using the market or the income approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models as well as the Black-Scholes-Merton model.\n\n### **Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss**\n\nThis position mainly includes derivative financial instruments.\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is determined using the income or the market approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models as well as the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Main observable input parameters include volatilities, yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, and credit spreads observable in the market.\n\nFor level 3, the fair value is determined using the income or the market approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models. A significant proportion of level 3 liabilities represent derivatives embedded in certain life insurance and annuity contracts. Significant non-market observable input parameters include mortality rates and surrender rates. A significant decrease (increase) in surrender rates, in mortality rates, or in the utilization of annuitization benefits could result in a higher (lower) fair value. For products with a high death benefit, surrender rates may show an opposite effect.\n\n#### **Liabilities to banks and customers**\n\nLevel 1 mainly consists of highly liquid liabilities, e.g., payables on demand. The fair value for liabilities in level 2 and level 3 is mainly derived based on the income approach, using future cash flows discounted with risk-specific interest rates. Main non-market observable inputs include credit spreads. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate of the fair value.\n\n#### **Certificated and subordinated liabilities**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is mainly determined based on the market approach, using quoted market prices, and based on the income approach, using present value techniques. For level 3, fair values are mainly derived based on the income approach, using deterministic cash flows with credit spreads as primary non-market observable inputs. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate for the fair value.\n\n#### **Unit-linked investment contracts at fair value**\n\nFinancial liabilities for unit-linked investment contracts are valued based on their corresponding financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts.\n\n#### **Non-unit-linked investment contracts at cost**\n\nThe fair value for non-unit-linked investment contracts in level 2 is mainly derived based on the income approach, using future cash flows discounted with risk-specific interest rates. Main non-market observable inputs include credit spreads. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate of the fair value.\n\nIn general, financial assets and liabilities are transferred from level 1 to level 2 when their liquidity, trade frequency, and activity are no longer indicative of an active market. The same policy applies conversely for transfers from level 2 to level 1.\n\nTransfers into/out of level 3 may occur due to a reassessment of input parameters.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group substantially retained all the risks and rewards from the ownership of transferred assets. There have not been any transfers of financial assets that were derecognized in full or partly in which Allianz continues to control the transferred assets. Transfers of financial assets mainly relate to securities lending and repurchase agreement transactions. Financial assets transferred in the context of repurchase agreement and securities lending transactions are mainly debt and equity securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income for which substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. As of 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the assets transferred for securities lending transactions amounted to € 6,329 mn (2022: € 8,008 mn).

Changes to applicable tax rates due to changes in tax law led to deferred tax income of € 0 mn (2022: € 2 mn).\n\nFor the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022, the income taxes relating to components of other comprehensive income consist of the following:\n\nThe recognized income taxes for the year ended 31 December 2023 are € 129 mn below (2022: € 443 mn above) the expected income taxes, which are determined by multiplying the respective income before income taxes with the applicable country-specific tax rates. The following table shows the reconciliation from the expected income taxes to the effectively recognized income taxes for the Allianz Group. The Allianz Group's reconciliation is a summary of the individual company-related reconciliations, which are based on the respective country-specific tax rates, taking into consideration consolidation effects with an impact on the Group result. The applicable tax rate used in the reconciliation for domestic Allianz Group companies includes corporate tax, trade tax, and the solidarity surcharge, and amounted to 31.0 % (2022: 31.0 %).\n\nThe effective tax rate is determined on the basis of the effective income tax expenses on income before income taxes.\n\n#### **Effective tax rate**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                  | 2023   | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Income before income taxes       | 11,582 | 9,664 |\n| Applied weighted income tax rate | 23.1%  | 24.5% |\n| Expected income taxes            | 2,679  | 2,365 |\n| Trade tax and similar taxes      | 243    | 204   |\n| Net tax-exempt income            | (304)  | (142) |\n| Effects of tax losses            | (104)  | 56    |\n| Other effects                    | 36     | 325   |\n| Effective income taxes           | 2,550  | 2,808 |\n| Effective tax rate               | 22.0%  | 29.1% |\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the write-down of deferred taxes on tax losses carried forward increased the tax expenses by € 33 mn (2022: € 108 mn). The reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward resulted in deferred tax income of € 122 mn (2022: € 24 mn). Due to the use of tax losses carried forward, for which deferred tax assets had previously been written off, the current income tax expenses decreased by € 0 mn (2022: € 0 mn). Deferred tax income increased by € 16 mn (2022: € 29 mn) due to the use of tax losses carried forward, for which deferred tax assets had previously been written off. The aforementioned effects are shown in the reconciliation statement as \"effects of tax losses\".\n\nThe reconciling item \"other effects\" includes expenses of € 18 mn (2022: € 29 mn) related to the write-down of deferred tax assets on temporary differences and tax credits. Deferred tax income increased by € 0 mn (2022: € 0 mn) due to the reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets on temporary differences and tax credits.\n\nThe tax rates used in the calculation of the Allianz Group's deferred taxes are the applicable national rates, which in 2023 ranged from 10.0% to 40.0%, with changes to tax rates that had already been adopted in the Czech Republic and Türkiye by 31December 2023 taken into account.\n\nDeferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recognized to the extent to which it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable profits will be available for realization. Entities which suffered a tax loss in either the current or the preceding period recognized deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities amounting to € 4,271 mn (2022: € 3,644 mn), as there was convincing other evidence that sufficient future taxable profit will be available, including recovery of assets for more than their carrying amount.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Deferred tax assets and liabilities**\n\n€ mn\n\n| € mn                                                                                            |          |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                               | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                                             |          |          |\n| Investments                                                                                     | 28,643   | 35,054   |\n| Insurance contract assets/liabilities                                                           | 20,457   | 17,984   |\n| Other assets                                                                                    | 2,025    | 2,385    |\n| Intangible assets                                                                               | 150      | 148      |\n| Tax losses carried forward                                                                      | 2,541    | 2,379    |\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                                                | 2,066    | 1,957    |\n| Other liabilities                                                                               | 4,152    | 3,248    |\n| Total deferred tax assets                                                                       | 60,034   | 63,155   |\n| Non-recognition or valuation allowance for<br>deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward | (704)    | (684)    |\n| Effect of netting                                                                               | (53,338) | (56,103) |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                                                         | 5,992    | 6,369    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                                        |          |          |\n| Investments                                                                                     | 20,266   | 21,629   |\n| Insurance contract assets/liabilities                                                           | 27,536   | 28,541   |\n| Other assets                                                                                    | 2,564    | 1,729    |\n| Intangible assets                                                                               | 1,459    | 1,463    |\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                                                | 628      | 714      |\n| Other liabilities                                                                               | 3,009    | 4,183    |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities                                                                  | 55,462   | 58,261   |\n| Effect of netting                                                                               | (53,338) | (56,103) |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities                                                                    | 2,124    | 2,158    |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                                                           | 3,868    | 4,210    |\n\nTax losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 of € 9,653 mn (2022: € 9,307 mn) resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent that there is sufficient certainty that the unused tax losses will be utilized. At the reporting date, this prerequisite was considered not fulfilled for a partial amount of € 2,839 mn (2022: € 2,752 mn). According to tax legislation as of 31 December 2023, an amount of € 2,599 mn (2022: € 2,519 mn) of these tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely, whereas an amount of € 240 mn (2022: € 233 mn) of these tax losses carried forward will expire over the next 20 years if not utilized.\n\nTax losses carried forward are scheduled according to their expiry periods as follows:\n\n#### **Tax losses carried forward**\n\n| € mn      |       |\n|-----------|-------|\n| 2023      |       |\n| 2024      | 15    |\n| 2025-2026 | 44    |\n| 2027-2028 | 746   |\n| 2029-2033 | 239   |\n| >10 years | 2,060 |\n| Unlimited | 6,550 |\n| Total     | 9,653 |\n\nAs Allianz is able to control the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences arising from investments in Allianz Group companies, deferred tax liabilities are only recognized to the extent these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. For an amount of € 4,589 mn (2022: € 4,664 mn) no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, because they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. For deductible temporary differences arising from investments in Allianz Group companies in the amount of € 355 mn (2022: € 437 mn) no deferred tax assets are recognized because it is not probable that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nUnder the Pillar Two legislation, a multinational Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its Pillar Two effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15 % minimum rate. The Allianz Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two rules. The Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Germany, the jurisdiction in which Allianz SE as the ultimate parent entity of the Allianz Group is incorporated, and is applicable starting from 1 January 2024. As of the reporting date, local Pillar Two legislations were not applicable in any of the jurisdictions in which Allianz Group entities are domiciled.\n\nTherefore, the Allianz Group has no related current tax exposure. The Allianz Group applies the exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\nThe Allianz Group is not expecting any material impacts from the OECD Pillar Two rules. Impacts are expected in jurisdictions Allianz is situated that have an overall enacted income tax rate of below 15 %, like Bulgaria, Ireland, and Liechtenstein, or in countries with a potential Pillar Two effective tax rate of below 15 %, like China, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.\n\n# <span id=\"page-228-0\"></span>8.5 \\_ Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are generally calculated by dividing net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. According to IFRS, the net income attributable to shareholders was adjusted for net financial charges related to undated subordinated bonds classified as shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Allianz Group recognized net financial charges of € (142) mn for 2023 (2022: € (119) mn).\n\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the nominator and denominator are adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive shares. These effects arise from various share-based compensation plans of the Allianz Group.\n\n#### **Earnings per share** € mn\n\n|                                                            | 2023        | 2022        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to shareholders –<br>basic         | 8,399       | 6,302       |\n| Effect of potentially dilutive shares                      | (6)         | (13)        |\n| Net income attributable to shareholders –<br>diluted       | 8,393       | 6,289       |\n| Weighted-average number of shares<br>outstanding – basic   | 396,190,104 | 404,793,132 |\n| Potentially dilutive shares                                | 125,880     | 1,467,572   |\n| Weighted-average number of shares<br>outstanding – diluted | 396,315,983 | 406,260,704 |\n| Basic earnings per share (€)                               | 21.20       | 15.57       |\n| Diluted earnings per share (€)                             | 21.18       | 15.48       |\n\nThe Allianz Group also uses core earnings per share as a measure for profitability per share.

The Allianz Group applies generally acknowledged valuation principles to determine the value in use.\n\nFor all CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for the CGU Asset Management, the Allianz Group mainly uses the discounted earnings method to derive the value in use. Generally, the basis for the determination of the discounted earnings value is the business plan (\"detailed planning period\") as well as the estimate of the sustainable returns and eternal growth rates, which can be assumed to be realistic on a long-term basis (\"terminal value\") for the operating entities included in the CGU. The discounted earnings value is calculated by discounting the future earnings using an appropriate discount rate. The business plans applied in the value in use calculations are the results of the structured management dialogues between the Board of Management of Allianz SE and the operating entities in connection with a reporting process integrated into these dialogues. Generally, the business plans comprise a planning horizon of three years and are based on the current market environment.\n\nThe terminal values are largely based on the expected profits of the final year of the detailed planning period. Where necessary, the planned profits are adjusted to reflect long-term sustainable earnings. The financing of the assumed eternal growth in the terminal values is accounted for by appropriate profit retention.\n\nIn the prior years, the value in use for all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment was mainly based on an Appraisal Value method which was derived from the Market Consistent Embedded Value and a multiple of the New Business Value (VNB) calculation.\n\nIn 2023 for all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment, the value in use is mainly derived from the IFRS net asset value (NAV), a New Business Value calculation (VNB), and a multiple of the value of New Business. For valuation purposes, the Allianz Group defines the NAV as the sum of the IFRS total equity without goodwill plus the CSM net of tax, net of reinsurance and net of the present value of non-attributable costs. This NAV reflects the in-force value including expected profits in the form of CSM. As it is based on the IFRS balance sheet, the NAV reflects a market consistent valuation in line with core steering measures applied at the Allianz Group, in particular (net) CSM and VNB.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 9 and 17 standards is a fundamental new development in the financial reporting process for insurance entities. Considering the key advantages of these standards for insurance entities, the Allianz Group changed the input basis for the value in use calculation to the IFRS balance sheet for year-end 2023. The change in the input assumption from embedded value or appraisal value to an IFRS balance sheet basis is recognized as an IAS 8 change of estimate.\n\nIn the Corporate and Other business segment, the value in use in the Digital Investments is derived by using the discounted cash flow and multiple method. Discounted cash flows are calculated based on the companies' business plan as well as an estimate of sustainable returns and eternal growth rates (terminal value). The discounted earnings value is calculated by discounting the future earnings using an appropriate discount rate. For the multiple method, transactions and revenues of comparable companies are used.\n\n### **Significant assumptions**\n\nIn determining the business plans, certain key assumptions were made in order to project future earnings.\n\nFor entities included in the CGUs of the Property-Casualty business segment, the business plans are mainly based on key assumptions including expense ratio, loss ratio, investment income, risk capital, market share, premium rate changes, and taxes. The bases for determining the values assigned to the key assumptions are current market trends and earnings projections.\n\nThe discount rate is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and appropriate eternal growth rates. The assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, segment beta, and leverage ratio used to calculate the discount rates, are generally consistent with the parameters used in the Allianz Group's planning and controlling process. The discount rates and eternal growth rates for the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment are as follows:\n\n#### **Discount rates and eternal growth rates for the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment1**\n\n%\n\n|                                                                         | 2023             |                        | 2022             |                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Discount<br>rate | Eternal<br>growth rate | Discount<br>rate | Eternal<br>growth rate |\n| Insurance German<br>Speaking Countries                                  | 8.1              | 0.5                    | 7.6              | 0.4                    |\n| Insurance Western &<br>Southern Europe                                  | 10.1             | 1.7                    | 7.9              | 0.5                    |\n| Insurance Asia<br>Pacific                                               | 9.6              | 1.5                    | 9.7              | 2.0                    |\n| Insurance Iberia &<br>Latin America                                     | 15.1             | 3.6                    | 11.1             | 2.7                    |\n| Insurance Central &<br>Eastern Europe                                   | 9.8              | 1.8                    | 9.4              | 1.5                    |\n| Global Insurance<br>Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Middle East<br>and Africa | 9.2              | 1.4                    | 9.0              | 1.0                    |\n| Specialty Lines I                                                       | 9.0              | 1.2                    | 8.3              | 0.7                    |\n| Specialty Lines II                                                      | 9.2              | 1.1                    | 8.4              | 0.5                    |\n\n1\\_The table provides an overview of weighted key parameters on the CGU level of the countryspecific discount rates and eternal growth rates used.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor entities included in the CGUs of the Life/Health business segment, the valuation is based on the NAV that reflects the in-force value including the expected profits in the form of the CSM. The CSM is part of the insurance contract liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet consisting of the present value of future cash flows, a risk adjustment, and the value of unearned profits. These unearned profits are also included from a shareholder's perspective for the company value, i.e., after tax and reinsurance.\n\nThe present value of future cash flows corresponds to the probability-weighted average of future cash flows considering the time value of money, using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. The calculation of the best estimate is based on assumptions made for demographic factors (e.g., mortality, morbidity, lapse/surrender rates), expense allowances, taxation, assumptions on market conditions for market consistent projections (e.g., reference rates, volatilities) as well as investment strategy and asset allocation of the entity. The risk adjustment reflects an additional provision to account for the uncertainty in future cash flows with respect to nonfinancial risk. For further information regarding the different components, please refer to the section \"Insurance contracts\" i[n note](#page-156-1) 2.\n\nThe VNB calculation is based on a best estimate of one year of VNB, multiplied by a factor (multiple) to capture expected future new business. The best estimate of new business is generally derived from the achieved value of new business. The new business multiple accounts for the risk and the growth associated with future new business analogous to the discount rate and the growth rate in a discounted earnings method. For all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment, a multiple of not more than ten times the VNB is applied.\n\nFor entities included in the CGU of the Asset Management business segment, key assumptions include assets under management growth, cost-income ratio, and risk capital. The key assumptions are based on the current market environment. The discount rate for the CGU Asset Management is 12.0 % (2022: 10.8 %) and the eternal growth rate is 2.6% (2022: 1.3%).\n\nFor the Digital Investments included in the Corporate and Other business segment, the bases for determining the values assigned to the key assumptions are current market trends and earnings projections. The discount rate is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and appropriate eternal growth rates. The discount rate and the eternal growth rates are calculated in line with market practice and are subject to company-specific factors, its development status, and the markets in which the company operates.\n\n### **Sensitivity analyses**\n\nSensitivity analyses were performed with regard to discount rates and key value drivers of the business plans.\n\nFor the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for the CGU Asset Management, sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the long-term sustainable combined ratios/cost-income ratios and the discount rate. For all CGUs discounted earnings, value sensitivities still exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\n\nIn the Life/Health business segment, sensitivity analyses were performed mainly based on NAV and VNB sensitivity testing on the reference rate. The analyses have shown that in case of a change in reference rates by 50 basis points, the value in use of each CGU still exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nIn the Corporate and Other business segment, a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to earnings and interest rates for the Digital Investments. The analysis has shown that in case of an increase in the interest rates by 50 basis points and under consideration of a holding period usual for the asset class, the recoverable amount approximates its carrying value.\n\n# <span id=\"page-233-1\"></span><span id=\"page-233-0\"></span>8.10 \\_ Equity\n\n### **Equity**\n\n| € mn                                                       |          |          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| As of 31 December                                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Shareholders' equity                                       |          |          |\n| Issued capital                                             | 1,170    | 1,170    |\n| Additional paid-in capital                                 | 27,732   | 27,732   |\n| Undated subordinated bonds                                 | 4,764    | 4,843    |\n| Retained earnings1                                         | 30,702   | 29,354   |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments                   | (2,883)  | (3,048)  |\n| Unrealized gains and losses from insurance contracts (net) | 34,207   | 54,854   |\n| Other unrealized gains and losses (net)2,3                 | (37,215) | (60,490) |\n| Subtotal                                                   | 58,477   | 54,415   |\n| Non-controlling interests                                  | 5,103    | 4,320    |\n| Total                                                      | 63,580   | 58,735   |\n\n1\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € (38) mn (2022: € (333) mn) related to treasury shares. 2\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € 844 mn (2022: € 1,059 mn) related to expected credit losses. 3\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € (818) mn (2022: € (1,460) mn) related to cash flow hedges.\n\nIssued capital as of 31 December 2023 amounted to € 1,170 mn, divided into 391,718,983 fully paid registered shares.

Such treasury shares are not entitled to the dividend pursuant to §71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Should there be any change in the number of shares entitled to the dividend by the date of the Annual General Meeting, the above proposal will be amended accordingly and presented for resolution on the appropriation of net earnings at the Annual General Meeting, with an unchanged dividend of € 13.80 per each share entitled to dividend.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE held 260,394 (2022: 1,724,834) treasury shares. Of these, 60,394 (2022: 54,482) were held for covering future subscriptions by employees in Germany and abroad in the context of Employee Stock Purchase Plans. 200,000 (2022: 200,000) were held as a hedge for obligations from the Allianz Equity Incentive Program.\n\nIn 2023, 818,526 (2022: 964,487) treasury shares were transferred to employees of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries in Germany and abroad. This includes 104,383 (2022: 87,172) shares granted as part of the so-called \"free share program\" (\"Gratisaktienprogramm\"). The 54,482 (2022: 38,720) treasury shares earmarked for the purposes of Employee Stock Purchase Plans from the previous year were fully consumed and, in addition, 824,435 (2022: 980,249) treasury shares were acquired from the market for this purpose. In addition, 10,240 (2022: 0) shares were acquired from the market and transferred free of charge to tied agents in Germany.\n\nAs in the previous years, no capital increase for the purpose of Employee Stock Purchase Plans was carried out in 2023. Employees of the Allianz Group purchased approximately 75% of the shares of the purchase plan at a reference price of € 224.11 (2022: € 164.61) per share and were allocated one additional share per three shares purchased, which is equivalent to a discount of approximately 25%. The shares were sold to employees at an average price of € 168.08 (2022: € 123.46).\n\nIn the year ending 31 December 2023, the total number of treasury shares of Allianz SE decreased by 1,464,440, which corresponds to a decrease by € 4 mn or by 0.37% of issued capital.\n\nThe treasury shares of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries represented € 0.8 mn (2022: € 5.0 mn) or 0.07% (2022: 0.43%) of the issued capital.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, a total dividend of € 4,541 mn (2022: € 4,383 mn), or € 11.40 (2022: € 10.80) per qualifying share, was paid to the shareholders.\n\nIn its meeting on 9 November 2022, the Board of Management of Allianz SE resolved to carry out a share buy-back program in an amount of up to € 1 bn within a period between mid-November 2022 and 31 December 2023 (Share Buy-Back Program 2022/II), based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022. In the period between 21 November 2022 and 17 March 2023, a total of 4,682,857 treasury shares with a market value of € 999,999,983.29 were acquired for an average price of € 213.54.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn its meeting on 10 May 2023, the Board of Management of Allianz SE resolved to carry out an additional share buy-back program in an amount of up to € 1.5 bn within a period between end of May 2023 and 31 December 2023 (Share Buy-Back Program 2023), based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022. In the period between 29 May 2023 and 24 November 2023, a total of 6,912,156 treasury shares with a market value of € 1,499,999,820.26 were acquired for an average price of € 217.01.\n\nAll of the treasury shares acquired within the Share Buy-Back Programs 2022/II and 2023 have been redeemed according to the simplified procedure without reduction of the share capital.\n\n#### **Non-controlling interests**\n\n| € mn                              |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                 | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Unrealized gains and losses (net) | (180) | (236  |\n| Share of earnings                 | 491   | 435   |\n| Other equity components           | 4,792 | 4,123 |\n| Total                             | 5,103 | 4,320 |\n\nThe Allianz Group's capital requirements primarily depend on the type of business that it underwrites, the industry and geographic locations in which it operates, and the allocation of the Allianz Group's investments. During the Allianz Group's annual planning and strategic dialogues with its related undertakings, internal capital requirements are determined through business plans regarding the levels and timing of capital expenditures and investments. These plans also form the basis for the Allianz Group's capital management. Resilience under stress conditions is also considered when determining the internal capital requirements of the Group. The regulators impose minimum capital requirements on the Group and its related undertakings. For further details on how Allianz Group manages its capital, please refer to the section \"Target and strategy of risk management\" of the [Risk](#page-129-0)  [and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nWith Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the Group as of 1 January 2016, the risk profile is measured and steered based on the approved Solvency II internal model<sup>1</sup>. The Allianz Group has introduced a target Solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.\n\nThe Allianz Group's Own Funds are composed of the eligible Own Funds relating to the Group of internal model and standard formula entities, the sectoral Own Funds of entities from other financial sectors, as well as the equivalent Own Funds of entities included via the deduction and aggregation (D&A) method. The eligible Own Funds relating to the Group of internal model and standard formula entities essentially consist of the MVBS excess of assets over liabilities plus qualifying subordinated liabilities, less deductions for foreseeable dividends as well as further deductions relating, for example, to transferability restrictions.\n\nBased on the information available to the Allianz Group as of the end of 31 December 2023 and with a Solvency II capitalization of 206 % (2022: 201 %)<sup>2</sup>, it is expected that the Group continues to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the minimum consolidated Group Solvency Capital Requirement. For further information on Solvency II capitalization, please refer to the section \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization\" of th[e Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group is a financial conglomerate within the scope of the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FCD). The FCD does not impose a materially different capital requirement on Allianz Group compared to Solvency II.\n\nThe Allianz Group's insurance subsidiaries (including Allianz SE) prepare individual financial statements based on local laws and regulations. The local regulations establish additional restrictions on the minimum level of capital and the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders. The respective local minimum capital requirements are based on various criteria including, but not limited to, the volume of premiums written or claims paid, amount of insurance reserves, investment risks, credit risks, and underwriting risks.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group believes that there are no outstanding regulatory capital or compliance matters that would have material adverse effects on the financial position or the results of <span id=\"page-235-1\"></span>operations of the Allianz Group. For further information on the Structured Alpha matter please refer to [note 8.13.](#page-237-0)\n\nSome insurance subsidiaries of the Allianz Group are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be remitted to Allianz SE without prior approval by the appropriate regulatory body. These restrictions require that a company may only pay dividends up to an amount in excess of certain regulatory capital levels, or based on the levels of undistributed earned surplus or current year income or a percentage thereof. The Allianz Group's Board of Management believes that these restrictions will not affect the ability of Allianz SE to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future.\n\n# <span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>8.11 \\_ Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nUnder IFRS 12, a structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting rights or similar rights held by an investor are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Allianz Group engages in some business activities that involve the use of entities that meet the above-mentioned definition of structured entities. Primarily, the Allianz Group is involved with such entities due to its investment activities associated with its insurance business and due to its asset management activities. Furthermore, structured entities are used by the Allianz Group to source out certain risks to investors as part of its reinsurance business. Generally, the classification of an entity as a structured entity may require significant judgment.\n\nIn the following sections, the business activities involving unconsolidated structured entities are described.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems the model to be \"partial\" because not all of the related entities are using the internal model. Some of the smaller entities report under the standard formula and others under the deduction and aggregation approach. Without loss of\n\ngenerality, the term internal model might be used in the following chapters, e.g., in case descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on processes with respect to the internal model components.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions, the Solvency II capitalization ratio amounts to 229 % as of 31.12.2023 (2022: 230 %).\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Investments in asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by securitization vehicles**\n\nThe Allianz Group acts as an investor in ABS- or MBS-issuing securitization vehicles that purchase pools of assets, including commercial mortgage loans (CMBS), auto loans, credit card receivables, and others. These securitization vehicles refinance the purchase of assets by issuing tranches of ABS or MBS whose repayment is linked to the performance of the assets held by the vehicles.\n\nSecuritization vehicles invested in by the Allianz Group have generally been set up by third parties. Furthermore, the Allianz Group has neither transferred any assets to these vehicles nor has it provided any further credit enhancements to them.\n\nIncome derived from investments in securitization vehicles mainly includes interest income generated from ABS and MBS, as well as realized gains and losses from disposals of these securities.\n\nWithin the asset management business, the Allianz Group acts as asset manager for some securitization vehicles. The assets under management of these vehicles amounted to € 3,884 mn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 3,051 mn). Some of the affected vehicles have been set up by the Allianz Group, others by third parties. In this context, the role of the Allianz Group is limited to asset management.\n\nIncome derived from the management of securitization vehicles comprises asset management fees.\n\n### **Investments in investment funds**\n\nConsidering the broad variety of investment funds across different jurisdictions, the classification of investment funds as structured entities based on the definition in IFRS 12 is judgmental. As a general rule, the management of relevant activities of an investment fund is delegated to the fund manager via asset management agreements. In contrast, influence from investors on the relevant activities of investment funds is usually either precluded by legal or regulatory provisions or not deemed substantial.\n\nInvestment funds are generally subject to stringent regulatory requirements from financial authorities in all jurisdictions across the world. Comprehensive regulation of funds protects fund investors and also helps to limit investment risk. These mechanisms result in a legal set-up of funds that the Allianz Group has to accept as investor and which may lead to a classification as structured entities under IFRS 12.\n\nWith regard to investment activities, income mainly includes distributions from the funds as well as realized gains and losses from disposals.\n\n### **Asset management activities**\n\nWithin the asset management business, investment funds are established and managed to accommodate retail and institutional clients' requirements to hold investments in specific asset classes, market segments, or regions. Within the insurance business, policyholder money is partly invested in investment funds managed by Allianz's group-internal asset managers. Investment funds managed by the Allianz Group may include mutual funds, special funds, and other funds.\n\nIncome derived from the management of investment funds mainly includes asset management fees and performance-based fees.\n\nInvestment funds launched by group-internal asset managers can be considered to be sponsored by the Allianz Group. As a sponsor, the Allianz Group is involved in the legal set-up and marketing of internally managed investment funds through its asset management subsidiaries. This may include providing seed capital to the funds and providing administrative services to ensure the investment funds' operation. Investment funds managed by group-internal asset managers can be reasonably associated with the Allianz Group. The use of the Allianz name for investment funds is another indicator that the Allianz Group has acted as a sponsor for the respective funds. Information on the management fees generated in the asset management business is disclosed i[n note](#page-226-0) 8.1.\n\n**Nature of risks associated with unconsolidated structured entities**\n\n### **Interests in asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by securitization vehicles**\n\n#### **Carrying amounts of ABS and MBS investments by type of category** € mn\n\n| As of 31 December | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| CMBS              | 8,383  | 9,783  |\n| CMO/CDO           | 7,652  | 6,897  |\n| U.S. agency       | 2,818  | 2,730  |\n| Auto              | 737    | 558    |\n| Other             | 8,514  | 6,435  |\n| Total1,2          | 28,104 | 26,402 |\n\n1\\_Comprises mainly investments.\n\n2\\_Thereof rated AAA or AA € 19,947 mn (2022: € 20,229 mn).\n\nThe carrying amounts in the tables listed above correspond to an aggregated amortized cost amount of € 29,791 mn (2022: € 28,902 mn).

Furthermore, the Allianz Group has entered commitments to invest in private equity funds and further financial instruments of up to € 35,346 mn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 36,605 mn).\n\nThe carrying amounts in the tables listed above correspond to an aggregated amortized cost amount of € 63,231 mn (2022: € 56,538 mn). In a very extreme scenario, this amortized cost amount represents the maximum exposure to loss for the Allianz Group from these investments. In the reporting period, the Allianz Group has not provided any financial or other support to these entities, nor does it have the intention to provide such support in the future.\n\nBesides the investments in investment funds described above, the Allianz Group also holds investment funds to fund unit-linked insurance contracts. However, these holdings are held on behalf and for the benefit of unit-linked policyholders only. For that reason, these holdings are not included in the table above. As of 31 December 2023, the volume of unit-linked assets amounted to € 152,872 mn (2022: € 141,034 mn). Any exposure to loss on these investments is solely borne by the unit-linked policyholder.\n\n## 8.12 \\_ Related party transactions\n\nDetailed information on the remuneration of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board according to the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code are disclosed in the [Remuneration](#page-25-0)  [Report.](#page-25-0) The following descriptions are made in accordance with IAS 24.17 and IAS 24.18.\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Management consists of a fixed remuneration component and a performance-based remuneration component:\n\n- − The fixed remuneration component comprises the base salary, perquisites (e.g., contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and a company car) and pension contributions. The pension contributions of the company to the current defined contribution pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\" are generally 15% of the target remuneration of the Board members.\n- − The performance-based variable remuneration includesthe shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. The long-term, share-based compensation (Long-Term Incentive – LTI) is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the longterm development of key performance indicators is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration of the Board of Management:\n\n**Remuneration of the Board of Management (expenses of the year)** € mn\n\n| As of 31 December             | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| Short-term employee benefits1 | 21   | 22   |\n| Post-employment benefits      | 5    | 6    |\n| Share-based payment           | 28   | 17   |\n| Total                         | 54   | 46   |\n\n1\\_Includes base salary, perquisites as well as short-term annual bonus.\n\nExisting provisions are mainly related to post-employment benefits and share-based payment. As of 31 December 2023, reserves for pensions and similar benefits for active members of the Board of Management amounted to € 35 mn (2022: € 35 mn). Provisions for share-based payment amounted to € 47 mn (2022: € 40 mn).\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE consists of a fixed remuneration, committee-related remuneration, as well as attendance fees and reimbursement of expenses. These are considered as short-term employee benefits. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board was € 4 mn (2022: € 3 mn).\n\nTransactions between Allianz SE and its subsidiaries that are to be deemed related parties have been eliminated in the consolidation and are not disclosed in the notes.\n\nBusiness relations with joint ventures and associates are set on an arm's length basis and are mainly related to loans (please refer to note [7.2.4\\)](#page-213-0) and reinsurance agreements.\n\nFor information on the formation of the partnership with Sanlam Ltd., please se[e note](#page-169-0) 3.\n\n# <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>8.13 \\_ Litigation, guarantees, commitments, and other contingencies\n\nAllianz Group companies are involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and a number of foreign jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business, including, amongst others, their activities as insurance, banking and asset management companies, employers, investors and taxpayers. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in adverse publicity and damage to the Allianz Group's reputation. As a result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on the Allianz Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. Apart from the proceedings discussed below, Allianz SE is not aware of any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its and/or the Allianz Group's financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz Group companies are involved include in particular the following:\n\nIn January 2023 a putative class action complaint has been filed against Allianz SE and, in its amended version, against AllianzGI U.S. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges violation of Federal U.S. Securities Laws by making false or misleading statements in public disclosures such as the annual reports of Allianz in the period between March 2018 and May 2022 regarding the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha matter and internal controls. Allianz SE considers the action to be unfounded.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Guarantees**\n\n| € mn                     |       |      |\n|--------------------------|-------|------|\n| As of 31 December        | 2023  | 2022 |\n| Financial guarantees     | 803   | 54   |\n| Non-financial guarantees | 790   | 929  |\n| Total                    | 1,593 | 983  |\n\n### **Commitments**\n\n€ mn\n\n| € mn                                                                                     |        |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Commitments to acquire interests in joint ventures,<br>associates and equity investments | 35,346 | 36,605 |\n| Commitments to purchase debt investments                                                 | 7,383  | 8,072  |\n| Other commitments                                                                        | 3,465  | 4,164  |\n| Total                                                                                    | 46,194 | 48,843 |\n\n**Reconciliation of gross carrying amount for financial guarantees and commitments to purchase debt investments as of 31 December 2023 and 2022**\n\n|                                                                   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| As of 1 January                                                   | 8,126   | 6,283   |\n| Additions                                                         | 3,104   | 2,713   |\n| Changes in the consolidated subsidiaries of the<br>Allianz Group  | -       | -       |\n| Changes in models and risk parameters and due to<br>modifications | -       | -       |\n| Matured or sold                                                   | (942)   | (1,590) |\n| Reclassifications between stages                                  | -       | (34)    |\n| Write-offs                                                        | -       | -       |\n| Amortization                                                      | -       | -       |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments                          | (91)    | 51      |\n| Other changes                                                     | (2,011) | 703     |\n| As of 31 December                                                 | 8,186   | 8,126   |\n\nAny material contingent liabilities resulting from litigation matters are captured in the litigation section above.\n\nPursuant to §§221 et seq. of the German Insurance Supervision Act (\"Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – VAG\"), mandatory insurance guarantee schemes (\"Sicherungsfonds\") for life insurers as well as for health insurers are implemented in Germany, which are financed through their member undertakings.\n\nThe insurance guarantee scheme for life insurers levies annual contributions and, under certain circumstances, special contributions. As of 31 December 2023, the future liabilities of Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries of Allianz SE to the insurance guarantee scheme pursuant to the SichLVFinV amount to annual contributions of € 32.1 mn (2022: € 4.8 mn) and potential special contributions of, in principle, € 357 mn (2022: € 303 mn) per year. In addition, Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries have assumed a contractual obligation to provide, if required, further funds to Protektor Lebensversicherungs-AG (\"Protektor\"), a life insurance company that has assumed the task of the mandatory insurance guarantee scheme for life insurers. Such obligation is, in principle, based on a maximum of 1% of the sum of the net underwriting reserves with deduction of payments already provided to the insurance guarantee scheme. As of 31 December 2023, and under inclusion of the contributions to the mandatory insurance scheme mentioned above for a limited period of time, and assuming that no other life insurer is exempted from payments, the aggregate outstanding commitment of Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries to the insurance guarantee scheme and to Protektor is € 3,243 mn (2022: € 2,734 mn).\n\n# 8.14 \\_ Hyperinflationary economies\n\nSubsidiaries of the Allianz Group that operate in Türkiye and Argentina have to apply hyperinflation accounting in accordance with IAS 29.\n\nIn applying IAS 29, the Allianz Group has adopted the accounting policy to present the combined effect of the restatement in accordance with IAS 29 and the translation according to IAS 21 as a net change for the year in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe identities and levels of the price indices applied by the operating entities concerned are as follows:\n\n#### **Hyperinflationary economies**\n\n|           | Index                                                                                   | As of<br>31 December<br>2023 | As of<br>31 December<br>2022 |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Türkiye   | Consumer Price Index<br>published by the Turkish<br>Statistical Institute<br>(TURKSTAT) | 1,859.38                     | 1,128.45                     |\n| Argentina | Consumer Price Index<br>published by the Argentinian<br>Statistical Institute           | 3,533.19                     | 1,134.59                     |\n\nOverall, for the year ended 31 December 2023, the application of hyperinflation accounting according to IAS 29 had a negative impact on net income of € (264) mn (2022: € (282) mn).

Investment property comprises a number of commercial properties that are leased to third parties.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the maturities for the future minimum lease payments of operating leases were as follows:\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>\n\n| As of 31 December           | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|\n| One year and less           | 1,110 | 916   |\n| Between 1 and up to 2 years | 948   | 778   |\n| Between 2 and up to 3 years | 855   | 702   |\n| Between 3 and up to 4 years | 765   | 599   |\n| Between 4 and up to 5 years | 502   | 496   |\n| More than 5 years           | 1,730 | 1,690 |\n| Total                       | 5,909 | 5,181 |\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 8.16 \\_ Pensions and similar obligations\n\nRetirement benefits in the Allianz Group, which are granted to employees and in Germany also to agents, are either in the form of defined benefit or defined contribution plans. For defined benefit plans, the beneficiary is granted a defined benefit by the employer or via an external entity. In contrast to defined contribution arrangements, the future cost to the employer of a defined benefit plan is not known with certainty in advance.\n\nThe Allianz Group provides competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability benefits using risk-appropriate vehicles. The plans may vary from country to country due to the different legal, fiscal, and economic environments.\n\nRisks typically associated with defined benefit plans are biometric risks such as longevity, disability, and death, as well as economic risks such as interest rates, inflation, and compensation increases. New plans are primarily based on contributions and may include, in some cases, guarantees such as the preservation of contributions or minimum interest rates.\n\nEach of the pension plans in Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland contributes more than 5% to the Allianz Group's defined benefit obligation or its plan assets. As the Allianz Retirement and Death Benefits Fund in the U.K. closed from 1 July 2015 to future accrual and the plans in Switzerland are nearly negligible from a risk perspective, except a minor liquidity risk due to the \"Freizügigkeitsleistung\", only the defined benefit plans in Germany are described in more detail regarding key risks and regulatory environment.\n\nMost active German employees participate in contributionbased plans using different vehicles to cover the base salary both below and above the German social security ceiling (GSSC). Since 1 January 2015, the Allianz Group contributes for new entrants and for the majority of contribution-based pension plan beneficiaries to the low-risk pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\", where only contributions are preserved. For salaries above the GSSC, the Allianz Group decides each year whether and to which extent a budget for the contribution-based pension plans is provided. Independently of this decision, an additional risk premium is paid to cover death and disability. Generally the accruals of the contributionbased pension plans are wholly funded, whereas the grandfathered plans are funded to a minor extent. On retirement, the accumulated capital is paid as a lump sum or converted to a lifetime annuity.\n\nEmployees who joined Allianz before 1 January 2015 participate in the Allianz Versorgungskasse VVaG (AVK), financed through employee contributions, and the Allianz Pensionsverein e.V. (APV), which is financed by the employer. Both pension funds provide pension benefits for the base salary up to the GSSC, are wholly funded along local regulatory requirements, and were closed to new entrants, effective 31 December 2014. AVK and APV are legally separate administered pension funds with trustee boards being responsible for the investment of the assets and the risk management. AVK is subject to German insurance regulation. The assets of the contribution-based pension plans are allocated to a trust (Methusalem Trust e.V.) and managed by a board of trustees. For the AVK, the annual minimum interest rate guaranteed is 1.75% – 3.50%, depending on the date of joining the Allianz Group, and for the closed part of the contributionbased pension plan it is 2.75%.\n\nThere is also a partly funded defined benefit pension plan for agents (\"VertreterVersorgungsWerk, VVW\"), which has been closed for new entrants since 31 December 2011. A part of the pension plan serves as a replacement for the compensatory claim of agents according to German Commercial Code (§89b). VVW is similar to a final salary benefit plan.\n\nPension increases apart from AVK and APV are guaranteed at 1% p.a. at a minimum. Depending on legal requirements, some pension increases are linked to inflation. In AVK, the complete surplus share of the retirees is used to increase their pension.\n\nThe period in which a retirement benefit can be drawn is usually between the ages of 60 and 67. Disability benefits are granted until retirement pension is paid. In the case of death under the previous plans, surviving dependents normally receive 60% (widow/widower) and 20% (per child) of the original employee's pension, in total not to exceed 100%. Under the \"My Allianz Pension\" plan, the surviving dependents receive the capital accrued.\n\nAdditionally, the Allianz Group offers a deferred compensation program, \"Pensionszusage durch Entgeltumwandlung (PZE)\", for active employees. Within some boundaries they convert at their discretion parts of their gross income and, in exchange, receive a pension commitment of equal value.

Although this represents the best estimate as of today, considering a further increase in life expectancy could be reasonable. The weighted average life expectancy of a currently 65-year-old female plan participant is about 89.3(2022: 89.6) years, and of a currently 65-year-\n\nold male plan participant about 87.4(2022: 86.9) years. An increase in life expectancy by one year would lead to an increase of the defined benefit obligation by € 519 mn (2022: € 493 mn).\n\nThe weighted average values of the assumptions for the Allianz Group's defined benefit plans used to determine the defined benefit obligation and the recognized expenses are as follows:\n\n**Assumptions for defined benefit plans**\n\n| %                                          |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| As of 31 December                          | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Discount rate                              | 3.2  | 3.6  |\n| This includes the following country rates: |      |      |\n| Germany                                    |      |      |\n| long duration                              | 3.2  | 3.7  |\n| short duration                             | 3.2  | 3.7  |\n| United Kingdom                             | 4.5  | 4.8  |\n| Switzerland                                | 1.5  | 1.8  |\n| Rate of compensation increase              | 1.9  | 1.8  |\n| Rate of pension increase                   | 2.2  | 2.2  |\n| Rate of medical cost trend                 | 5.6  | 9.4  |\n\nThe recognized expenses are recorded based on the assumptions of\n\nThe discount rate assumption is the most significant risk for the defined benefit obligation. It reflects market yields at the balance sheet date of high-quality fixed-income investments corresponding to the currency and duration of the liabilities. In the eurozone, the decision for the discount rate is based on AA-rated financial and corporate bonds, and a standardized cash flow profile for a mixed population.\n\nThe range for the sensitivity calculations was derived by analyzing the average volatility over a five-year period.\n\nAn increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points would lead to a decrease of € 1.0 bn (2022: € 1.0 bn) in the defined benefit obligation, whereas a decrease in the discount rate by 50 basis points would lead to an increase of € 1.2 bn (2022: 1.1 bn).\n\nAn increase of pre-retirement benefit assumptions (e.g., a salary increase) of 25 basis points would have an effect of € 42 mn (2022: € 39 mn) on the defined benefit obligation. However, the increase of post-retirement assumptions (e.g., inflation-linked increases of pension payments) of 25 basis points would increase the defined benefit obligation by € 359 mn (2022: € 343 mn).\n\n### **Plan assets/Asset liability management (ALM)**\n\nBased on the estimated future cash flows of € 1,058 mn for 2024, € 989 mn for 2025, € 1,035 mn for 2026, € 1,087 mn for 2027, € 1,109 mn for 2028, and € 5,585 mn for 2029 – 2033, the weighted duration of the defined benefit obligation is 13.9 (2022: 14.0) years. Based on the liability profiles of the defined benefit obligation and on the regulatory funding requirements, the Allianz Group usesstochastic asset liability models to optimize the asset allocation from a risk-return perspective.\n\nDue to a well-diversified portfolio of approximately 132,000 (2022: 129,000) plan participants, no reasonable uncertainty is expected with regard to future cash flows that could affect the liquidity of the Allianz Group.

Plan assets do not include any real estate used by the Allianz Group, and include only € 4.7 mn (2022: € 4.0 mn) of its own transferable financial instruments.\n\nIn addition to the plan assets of € 14.4 bn (2022: € 13.7 bn), the Allianz Group has dedicated assets at Group level amounting to € 8.7 bn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 7.1 bn), which are likewise managed according to Allianz ALM standards.\n\n### **Contributions**\n\nFor the year ending 31 December 2024, the Allianz Group expects to contribute € 235 mn to its defined benefit plans (2022: € 229 mn for the year ending 31 December 2023), and to pay € 486 mn directly to participants in its defined benefit plans (2022: € 431 mn for the year ending 31 December 2023).\n\nthe corresponding previous year.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nDefined contribution plans are funded through independent pension funds or similar organizations. Contributions fixed in advance (e.g., based on salary) are paid to these institutions and the beneficiary's right to benefits exists against the pension fund. The employer has no obligation beyond payment of the contributions.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recognized expenses for defined contribution plans of € 319 mn (2022: € 345 mn). Additionally, the Allianz Group paid contributions for state pension schemes of € 402 mn (2022: € 342 mn).\n\n# 8.17 \\_ Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe AEI plan is granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and is part of the variable compensation component for the plan beneficiaries.\n\nThe RSU granted to a plan participant obligatesthe Allianz Group to pay in cash the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share on the vesting day, or to convert one RSU into one Allianz SE share. The Allianz Group can choose the settlement method for each unit. The payout is capped at a 200 % share price growth above the grant price.\n\nThe RSUs are subject to a contractual vesting period of four years and the payout per RSU is fixed on the last day of the contractual vesting period, which ends on the tenth trading day following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective AEI plan expires.\n\nIn addition, upon the death of a plan participant, a change of control or notice for operational reasons, the RSUs vest immediately and are exercised by the company.\n\nThe RSUs are virtual stocks without dividend payments and with a capped payout. The fair value is calculated by subtracting the net present value of expected future dividend payments until maturity, as well as the fair value of the cap from the prevailing share price as of the valuation date. The cap is valued as a European short call option, using prevailing market data as of the valuation date.\n\nThe following table showsthe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the RSUs at grant date:\n\n#### **Assumptions of AEI plans**\n\n| Year of issue1                                    |   | 20242  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share price                                       | € | 247.32 | 219.06 | 200.99 |\n| Average dividend yield of Allianz SE share        | % | 5.1    | 5.3    | 5.8    |\n| Average interest rate                             | % | 3.0    | 3.3    | (0.3)  |\n| Expected volatility of the Allianz SE share price | % | 18.0   | 20.2   | 21.2   |\n\n1\\_The AEI RSUs are granted as part of the remuneration of the respective prior year. 2\\_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.\n\nThe RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans because the Allianz Group intends to settle in cash. Therefore, the Allianz Group accrues the fair value of the RSUs as compensation expenses over the IFRS vesting period. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recognized compensation expenses related to the AEI plans of € 219 mn (2022: € 113 mn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recorded provisions of € 415 mn (2022: € 326 mn) for these RSUs in other liabilities.\n\nUnder the LTI plan, awards are granted in the form of index-linked restricted stock units (RSUs) which are part of the remuneration policy[1](#page-243-0) for the members of Allianz SE's Board of Management.\n\nRSUs granted to the members of the Board of Management obligate Allianz SE to pay per RSU a cash amount equal to the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share on the last day of the contractual vesting period, multiplied by a performance factor which reflects the total performance of the Allianz stock, relative to the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index during the fouryear contractual vesting period.\n\nThe contractual vesting period ends on the tenth trading day following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective RSU award expires. The payout per RSU is subject to a 200% share price cap relative to the share price at the grant date and a 200% cap applied to the performance factor. In addition, there is a cap <span id=\"page-243-0\"></span>applicable to the total compensation including the LTI payout and various other compensation components.\n\nThe fair value of the index-linked RSUs is calculated as the present value of the expected future payout, taking into account the link between share price performance and relative performance compared to the index, as well as the relevant caps and thresholds as defined in the payout formula. The expected future payout is determined on the basis of observable market data as of the valuation date and market standard simulation techniques.\n\nThe following table shows the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the index-linked RSUs at grant date:\n\n#### **Assumptions of LTI plans**\n\n| Year of issue1                                               | 20242    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Share price                                                  | € 247.32 | 219.06 | 200.99 |\n| Average dividend yield of Allianz SE share                   | % 5.1    | 5.3    | 5.8    |\n| Average interest rate                                        | % 2.3    | 3.2    | 0.0    |\n| Expected volatility of the Allianz SE share price            | % 19.3   | 20.3   | 21.9   |\n| Expected volatility of the index                             | % 17.1   | 16.4   | 18.4   |\n| Expected correlation of the Allianz SE share price and index | % 88.4   | 86.8   | 92.3   |\n\n1\\_The LTI RSUs are granted as part of the remuneration of the respective prior year. 2\\_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.\n\nThe index-linked RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans because the Allianz Group settles in cash.

Participants in the plan are granted options to acquire an own class of equity instruments (M-units), which vest in one-third increments on approximately the third, fourth, and fifth anniversary of the option grant date. Upon vesting, options will automatically be exercised in a cashless transaction, provided they are in the money. Participants may elect to defer the receipt of M-units through the Munit Deferral Plan until termination of their service at the latest. With the M-unit Plan, participants can directly participate in PIMCO's performance. Class M-units are non-voting common equity with limited information rights. They bear quarterly distributions equal to a pro-rata share of PIMCO's net distributable income. Deferred M-units have a right to receive a quarterly cash compensation equal to and in lieu of quarterly dividend payments.\n\nA maximum of 250,000 M-units are authorized for issuance under the M-unit Plan.\n\nAccording to an amendment of the PIMCO LLC Class M-unit Plan, no new M-unit options will be issued after 14 March 2020. Already issued and outstanding M-unit options remain valid and continue as is.\n\nThe fair value of the underlying M-unit options was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Volatility was derived in part by considering the average historical and implied volatility of a selected group of peers. The expected life of one granted option was calculated based on treating the three vesting tranches (one third in years 3, 4, and 5) as three separate awards.\n\nThe number and weighted-average exercise price of the M-unit options outstanding and exercisable are as follows:\n\n### **Reconciliation of outstanding M-unit options**\n\n|                                  | 2023                 |                                          | 2022                 |                                          |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of<br>options | Weighted<br>average<br>exercise<br>price | Number of<br>options | Weighted<br>average<br>exercise<br>price |\n|                                  |                      | €                                        |                      | €                                        |\n| Outstanding as of 1<br>January   | 59,004               | 14,364.26                                | 102,231              | 13,480.70                                |\n| Granted                          | -                    | -                                        | -                    | -                                        |\n| Exercised                        | (31,613)             | 14,299.41                                | (38,379)             | 13,080.42                                |\n| Forfeited                        | (2,666)              | 15,112.58                                | (4,848)              | 15,165.61                                |\n| Outstanding as of 31<br>December | 24,725               | 14,979.42                                | 59,004               | 14,364.26                                |\n| Exercisable as of 31<br>December | -                    | -                                        | -                    | -                                        |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options outstanding was € 121 mn (2022: € 173 mn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the M-unit options outstanding have an exercise price between € 13,140.81 and € 16,119.13, and a weightedaverage remaining contractual life of 0.87 years.\n\nThe share options settled by delivery of PIMCO LLC shares are accounted for as equity-settled plans.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Allianz SE including the non-financial group statement to comply with §§ [Articles] 315b to 315c HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] included in section \"Non-Financial Statement\" for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- − the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023,\n- − the accompanying group management report (excluding the nonfinancial group statement) as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group\n\nmanagement report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development; we do not express an audit opinion on those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report and\n\n− the non-financial group statement included in section \"Non-Financial Statement\" of the group management report is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial group statement included in the group management report.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- ❶ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance\n- ❷ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property-casualty insurance\n- ❸ Measurement of financial instruments using parameters not observable on the market and forward-looking information\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n① Matter and issue\n\n- ② Audit approach and findings\n- ③ Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n### ❶ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance\n\n① In the consolidated financial statements of the Company, liabilities amounting to € 776,944 million (79.0 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported under the \"Insurance contracts liabilities\" balance sheet item, which are accounted for in accordance with \n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\nIFRS 17 beginning 1 January 2023. Of this amount, liabilities of € 680,654 million (69.2 % of the consolidated total assets) are relating to the life and health business segment. Within the life and health business segment, € 671,886 million of this is attributable to the liability, which is measured using the variable fee approach (VFA) or the general measurement model (GMM, also known as the building block approach).\n\nTo the extent that the above-mentioned liabilities are measured using the two measurement models, the measurement is based on complex actuarial methods (hereinafter referred to as the \"measurement methods\") on the basis of comprehensive processes for determining assumptions about future developments of the insurance portfolios to be valued. Within the measurement of the liabilities, the present values of the estimated future cash flows in particular are affected by possible material uncertainties. This uncertainty stems in particular from the methods used and the actuarial assumptions determined in connection with interest rates, investment income, mortality, disability, longevity, costs and policyholder behaviour.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the material significance of the amounts for the group's assets, liabilities and financial performance as well as the complexity of determining the underlying assumptions and estimates made by the executive directors, the measurement of these liabilities was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected controls of the Group for selecting the valuation methods applied as well as for determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued.\n\nWith the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we have compared the valuation methods and key assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods and industry standards and examined to what extent these are suitable for measuring the liabilities. One focus was the assessment of the cash flows used by the IT systems used as well as the appropriate derivation and use of assumptions for the measurement of selected liabilities.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate overall for measuring certain technical liabilities.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and \"Insurance operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### ❷ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property-casualty insurance\n\n① In the consolidated financial statements of the Company, liabilities amounting to € 776,944 million (79.0 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported under the balance sheet item \"Insurance contract liabilities\" which are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17 beginning 1 January 2023. Of this amount, liabilities € 96,339 million (9.8 % of the consolidated total assets) is attributable to the Property and Casualty Insurance business segment.\n\nWithin the insurance contracts liabilities, € 79,148 million is attributable to \"Liability for incurred claims\" in the property and casualty insurance segment, which recognises the expectations regarding insurance claims that have been incurred but not yet settled. These represent the company's expectation of future payments for known and unknown claims as well as the associated expenses. The company uses various methods to estimate these obligations. In addition, the measurement of this liability requires a significant degree of judgement by the executive directors of the Company regarding assumptions to be made, such as the impact of changing inflation rates, loss developments and regulatory changes. In addition, there is a significant judgement of the executive directors regarding the determination of the discount rate for calculating the liability. In particular, product lines with a low claims frequency, high individual claims or long claims settlement periods are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties.\n\nDue to the material significance of the amount of this liability for the Group's assets, liabilities, and financial performance as well as the considerable scope for judgement of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property and casualty insurance was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected controls of the Group for selecting actuarial methods as well as for determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in the property and casualty insurance.\n\nWith the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods and key assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods and industry standards and examined to what extent these are suitable for measuring the liabilities. Our audit also included an evaluation of the appropriateness and integrity of the data and assumptions, including the assessment of the executive directors regarding the impact of changing inflation rates, used in the valuation and a reconstruction of the claims settlement process. Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the liability for selected lines of product, in particular lines of product with large liability amounts or increased estimation uncertainties. For these lines of product, we compared the amounts calculated by us with the values determined by the Company for the liabilities and evaluated any differences. We also examined whether any adjustments to estimates in the loss reserves were adequately documented and substantiated.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate overall for measuring the technical liabilities in property and casualty insurance.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of liabilities for outstanding claims in property and casualty insurance are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and on \"Insurance operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### ❸ Measurement of financial instruments using parameters not observable on the market and forward-looking information\n\n① Financial instruments of € 721,802 million (73.4 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\nOf these financial instruments, financial assets totalling € 704,390 million are measured at fair value, of which in turn the fair values of € 220.967 million are calculated using valuation models or based on third-party value indicators. These financial instruments in particular relate to unlisted securities, other loans, \n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\nReport on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file Allianz SE\\_KA+KLB\\_ESEF-2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering, of Financial Statements and Management Reports, Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n− Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n\n- − Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- − Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- − Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n- − Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machinereadable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 4 May 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 11 May 2023.

January to 31. December 2023 including the related disclosures, which was prepared to comply with § [Article] 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act].\n\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Allianz SE are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of § 162 AktG. The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of § 162 AktG.\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by § 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by § 162 Abs. 1 and 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Allianz SE. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement. § 334 BGB [Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 26 February 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\n| Florian Möller          | Dennis Schnittger       |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Wirtschaftsprüfer       | Wirtschaftsprüfer       |\n| (German Public Auditor) | (German Public Auditor) |\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Allianz Sustainability Report 2023**\n\nImage /page/269/Picture/2 description: The image is a book cover with the Allianz logo in the upper left corner.

The handwriting is cursive and slightly stylized.\n\nIn 2023, the theme that dominated the global economy, capital markets and society alike was the fight against inflation. Over the past year, no one has been immune to inflation's corrosive effects on savings and the affordability of goods. The monetary policies that were taken to mitigate inflation now appear to have arrested its trajectory, but present manifold challenges both for businesses and consumers.\n\nThroughout a period in which our customers and partners experienced significant increases in their cost of living and challenges in sustaining their businesses, we maintained our focus on delivering the greatest possible value to them through our customer service and product offerings. For our shareholders, we steered our business model and managed our capital position to overcome inflationary challenges, ultimately contributing to a record performance. Our ability to manage inflation in all its forms is proving to be a distinct competitive advantage for Allianz.\n\nWe have successfully consolidated our leading position as one of the largest global insurers and active asset managers, one that is able to leverage its scale, global reach, and diversified business model to address the financial and protection needs of more people around the world. At the end of the 2023, our share price reached a 20-year high, our total business volume increased by 5.5 % to € 162 bn, and our operating profit reached another record level, rising by 6.7 % to € 14.7 bn.\n\nOur Property-Casualty segment grew strongly by 8.4 % to almost € 77 bn in total business volume. The operating profit topped € 6.9 bn for the first time, despite another year that was marked by increased claims resulting from more frequent and severe natural catastrophes. This clearly confirms our healthy underlying profitability and underwriting expertise.\n\nOur Life/Health segment demonstrated robust growth, with the value of new business increasing by 2.2 % to € 4.0 bn as we developed attractive solutions to protect our customers from the effects of inflation on their savings. The operating profit of € 5.2 bn was strong, making the Life/Health segment a resilient contributor to our earnings power.\n\nOur Asset Management segment proved resilient managing through a volatile environment to deliver an operating profit of € 3.1 bn. We recorded third-party net inflows of € 21.5 bn – a signal of active investors’ readiness to invest in the market through us – and we achieved growth in third-party assets under management to € 1.7 tn. Together with our continued strong investment outperformance, this bodes well for further improvements in growth and profitability.\n\nOur shareholders benefited from an outstanding total return of 27 % for the year, outperforming the European insurance sector, our direct peers, and the broader European stock market. This performance is backed by our financial strength and affirmed by the leading financial rating agencies which place Allianz in the top of our category, at AA (S&P Global), Aa2 (Moody's) and A+ (AM Best) respectively, and fully in line with our ratings objectives. Looking ahead, we will focus on unlocking the benefits of our scale, further increasing our productivity, and translating excellent customer experience into profitable customer growth.\n\nAlongside our strong financial performance, Allianz's organizational health further raises our confidence that our company will remain resilient in the face of volatility and be able to exceed our stakeholders' expectations in the future:\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nOur brand value is stronger than ever before. Allianz is the world's leading insurance and asset management brand for the fifth time in a row according to Interbrand's 2023 Best Global Brands ranking, with our brand value exceeding USD 20 bn for the first time. In addition, in an increasingly polarized world, Allianz remains the most trusted insurance brand among our peer set across all stakeholder groups, according to Edelman Trust Intelligence data. We embrace our societal responsibility and leverage our strength, stability, and skills to address the root causes of polarization and secure the future of those who put their trust in us.\n\n#### Our customers value the care and service we provide in their moments\n\nof greatest need. We evaluate our business performance based on the experience of our customers, as their satisfaction and loyalty are among the most important drivers of our growth. Our latest Net Promoter Score®results, which measure our customers' loyalty through customers' willingness to recommend Allianz, show that three-quarters of our operating entities outperformed their peers, a remarkable jump of 11 percentage points from last year. And we are also proud that 59 % of our operating entities have achieved the distinction of Loyalty Leadership status, which is a leading indicator for our future market expansion.\n\n#### Our success would be impossible without our engaged and healthy\n\nworkforce. We are therefore extremely proud that Allianz achieved record results in all three globally benchmarked indices of employee engagement against a declining industry trend: our Inclusive Meritocracy Index increased by 2 percentage points reaching best-inclass levels, our Work Well Index+ rose by 5 percentage points, and our Employee Engagement Index by 3 percentage points. In addition, our employee share ownership reached 70 %, which is a remarkable expression of our people's confidence in our organization. Our industry leadership in diversity reflects the strength of our workforce and its preparedness for the future, and this talent advantage is recognized by the global Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index 2023, which ranked Allianz first in the insurance category for the 5th consecutive year.\n\nHowever, our efforts to ensure resilience and to protect what is most valuable to our customers exceed our organization and touch on society at large. In 2023, we again demonstrated our industry leadership in sustainability by publishing our first comprehensive netzero transition plan – with concrete milestones to be achieved by 2030 – detailing our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in the investment of policyholder funds and our property and casualty portfolios by 2050.\n\nAs we look ahead, our corporate health and resilience are foundational to our ability to deliver strong results and returns amid even the most challenging environments – especially in the increasingly polarized world we live in today. We are well-prepared to lead in this context, drawing on the principles of sustainability, strength, and inclusion at which Allianz has excelled since our founding 134 years ago. Our company and our purpose are as relevant and important today as they have ever been, and we will not shy away from this calling.\n\nOn behalf of our management team and our employees, I thank you for your trust in the Allianz Group and look forward to earning your continued support in the year ahead.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nClair Zala\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT\n\n# Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs in previous years, the Supervisory Board comprehensively fulfilled its duties and obligations as laid out in the company's statutes and applicable law in the financial year 2023. It monitored the activities of the company's Board of Management, addressed the succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and advised the Board of Management on business management issues.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the Supervisory Board held six meetings and adopted one written resolution. The meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December. The written resolution was adopted in October. All meetings were held as in-person meetings.\n\nAt all meetings held in the financial year under review, the Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about the development of business at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. In particular, the Board of Management presented the development of Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management provided comprehensive information about the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including the planning as well as deviations of actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the Board of Management also regularly discussed the adequacy of capitalization, the solvency ratio of Allianz SE and the Group, and the corresponding stress and risk scenarios with the Supervisory Board. The annual and consolidated financial statements, including the respective auditor's reports, the half-year report as well as quarterly earnings releases were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the first half of 2023 in particular, the meetings again focused on the review of the Structured Alpha matter in close dialogue with the Board of Management, assisted by the law firm mandated by the Supervisory Board. The reports and deliberations also focused on the impact of rising inflation rates and interest rates on the overall economy and the insurance sector as well as a range of strategic topics, including the risk strategy and IT strategy, and the Board of Management's planning for the financial year 2024. The status of the digital implementation of the Allianz Customer Model by means of the Allianz Business Master Platform and the merger of the global MidCorp business with the business of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial was reported on at several meetings. Another regular item discussed was cyber risk security. The Supervisory Board also dealt extensively with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The deliberations of the Supervisory Board and in particular the Personnel Committee and Sustainability Committee also included establishing target achievement and setting targets for the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received regular, timely and comprehensive reports from the Board of Management. The Board of Management's oral reports at the meetings were prepared with written documents, sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in good time before the relevant meeting. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board in writing about important events, including between meetings. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management held regular discussions about key developments and decisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board held separate talks with each member of the Board of Management on each individual's status of target achievement, both for the respective half year and the full year.\n\nOnce again in 2023, individual and group training sessions were implemented on the basis of a development plan adopted for the further training of the members of the Supervisory Board, for example on the topics of cybersecurity, the sales strategy, and the auditing of financial statements.\n\nAt the meeting on 16 February 2023, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with the preliminary business figures for the financial year 2022 and the Board of Management's dividend proposal. The appointed audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC), Frankfurt am Main, reported in detail on the preliminary results of its audit. In the further course of the meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed the status of the measures taken to implement results from the audit carried out by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regarding the Group steering processes and the System of Governance. Comprehensive discussions were also held on the status of implementation of the actions adopted by the Board of Management following the Structured Alpha matter. The Supervisory Board also obtained a detailed report on the status of the investigations carried out by the external lawyers into the question of potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in connection with the Structured Alpha matter. The Board of Management also reported on PIMCO's Asset Management business, focusing in particular on governance topics. The Supervisory Board also discussed the target achievement of the individual members of the Board of Management and, on that basis, set their variable remuneration for the financial year 2022, subject to the approval of the annual financial statements. In this context, the Supervisory Board decided to make use of its discretion to take unforeseeable extraordinary developments into account in determining target achievement and to use the net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted for the effects of Allianz's divestment in Russia, as the basis for target achievement. Against the backdrop of the Structured Alpha matter, the Supervisory Board once more also discussed the question of the applicability of the so-called compliance caveat in paying variable remuneration components to members of the Board of Management. The independent investigations of potential breaches of duty by members of the Board of Management had already concluded in December 2022 that there were no indications of misconduct by any members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Hence there was no reason to apply the compliance caveat. As part of the performance assessment, the Supervisory Board carried out a fit and proper assessment of the \n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nmembers of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board also dealt with succession planning for the Supervisory Board. At the end of the meeting, the Supervisory Board held an executive session without the Board of Management members being present and discussed questions relating to succession planning for the Board of Management as well as the talks of the Supervisory Board Chairman with investors and proxy advisors.\n\nAt the meeting on 2 March 2023, the Board of Management first reported on the business developments to that date in the financial year 2023. The Board of Management also presented its report on the development of risks and solvency in the financial year 2022 and the outlook for 2023. The annual reports from Internal Audit and Compliance were also presented and discussed at the meeting. The Supervisory Board then discussed the audited annual and consolidated financial statements and the Management and Group Management Report, including the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, the solvency statements for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the Board of Management's recommendation for the appropriation of earnings. The auditor confirmed that there had been no discrepancies since their February report and issued an unqualified auditor's report for the individual and consolidated financial statements and for the solvency statements. The auditor did not have any reservations, either, regarding the audit of the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, which partly went beyond legal requirements. The Supervisory Board then approved the audited annual and consolidated financial statements. It approved the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of earnings for the financial year 2022, the Remuneration Report and the Supervisory Board Report, the Corporate Governance Statement, and the Non-Financial Statement. Furthermore, the Board of Management reported on the status of investigations into potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in relation to the Structured Alpha matter. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved, at the recommendation of the Audit Committee, to propose to the Annual General Meeting the election of PwC as auditor for the 2023 individual and consolidated financial statements and for the review of the half-year financial report for 2023, and to mandate PwC with the supplementary audit of the Remuneration Report and the Non-Financial Statement for the financial year 2023. Moreover, the Supervisory Board reviewed the agenda and proposals for resolution for Allianz SE's 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and approved the stipulations of the Board of Management for the virtual AGM. It also obtained extensive information on the status of implementation of the Allianz Business Master Platform. Lastly, the Supervisory Board dealt with succession planning for the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management.\n\nOn 4 May 2023, just before the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management briefed the Supervisory Board on business developments in the first quarter of 2023, as well as on the current situation of both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE, in particular with regard to the development of the Group's solvency. The Supervisory Board also once again dealt with the status of the measures initiated by the Board of Management following the Structured Alpha matter and the status of the measures to implement results of the audit carried out by the BaFin regarding the Group steering processes and the System of Governance.\n\nThe meeting on 23 June 2023 was held at Allianz UK in London.

The Supervisory Board also dealt with BaFin's findings from the review of the implementation of the insurance supervisory law requirements for IT and the measures initiated by the Board of Management in response to these findings. Furthermore, given the substantial progress in implementing the measures initiated following the Structured Alpha matter, and at the recommendation of the lawyers mandated by the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board decided to dissolve the Audit Committee working group specifically set up for this purpose in 2021 and to return to regular reporting. In addition, the Supervisory Board obtained a comprehensive report on the status of the merger of the global MidCorp business with the business of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial.

The Supervisory Board appointed Ms. Claire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre to the Board of Management of Allianz SE to succeed Mr. Terzariol with effect from 1 January 2024. Subsequently, the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the self-evaluation of the Supervisory Board required by supervisory law and the resulting development plan, which includes training programs on accounting and the internal model for the financial year 2024.

At all meetings, reports on legal and compliance issues within the Group, operational risks, the work performed by Internal Audit, and data privacy issues were presented and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the head of the actuarial function (Group Actuarial, Planning & Controlling) presented his annual report.\n\nThe Risk Committee held two meetings in 2023, both of which were held in person. At both meetings, the committee discussed the current risk situation of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with the Board of Management. At the March meeting, the Risk Report and other riskrelated statements in the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as management and Group management reports were reviewed with the auditor and acknowledged with approval. The appropriateness of the early risk detection system at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group and the result of further risk assessments by the auditor were also discussed. A recommendation was provided to the Audit Committee to include the Risk Report, as presented and discussed, in the Annual Report.\n\nAt both meetings, the Risk Committee extensively dealt with the risk strategy, risk appetite, capital management, the external rating, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management system for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE. In this context, the committee discussed the current implementation status of enhancements of the risk and control framework.

Moreover, the Risk Committee again dealt with the war in Ukraine, in particular with regard to possible scenarios for its further development, and its potential impact on the risk situation of Allianz. In addition, the Risk Committee intensively dealt with the impact of rising interest rates and inflation. In this context, discussions with the Board of Management and the head of the risk function focused, in particular, on potential effects on policy-holder termination behavior, as well as – with a view to liquidity risks – stress scenarios for the life insurance segment and the asset management segment as well as possible countermeasures. Furthermore, the Risk Committee dealt with the newly developed risk metrics for considering the asset management segment when establishing the risk capital requirements and obtained reports on the real estate portfolio, its quality, as well as current risk management measures.

Lastly, the Technology Committee received a report from the Board of Management on regulatory issues, for instance on the implementation of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).\n\nThe Nomination Committee held five meetings in the financial year 2023, all of which were held in person. A major focus was on succession planning for the Supervisory Board, in particular with regard to the elections to the Supervisory Board due in the next few years. The Nomination Committee intensively discussed potential candidates to succeed the members of the Supervisory Board who will be retiring in the coming years. Excellently suited candidates were identified for each retiring member of the Supervisory Board. They have all declared their willingness to stand for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meetings in 2024, 2025, and 2026. In addition, the Nomination Committee, together with the Board of Management and in consultation with BaFin, agreed on specific measures to prepare the candidates at an early stage for the duties of members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE. These measures include, for example, preparing candidates in the framework of a mandate or a guest role on the Supervisory Board of a European subsidiary of Allianz SE, or other suitable measures, as well as the early identification of training measures, taking particular account of the fitness requirements communicated by BaFin.

The management reports each also contain the Non-Financial Statement. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-year Financial Report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the solvency statements according to Solvency II as of 31 December 2023 for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group.

The auditors participated in the discussions and presented the results of their audit. Particular emphasis was placed on the key audit matters described in the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the solvency statements dated 31 December 2023 for both Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the related reports by PwC, were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the basis of its own reviews of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the management and Group management reports, and the recommendation for the appropriation of earnings, the Supervisory Board has not raised any objections and agreed with the results of PwC's audit.

Notwithstanding, key features of a German stock corporation – in particular the two-tier board system (Board of Management and Supervisory Board) and the principle of equal employee representation on the Supervisory Board – have been maintained by Allianz SE. The Corporate Constitution of Allianz SE is laid down in its Statutes. The current version of the Statutes is available on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance/statutes.html)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance/statutes.html)**.\n\n# Regulatory requirements\n\nThe regulatory requirements for corporate governance (System of Governance) applicable for insurance companies, insurance groups, and financial conglomerates apply. In particular, they include the establishment and further design of significant control functions (independent risk control function, actuarial function, compliance function, and internal audit) as well as general principles for an effective and proper business organization. These regulatory requirements are applicable throughout the Group in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The implementation of the regulatory requirements is supported by written guidelines issued by the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Furthermore, Solvency II requires the publication of qualitative and quantitative information, including a solvency statement. Details on the implementation of the regulatory requirements for corporate governance by Allianz SE and by the Allianz Group can be found in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report of Allianz SE and of the Allianz Group, which are published on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/results-reports/sfcr.html)**.\n\n# Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nGood corporate governance is essential for sustainable business performance. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE therefore attach great importance to complying with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (hereinafter \"Code\"), as amended from time to time. There are no statutory provisions on the basis of which recommendations of the Code are not applicable to Allianz SE. On 14 December 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued the following Declaration of Conformity of Allianz SE with the Code:\n\n#### **Declaration of Conformity in accordance with § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act**\n\nDeclaration of Conformity with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in accordance with §161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nSince issuing the last Declaration of Conformity on 15 December 2022, Allianz SE has complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission in the version of 28 April 2022, and will comply with the recommendations in the future.\n\nMunich, 14 December 2023 Allianz SE\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Management: Signed Oliver Bäte Signed Giulio Terzariol\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board: Signed Michael Diekmann\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE follows all suggestions of the Code in its version of 28 April 2022.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity and further information on corporate governance at Allianz is available on the **[Allianz company](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance.html)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/corporate-governance.html)**.\n\n# Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for setting business objectives and the strategic direction, for coordinating and supervising the operating entities, and for implementing and overseeing an appropriate and effective control and risk management system. The Board of Management also prepares the annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, the respective solvency statements, and the interim reports.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE currently has nine members. As a general rule, its members may not be older than 62. Further information on the members of the Board of Management can be found i[n Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.](#page-12-0) The composition is also available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/board-of-management.html)**, which also provides the CVs of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are jointly responsible for the management of the company and compliance with legal requirements. Notwithstanding this overall responsibility, the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nDivisional responsibilities for business segments and/or functional responsibilities are assigned to the individual departments. The latter include, inter alia, Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Mergers & Acquisitions. Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities.\n\nThe meetings of the Board of Management are convened and chaired by the Chairperson. In addition, any member of the Board may request a meeting, stating the proposed subject of discussion. As a rule, a meeting of the Board of Management was held every two weeks in the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Board of Management has a quorum if all members of the Board of Management have been invited to a meeting and at least half its members – including the Chairperson or a member of the Board of Management appointed by him – attend the meeting. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, the full Board of Management takes decisions with a simple majority of participating members. In the event of a tie, the Chairperson of the Board of Management has the deciding vote. The Chairperson can also veto decisions, but he cannot enforce a decision against the majority vote of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Board of Management has formed committees from among its members. The task of these committees is to coordinate and decide on matters of the Board of Management referred to them, to prepare decisions for the Board of Management reserved to it, and to submit are defined in the respective rules of procedure.\n\ncommittees were in place:\n\n#### **Board committees**\n\n| Board committees                                                                                                                                                                         | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Group committees                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group Finance and Risk Committee<br>Giulio Terzariol (Chairman),<br>Dr. Klaus-Peter Röhler,<br>Dr. Günther Thallinger,<br>Christopher Townsend,<br>Dr. Andreas Wimmer.                   | Preparing the capital and liquidity<br>planning for the Group and Allianz SE;<br>implementing and overseeing the<br>principles of group-wide capital and<br>liquidity management;

This comprises broad diversity with regard to gender, internationality, and educational as well as professional background.\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the achievement of such target, inter alia, on the basis of the following specific indicators:\n\n- − adequate proportion of women on the Management Board;\n- − adequate share of members with an international background (e.g., based on origin or extensive professional experience abroad), ideally with connection to the regions in which the Allianz Group is operating;\n- − adequate diversity with regard to educational and professional background, taking into account the limitations for the Supervisory Board by regulatory requirements (fitness).\n\nThis diversity concept is implemented via the appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management by the Supervisory Board. For the purpose of long-term succession planning, a list of candidates is prepared and updated on an ongoing basis by the Chairperson of the Board of Management in consultation with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. It is ensured that lists of successors will comprise appropriate percentages of candidates with international experience. This is especially taken into account by the Personnel Committee in succession planning. The list of candidates includes internal and external candidates generally meeting the requirements for a mandate in the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Management, the Personnel Committee, after a thorough examination, recommends a suitable candidate to the Supervisory Board plenary session. It also reports on the selection process and, if necessary, alternative candidates. Prior to an appointment to the Board of Management, all members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nCurrently, the Board of Management of Allianz SE comprises four female members, accounting for 44.4 %. Four members of the Board of Management have international backgrounds based on their origin. There is an adequate degree of diversity with regard to educational and professional backgrounds. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is thus composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has adopted a clear and comprehensible system for the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management remuneration system must be submitted to the General Meeting for approval whenever a material amendment is planned to be effected, but at least every four years. The most recent submission of the remuneration system for the Board of Management of Allianz SE to the General Meeting for approval was on 5 May 2021.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board must prepare a clear and comprehensible annual report on the remuneration of current and former Board members, which must be submitted to the General Meeting for approval each year.\n\nThe current remuneration system for the Board of Management and the Remuneration Report, including the auditor's report, are available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/remuneration.html)**.\n\nThe Board of Management reports regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board on business development, the company's net assets, financial position and earnings, planning and achievement of objectives, business strategy, and risk exposure. Details on the Board of Management's reporting to the Supervisory Board are laid down in the information rules issued by the Supervisory Board.\n\nImportant decisions of the Board of Management require approval by the Supervisory Board. Approval requirements are stipulated by law, by the Statutes, or in individual cases by decisions of the General Meeting. Supervisory Board approval is required, for example, for certain capital measures, intercompany agreements, and the launch of new business segments or the closure of existing ones. Approval is also required for acquisitions of companies and holdings in companies as well as for divestments of Group companies that exceed certain thresholds. Moreover, the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE in the version dated June 2021 (hereinafter \"SE Agreement\") requires the approval of the Supervisory Board for the appointment of the member of the Board of Management responsible for labor and social affairs.\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible for appointing the members of the Board of Management, determining their overall remuneration, succession planning for the Board of Management, and reviewing Allianz SE's and the Allianz Group's annual financial statements. The Supervisory Board's activities in the financial year 2023, including an individualized disclosure of the meeting participation, are described in th[e Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0)\n\nThe German Co-Determination Act (\"Mitbestimmungsgesetz\") does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is determined by general European SE regulations. These regulations are implemented in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the General Meeting. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE Works Council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement, which stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office includes four employee representatives from Germany – including one trade union representative – and one each from France and Italy. According to §17(2) SEAG, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall comprise at least 30% women and at least 30% men. The regular term of appointment for the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is four years. Moreover, a staggered board with different appointment periods was introduced with the elections to the Supervisory Board on 4 May 2022.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board is presented in the [Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0) Further information on the Supervisory Board members is presented in [Mandates of the Members of the](#page-12-0)  [Board of Management.](#page-12-0) Furthermore, the composition and a general description of the operations of the Supervisory Board are available on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html)**, which also provides the CVs of the Supervisory Board members.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes all decisions with a simple majority. The special requirements for appointing members to the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee, do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who – at Allianz SE – must be a shareholder representative. If there is a tie and the Chairperson is not present, the casting vote lies with the vice chairperson elected at the shareholder representatives' proposal. A second vice chairperson is elected at the employee representatives' proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities and the activities of its committees in the framework of a so-called self-assessment. The self-assessment is carried out either by means of an internal questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant. In 2023, the self-assessment was carried out using an internal questionnaire. The Supervisory Board plenary session discusses recommendations for improvements and adopts appropriate measures on the basis of recommendations from the Standing Committee. In addition, the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Supervisory Board are reviewed as part of an annual self-evaluation required by supervisory law, and a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on this basis. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee also hold regular sessions that are not attended by any of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nPart of the Supervisory Board's work is carried out by its committees. The Supervisory Board receives regular reports on the activities of its committees. The composition of committees and the tasks assigned to them are governed by the Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure, which can be found on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/supervisory-board.html)**.\n\n### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\n| Supervisory Board committees

Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations. These objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (\"GCGC\"). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise (\"Kompetenzprofil\") as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\nI. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n#### 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety. Therefore, no personal circumstances shall exist which – according to general experience – lead to the assumption that the diligent and orderly exercise of the mandate may be affected (in particular, administrative offenses or violation of criminal law, especially in connection with commercial activity).\n\n#### 2.

As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, the potential to influence the selection of employee representatives is limited.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept:\n\nAccording to the assessment of the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives – i.e., Ms. Boissard, Ms. Bosse, Ms. Chatterjee as well as Mr. Diekmann, Dr. Eichiner and Mr. Hainer – are independent within the meaning of the objectives (see No. I.3).\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee as a whole are familiar with the sector in which the company operates. All shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee, including the Chairperson of the Committee, have comprehensive expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Audit Committee, Dr. Eichiner, is a business administration graduate. He gained extensive knowledge and experience in both accounting and auditing during his many years as Chief Financial Officer of a DAX-listed company. Ms. Boissard also acquired extensive knowledge and experience in both of these areas during her many years as a member of the Audit Committee and as part of her role as CEO of Korian S.A.. Finally, Mr. Diekmann also has in-depth knowledge and experience in both areas due to his many years of service first as CEO and later as Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and long-standing member of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nThe employee representatives on the Audit Committee, Ms. Grundler and Mr. Le Goaër, also have expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing due to their long-standing membership of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nWith five female and seven male Supervisory Board members, the gender ratio of 30 % required under the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions is met. In addition, the Supervisory Board has five members with international backgrounds.\n\nThe skills profile is also met by the Supervisory Board as a whole. Based on the objectives for its composition, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has developed the following qualification matrix.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board of Allianz SE: Qualification matrix**\n\n|                             |                                          | Diekmann | Hainer | Boissard | Bosse  | Chatterjee  | Eichiner | Burkhardt-Berg | Le Goaër | Grundler | Kirsch | Lawrenz | Di Paolo |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|\n| Tenure                      | Joined Board in                          | 2017     | 2017   | 2017     | 2012   | 2022        | 2016     | 2012           | 2018     | 2016     | 2018   | 2015    | 2022     |\n| Personal<br>Appropriateness | Regulatory Requirement<br>(Fit & Proper) | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Independence1                            | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | No Overboarding1                         | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n| Diversity                   | Gender                                   | male     | male   | female   | female | female      | male     | female         | male     | female   | male   | male    | male     |\n|                             | Nationality                              | German   | German | French   | Danish | Singaporean | German   | German         | French   | German   | German | German  | Italian  |\n| Expertise                   | Accounting                               | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Insurance Actuarial<br>Practice          | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Investment<br>Management                 | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Technology                               | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Digital Transformation                   | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Employee Engagement                      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n|                             | Sustainability                           | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n| Regional<br>Expertise       | North America                            | ✓        | ✓      | -        | -      | ✓           | ✓        | -              | -        | -        | -      | -       | -        |\n|                             | Growth Markets                           | ✓        | ✓      | -        | -      | ✓           | ✓        | -              | -        | -        | -      | -       | -        |\n|                             | Europe (E.U.)                            | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        | ✓      | ✓           | ✓        | ✓              | ✓        | ✓        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |\n\n✓ Criteria met.

The corresponding resolution of the Annual General Meeting and the Remuneration Report, including the auditor's report, are available at the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/corporate-management/remuneration.html)**.\n\n## General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the General Meeting. The General Meeting elects the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board and decides on the approval of the actions taken by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. It decides, in particular, on the appropriation of net earnings, capital measures, the election of the auditor, and approval of intercompany agreements. It also decides on the approval of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management presented by the Supervisory Board, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, the approval of the Remuneration Report prepared by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as changes to the Company's Statutes. Resolutions of the General Meeting shall be passed, unless mandatory legal provisionsrequire otherwise, by a simple majority of the votes cast. In accordance with European regulations and the Statutes, amendmentsto the Statutesrequire at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast if less than half of the share capital is represented at the General Meeting. In addition, such resolutions require the simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution, unless higher thresholds are stipulated by law. When adopting resolutions, each share confers one vote.\n\nEach year, an Annual General Meeting is held, at which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board give an account of the preceding financial year. For special circumstances, the German Stock Corporation Act provides for the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting. If authorized by the Statutes, general meetings can also be held in virtual format.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nThe AllianzGroup has an appropriate and effective internal control system for reviewing and monitoring its operating activities and business processes, in particular financial reporting, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential, not only for the resilience and value of the company, but also to retain the confidence of the capital market, our customers, and the public. An assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization.\n\nIn addition, the Allianz Group has implemented an appropriate and effective framework and measures to identify, assess, manage, and communicate risks. For further information on the internal control system and risk management system of Allianz, please refer to th[e Risk](#page-129-0)  [and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and underpins the trust of our customers, shareholders, business partners, and employees.

Market Abuse Regulation to notify both Allianz SE and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of any transactions carried out by them involving shares or debt securities of Allianz SE or related financial derivatives or other related financial instruments as soon as the value of the acquisition or disposal transactions by the member reaches or exceeds € 20 thou in total within a calendar year. These disclosures are published on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/announcements/directors-dealings.html)**.\n\n# Accounting and auditing\n\nThe Allianz Group prepares its accounts according to §315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE are prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards.\n\nThe auditor of the annual financial statements and the auditor in charge of the review of the half-yearly financial report were elected by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023. The audit of the financial statements covers the individual financial statements of Allianz SE and the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group. In addition, the auditor audits the (Group) Management Report, including the Non-Financial Statement. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the solvency statements are also audited by the auditor, who also has to audit the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 were also subjected to a substantive audit by the auditor, in addition to the statutory audit scope.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe inform our shareholders, financial analysts, the media, and the general public about the Company's situation on a regular basis and in a timely manner. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, and the respective Management Reports are made publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided in the Allianz Group's half-yearly financial reports and quarterly statements. Information is also made available at the Annual General Meeting, at conference calls for analysts and journalists, and on the corporate website. The **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/conferences-presentations/financial-calendar.html)** also provides a financial calendar listing the dates of major publications and events, such as annual reports, half-yearly financial reports, quarterly statements, Annual General Meetings, and analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\n# Information in accordance with the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sectors\n\nThe section below outlines the targets set for Allianz SE and the other companies of the Allianz Group in Germany that are subject to codetermination (the \"subsidiaries concerned\") for the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nPursuant to §17(2) SEAG, the share of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has to be at least 30% each. The Supervisory Board fulfills this requirement as it includes five women (41.7%) and seven men (58.3%).\n\nPursuant to §16(2) SEAG, it has to be ensured that the Board of Management includes at least one female and at least one male member when appointing members to the Board of Management. This statutory requirement is met by the current Board of Management of Allianz SE. As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women on the Board of Management was 33.3%. Since 1 January 2024, the proportion of women on the Board of Management has been 44.4%.\n\nWith regard to the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management has set targets of 30% for each, to be met by 31 December 2024. As at 31 December 2023, this target was already met for the first management level with a percentage of women of 34.2%, but was not yet met for the second level with a percentage of 28.6%.\n\nWith regard to the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for nine of those eleven subsidiaries were set at 33%, the target quota for one subsidiary concerned was set at 35%, and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned was set at 50% for 31 December 2024. Eight of the eleven subsidiaries reached this target ahead of the due date as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe target quotas for the respective Boards of Management of the subsidiaries concerned were between 25% and 50% (35.7% on average) for 31 December 2024 and were already met by eight of the eleven companies as of 31 December 2023. For the subsidiaries concerned, the respective Boards of Management have set target quotas of 30% to 40% (32.9% on average) for 31 December 2024 for the first management level and target quotas of 30% to 43.5% (39.2% on average) for the second management level below the Board of Management. Due to internal restructurings, one of the eleven subsidiaries no longer has any employees below the level of the Board of Management. Therefore, reference will only be made to ten subsidiaries in the following paragraph.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the targets were met by four of the ten subsidiaries concerned for the first management level, while two of the ten companies met the target set for the second management level ahead of the due date. Despite increased efforts to promote women in the Allianz Group and in the individual subsidiaries, it was not possible to reach the targets ahead of the due date in the other cases as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for all vacant positions. Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>TAKEOVER-RELATED STATEMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to §289a and §315a of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB\") and § 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act (\"Aktiengesetz – AktG\").\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the share capital of Allianz SE was € 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 391,718,983 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval duly applied for may only be withheld if it is deemed necessary in the company's interest on exceptional grounds. The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up period. During the lock-up period, employees can exercise their voting rights.\n\nAllianz SE is not aware of any direct or indirect interests in the share capital that exceed 10% of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of Allianz SE's Board of Management is governed by Articles 9 (1), 39 (2) and 46 of the SE Regulation, §§84, 85 AktG, §24 (3) and §47 No. 1 of the German Insurance Supervision Act (\"Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – VAG\"), and the Statutes. According to the Statutes, the Board of Management shall consist of at least two persons; the Supervisory Board determines the number of any additional members (§5 (1) of the Statutes). The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to five years; reappointment is permitted for a maximum of five years in each case (§5 (3) of the Statutes). A simple majority of the votes cast in the Supervisory Board is required to appoint members to the Board of Management. In the case of a tie vote, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who pursuant to Article 42 of the SE Regulation must be a shareholder representative, shall have the casting vote (§8 (3) of the Statutes). If the Chairperson does not participate in the vote, the Vice-Chairperson shall have the casting vote, provided they are a shareholder representative. A Vice-Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (§8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments to the Statutes are governed by Article 59 SE Regulation, §179 AktG, and the Statutes. §13 (4) of the Statutes of Allianz SE stipulates that, unless mandatory law requires otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (§179 (1) AktG and §10 of the Statutes).\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may increase the company's share capital on or before 3 May 2027, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new registered no-par value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- − Up to a total of € 467,968,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/I): In case of a capital increase against cash contribution, the Board of Management may exclude the shareholders' subscription rights for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, including mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10%, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the stock market price. The Board of Management may furthermore exclude the shareholders' subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- − Up to a total of € 15,000,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/II): The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. New shares may only be issued to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies.\n\nThe company's share capital is conditionally increased by up to € 116,992,000 (Conditional Capital 2022). This conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participation rights, participation rights, and subordinated financial instruments issued against cash by Allianz SE or its subsidiaries, based on the authorizations granted by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, exercise their conversion or option rights, or to the extent that conversion obligations from such bonds are fulfilled, and to such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, the Board of Management may, until 3 May 2025, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10% of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (§71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under §§71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5% of the share capital.\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- − Our reinsurance contracts, in principle, include a clause under which both parties to the contract have an extraordinary termination right if and when the counterparty merges with another entity or its ownership or control situation changes materially. Agreements with brokers regarding services connected with the purchase of reinsurance cover also provide for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- − Allianz SE is also party to various bancassurance distribution agreements for insurance products in various regions. These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties have an extraordinary termination right in the event of a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.\n- − Shareholder agreements and joint ventures to which Allianz SE is a party often contain change-of-control clauses that provide, as the case may be, for the termination of the agreement, or for put or call rights that one party can exercise with regard to the joint venture or the target company, if there is a change of control of the other party.\n- − The framework agreements between Allianz SE and the subsidiaries of various car manufacturers relating to the distribution of car insurance by the respective car manufacturers each include a clause under which each party has an extraordinary termination right in case there is a change of control of the other party.\n- − In some cases, bilateral credit agreements provide for termination rights in the event of a change of control, mostly defined as the acquisition of at least 30% of the voting rights within the meaning of §29 (2) of the German Takeover Act (\"Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz – WpÜG\"). Where such termination rights are exercised, the respective credit lines have to be replaced by new credit lines under conditions then applicable.\n- − Allianz Group sponsoring and similar partnership agreements may provide for termination rights for the other party where there is a change of control in relation to Allianz SE. These termination rights are largely discretionary.\n- − Under the Allianz Equity Incentive Program, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) – i.e., virtual Allianz shares – are granted to senior management of the Allianz Group worldwide as a stock-based remuneration component. The conditions for these RSUs contain change-of-control clauses, which apply when a majority of the voting share capital in Allianz SE is directly or indirectly acquired by one or more third parties who do not belong to the Allianz Group, and which provide for an exception from the usual vesting and exercise periods. In line with the relevant general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for the non-application of the vesting period in the event of a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions influencing the share price are substantially different when there is a change of control.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe Remuneration Report describes the structure and arrangements of the remuneration system for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE. It explains the application of the remuneration system in the 2023 financial year, using detailed and individualized specifications on the remuneration of current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe report was jointly created by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, taking into consideration the requirements of §162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version.\n\nIt was also decided to allow the auditor to carry out a comprehensive, content audit of the Remuneration Report going above and beyond the legal requirements of §162 (3) AktG.\n\n# The remuneration year of 2023 at a glance\n\n### **The economic and geopolitical environment**\n\nIn the first half of the year in particular, 2023 was characterized by the continued dynamic inflation trend in many leading economies. Only in the second half of the year was a slow normalization of inflation rates achieved thanks to rapid interest rate hikes by central banks. The economic impact of high inflation and restrictive monetary policy was also evident on the international capital markets. In addition to high claims inflation, the insurance industry and asset management therefore also had to successfully navigate a very volatile investment environment. Natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria as well as thunderstorms in Germany, also posed major challenges for our industry in 2023. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East contributed to the challenging geopolitical and economic environment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee closely monitored business developments, particularly with regard to potential target achievement at Group level and individual remuneration targets at the half-year and year-end 2023. In addition to the financial targets, the non-financial targets and target achievement for 2023 were also discussed intensively, and changes to the Management Board were prepared and implemented.\n\n### **Group financial targets**\n\nThe annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI) allocation are based on two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50%.\n\nThe operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was exceeded to € 14.75 bn, as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Corporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 107.69% for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. In the Board's remuneration system, which will be submitted for approval by the 2025 Annual General Meeting, the Group's financial target of net income attributable to shareholders will be adjusted going forward by eliminating certain non-operating effects such as fluctuations from market movements.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100% target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00%.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85%.\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/16 description: The image contains two line graphs, one titled \"Operating profit\" and the other titled \"Net income attributable to shareholders\". The \"Operating profit\" graph shows the actual value for 2023 at 107.69%. The x-axis shows \"Floor\" at €7.1 bn, \"100% target\" at €14.2 bn, and \"Cap\" at €17.75 bn. The line graph increases from €7.1 bn to €14.75 bn, then plateaus. The \"Net income attributable to shareholders\" graph shows the actual value for 2023 at 100%. The x-axis shows \"Floor\" at €3.7 bn, \"100% target\" at €7.9-8.9 bn, and \"Cap\" at €11 bn. The line graph increases from €3.7 bn to €8.54 bn, then plateaus.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Board of Management performance in 2023**\n\nIn the financial year under review, the Board of Management faced unprecedented challenges requiring a team effort. In addition to the geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, the Board of Management had to meet supervisory requirements and adopt decisions to implement the digital future. These topics had to be jointly addressed by the entire Board of Management across the divisional areas of responsibility. The members of the Board of Management also successfully handled the additional tasks arising from the streamlining effected in the financial year under review. This applies in particular to the business activities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, Allianz X, and the implementation of IT verticalization and business model transformation.\n\nAs a result, the Board of Management achieved a record result in terms of operating profit and net income, despite a massive adverse impact resulting from natural disasters, high inflation, and rapidly rising interest rates. This strong overall performance was achieved on a sustainable basis: Customer satisfaction at Allianz once again reached top scores. The proportion of local business segments considered as market leaders in terms of customer satisfaction as measured by the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), for example, grew to 59%. Employee testimonials were also very positive. The Inclusive Meritocracy Index and Work Well Index Plus, which are used to measure employee satisfaction, rose to new record levels of 81% and 76%, respectively, bucking a negative trend in the industry. In addition, the Board of Management also met its ambitious environmental targets. Examples include CO2 emissions per employee, which were reduced by 62% versus the baseline year 2019 and were thus further reduced compared to the previous year (-57%) despite a normalization of travel behavior after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDue to the very good overall team performance of the Board of Management in all cross-divisional matters, for the first time the Supervisory Board unanimously decided to refrain from differentiating the individual contribution factor for the annual bonus for the 2023 financial year and to set a common factor of 1.15 for the regular Board members and to assess Mr. Bäte's performance in leading the Board of Management team with a factor of 1.17. Individual performance by the individual members of the Board of Management is described in detail below.\n\n### **Potential application of malus and clawback**\n\nIn the financial year, there was no reason to reduce the payment of variable remuneration (malus) or to reclaim variable remuneration already paid out (clawback).\n\n### **Approval of remuneration system and Remuneration Report**\n\nThe system for the remuneration of members of the Board of Management was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2021 with a majority vote of 87.14%. The remuneration system applies to all members of the Board of Management who were in office in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Remuneration Report for 2022 was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023 with a majority vote of 82.94%.\n\nOverall, the remuneration system and the Remuneration Report are strongly supported by investors and proxy advisors. In discussions with the Supervisory Board, it is emphasized, among other things, that the transparency provided with regard to Board of Management remuneration exceeds the best practice standard in Germany in many respects and that the Supervisory Board exercises its discretionary powers, as granted to them to the usual extent, very responsibly.\n\n### **Changes to the composition of the Board of Management**\n\nGiulio Terzariol was released from his mandate as a member of the Board of Management on 31 December 2023 so that he can pursue a career opportunity outside the company in his home country.\n\nClaire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre took over from Giulio Terzariol on 1 January 2024 and has been working with Mr. Terzariol on a seamless handover of his responsibilities.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\nRemuneration is designed to be appropriate compared to peer companies, given the Allianz Group's range of business activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the company that is in line with our corporate strategy. The key principles are as follows:\n\n- − Support of the Group's strategy: The design of variable compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects the business strategy and sustainable long-term development of the Allianz Group.\n- − Alignment of pay and performance: The performance-based variable component of the remuneration of members of the Board of Management forms a significant portion of the overall remuneration, corresponding to 70% of the target compensation.\n- − Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A major part of the variable remuneration reflects longer-term performance, with deferred payout (64%), and is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share price.\n\nThe Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee. If required, the Supervisory Board may seek outside advice from independent external consultants. The Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of Management members. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is generally not involved in discussion about their own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of the AktG in its currently valid version, as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nClarity and comprehensibility are ensured at all times. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation and regularly reviews the appropriateness of the remuneration. This is based on both a horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical comparison (in relation to Allianz employees). Again, the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\nThe structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n### **Horizontal appropriateness**\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE against other DAX companies and selected international companies (including, for example, the top positions in the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance), taking into account the company's position, and the Allianz Group's long-term performance, relative size, complexity, and internationality.\n\nAs part of the review in 2022 of the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Management, a need to adjust the level of remuneration for the Board members at Allianz SE was identified for 2023 and going forward. A comparison of Board of Management remuneration with the DAX 40 companies on the basis of turnover, number of employees and market capitalization shows that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Management Board and the ordinary members of the Management Board is below the comparative value. In addition, the reduction of the entire Board of Management to nine members and the associated redistribution of tasks led to an increase in the workload for the remaining Board members. For these reasons, the Supervisory Board deemed an increase in the annual target remuneration of 5% for all Board members to be appropriate. The exact amounts can be found in the graph relating to the overview of the structure of the target remuneration.\n\n### **Vertical appropriateness**\n\nThis comparison is based on the total direct remuneration of a member of the Board of Management and the average direct remuneration of an employee of the German Allianz companies. The Supervisory Board's decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this comparison for the previous financial year. For the 2022 financial year, the factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an employee was \"65\" and the factor for a regular Board member to an employee was \"37\". For the 2023 financial year, the respective factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an employee is \"68\" and the factor regular board member to employee is \"36\".\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following diagram provides an overview of the structure and amount of the target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/3 description: This image shows a breakdown of compensation components for CEO/BM in thousands of Euros. The total compensation is 100%, which amounts to 6,691 for CEO and 3,414 for BM. This is broken down into three main components: Base salary (30%), Annual bonus (25%), and Long-term incentive (LTI), deferred (45%). The base salary is 2,007 for CEO and 1,024 for BM and is a fixed amount. The annual bonus is 1,673 for CEO and 854 for BM and is determined by a target achievement factor (0-150%), which is a combination of group result (50% operating result, 50% net income) and individual contribution factor (0.8-1.2). The long-term incentive (LTI) is 3,011 for CEO and 1,536 for BM and is determined by an LTI payout factor (0-272%), which is a combination of target achievement factor annual bonus, 4-year share price development, relative performance factor (index comparison), and sustainability check (100% down to 0).\n\n| Shareholding<br>requirement                     | Shareholding requirement<br>• CEO: 2 x base salary<br>• BM: 1 x base salary<br>Total stock exposure, including<br>LTI at full run-rate:<br>• CEO: 8 x base salary<br>• BM: 7 x base salary |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pension provision<br>(pension<br>contributions) | • 15% of the target remuneration (50% of the base<br>salary)<br>• CEO: € 1,003 thou, BM: € 512 thou                                                                                        |\n| Severance payment                               | • Severance payment limit ≤ 2 x target remuneration<br>excluding pension contributions                                                                                                     |\n| Malus<br>Clawback                               | • Applicable to the entire variable remuneration:<br>• Malus: up to 100%<br>• Clawback: up to 3 years                                                                                      |\n| Cap                                             | • Remuneration cap including pension contributions<br>in € thou:<br>• CEO: € 11,750, BM: € 6,000                                                                                           |\n\nCEO = Chief Executive Officer, BM = regular Board member.\n\nConsideration of sustainability criteria.\n\n1\\_The cap of € 11,750 thou, or € 6,000 thou including pension contributions, limits the LTI effective payout to a maximum of 272% of the target allocation value.\n\n2\\_Review of target achievement for sustainability on the basis of financial, environmental, and social criteria.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Fixed remuneration**\n\nThe fixed remuneration components comprise the base salary, perquisites, and pension contributions. These components provide competitive remuneration to attract and retain Board of Management members with experience and skills that enable them to develop and successfully implement the Allianz Group's strategy. They secure a reasonable level of income in line with market conditions and promote a company management that is commensurate with risk.\n\n### **Base salary**\n\nThe base salary, which is not performance-related, is paid in twelve equal monthly installments.\n\n### **Perquisites**\n\nPerquisites mainly consist of contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and the provision of a company car and further individual perquisites if applicable. Perquisites are not linked to performance. Each member of the Board of Management is responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the level of perquisites; a contractual annual cap applies. If an appointment to the Board of Management requires a change of residence, relocation expenses are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.\n\n### **Pension contribution**\n\nTo provide competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\" are invested with a guarantee for the contributions paid but no further interest guarantee.\n\nEach year, the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is provided and, if so, to what extent. The current pension contribution generally represents 15% of the target remuneration of the Board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should Board membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management prior to 2015. Payments of social insurance contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also give rise to additional pension entitlements.\n\n### **Performance-based remuneration**\n\nThe performance-based variable remuneration includes the shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. This composition aims to balance short-term performance, longer-term success, and sustained value creation. The Supervisory Board ensures that the variable remuneration targets are challenging, sustainable, and ambitious.\n\n### **Annual bonus**\n\nThe annual bonus provides incentives for profitable growth and further development of the operating business by successfully implementing the business objectives for the respective financial year. In doing so, the overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities of the individual members of the Board of Management are taken into consideration.\n\nThe annual bonus is calculated by multiplying the target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus. It is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150% of the target amount.\n\n### **Long-term incentive – LTI**\n\nThe long-term, share-based remuneration is oriented mainly towards the sustainable increase in the enterprise value. Taking the share price performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nOther stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting strategic sustainability targets. The achievement of these targets forms the basis for the final assessment at the end of the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nAlmost two thirds (64%) of the variable remuneration is sharebased, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the company in the Board of Management remuneration.\n\n### **Additional remuneration principles**\n\n### **Shareholding obligation and shareholding exposure**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are obliged to build up the following degree of share ownership within three years:\n\n- − Chairperson of the Board of Management: two times base salary, i.e., € 4,013 thou,\n- − Regular Board of Management member: one time base salary, i.e., € 1,024 thou.\n\nOwnership is required for the entire term of service on the Board of Management. Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay component conversion. In the event of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The ownership obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to Allianz stock. This amounts to approximately 800% of base salary for the Chairperson and approximately 700% of base salary for a regular Board member.\n\n### **Malus/clawback**\n\nIn order to ensure sustainable corporate development and to avoid taking inappropriate risks, variable remuneration components may not be paid, or payment may be restricted, in the event of a significant breach of the Allianz Code of Conduct or regulatory Solvency II policies or standards, including risk limits.\n\nIn the same way, variable remuneration components already paid may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout. Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may be implemented if this is required by the supervisory authority (BaFin) in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n### **Payout cap**\n\nIn accordance with §87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nThus, the actual payout for the underlying financial year – comprising the base salary, variable remuneration and pension service cost – will be capped at maximum of € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management, and at € 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management. If the remuneration for the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable remuneration accordingly.\n\nThis payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the 2019 financial year. Given that the actual amount of the long-term variable remuneration paid out cannot be determined until after vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration Report for the 2024 financial year.\n\n#### **Deviation from the remuneration system**\n\nThe Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory requirements (§87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account both macroeconomic and company-related exceptional circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and profitability of the company. The deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee.\n\nParticular components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include the base salary, the annual bonus and the LTI, including their relationship to each other, their respective assessment bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement assessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should not exceed a period of four years. In a crisis situation, for example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new Board member with skills such as crisis management expertise, with a remuneration structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to deviate from the remuneration system.\n\n#### **Remuneration adjustment**\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary unforeseeable developments when determining the amount of the variable remuneration components. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases.\n\nConceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target remuneration of members of the Board of Management, insofar as this is appropriate to ensure that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board of Management or a regular member of the Board of Management is appropriate with regard to their duties and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the horizontal and vertical comparison of the Board of Management remuneration. The aim of this rule is to moderately adjust Board of Management remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and thus to avoid major salary increases.\n\nRather than being automatic, adjustment requires a justified decision by the Supervisory Board on a case-by-case basis. Such a moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself represent a significant change to the remuneration system. These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective Remuneration Report for the financial year.\n\n### **Termination of service**\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n#### **Severance payment cap**\n\nPayments for early termination to Board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the annual compensation, consisting of the last financial year's base salary and 100% of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is made on a prorata basis for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in the event of premature termination of service.\n\n#### **Transition payment**\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a transition payment after leaving the Board of Management. The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25% of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, this pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, the remittance of the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.\n\n### **Miscellaneous**\n\n#### **Internal and external Board appointments**\n\nWhen a member of the Board of Management simultaneously holds an appointment at another company within the Allianz Group or their joint ventures with outside partners, the full amount of the respective remuneration is transferred to Allianz SE.\n\nIn recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, Board members are also allowed to accept a limited number of nonexecutive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50% of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE.\n\nThe respective Board member will only retain the full remuneration for that position if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board classifies the appointment as a personal one *(ad personam)*. Any remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those organizations' annual reports; the level of remuneration will be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Target achievement factor to determine the variable remuneration**\n\nIn line with the overarching strategic objective \"simplicity wins\", the calculation of variable remuneration follows a simple system. The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50%. The resulting target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division and the performance of the individual Board member. If targets are not met, the variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150%.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram that outlines the calculation of a target achievement factor. On the left, within a blue border, it states: \"Target achievement factor (maximum 150%) to determine: annual bonus and LTI grant value\". On the right, within a light blue border, it details the calculation: \"Group financial targets\" are determined by adding \"Operating profit (50%)\" and \"Net income attributable to shareholders (50%)\". The result is then multiplied by the \"Individual contribution factor 0.8-1.2\".\n\n### **Group financial targets**\n\nThe Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to shareholders. Adjustments are only applied to acquisitions and disposals that account for more than 10% of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders, or that have a valueadding effect from a risk management perspective (e.g., portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nOperating profit highlights the underlying performance of ongoing core operations.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling interests (minorities). Furthermore, the net income forms the basis for the dividend payout, as well as for calculating the return on equity. Both key performance indicators (KPIs) are important steering parameters for the Allianz Group and therefore reflect the level of implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group's financial target achievement is limited to a maximum of 150% and can drop to zero.\n\nThe minimum, target, and maximum values for the Group financial targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board. These targets are documented for the respective next financial year and published ex-post in the Remuneration Report.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Individual contribution factor (ICF): 0.8 -

The ICF is based on an assessment by the Allianz SE Supervisory Board of performance, sustainability and strategic goals, based on KPIs reflecting the respective Board member's area of responsibility and their personal contribution.\n\n- − Strategic priority: An individual strategic priority will be set for every Board member at the beginning of each performance year, linked to a corresponding KPI and qualitatively assessed by the Supervisory Board. In addition, overarching strategic goals that apply to all Board members are set.\n- − Performance (business division targets): For Board members with business-related division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance is based on various indicators of profitability (e.g., operating profit and net income) and productivity (e.g., expense ratio) for the respective business division. For Board members with a functional focus, division-\n\nresponsibilities, and are qualitatively assessed.\n\n− Sustainability targets: Non-financial sustainability targets take into account customer satisfaction (e.g., digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), employee engagement (e.g., Allianz Engagement Survey), and leadership quality. The assessment of the individual leadership quality also includes a review of behavioral aspects, such as customer orientation, collaborative leadership, entrepreneurship, and trust (e.g., corporate social responsibility, integrity, diversity, and sustainability as measured by the greenhouse gas reduction of Allianz companies and by the development of a roadmap to reduce CO2 emissions in the context of capital allocation).\n\nspecific performance targets are determined based on their key Additional information, in particular regarding the annual sustainability targets for the Allianz SE Board of Management can be found in the [Non-Financial Statement](#page-55-0) for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram of the LTI (Long-Term Incentive) allocation process. It starts with the LTI allocation value, which is the LTI target multiplied by the annual bonus target achievement factor (maximum 150%). This leads to the grant of virtual shares, so-called Restricted Stock Units. The next step involves a 4-year Allianz share price development (factor, with maximum 200% at payout), which is combined with a 4-year Allianz relative performance vs. STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index (factor, with maximum 200% at payout). These two factors are then combined with a sustainability check (100% to 0%). Finally, the payout is determined by the current share price in March n+5, adjusted by the relative performance and the sustainability check. A timeline shows the performance year (n), with n+1 corresponding to March 2024 (Allocation LTI/RSU 2023/2024) and n+5 corresponding to March 2028 (Payout LTI/RSU 2023/2024).\n\n#### **Determining the individual contribution factor (ICF)**\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the ICF for each member of the Board of Management based on the fulfillment of the individual performance indicators. Most of the performance indicators are provided with quantitative criteria, and therefore offer a sufficiently concrete basis for the combined assessment.\n\nEach ICF category – strategic priority, performance, and sustainability – has a significant weighting, and all three categories are of equal importance and make an equal contribution to the overall assessment. However, the individual indicators are not weighted on a fixed percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis of a formulaic calculation. This allows the Supervisory Board to take appropriate consideration of the individual criteria and to react appropriately to changes in priorities during the year. In particular, significantly underperforming in one category should allow a low overall rating without being balanced out by the other indicators.\n\nSince performance is determined without a specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n### **Long-term incentive (LTI) design**\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders and reflects the sustainable implementation of the company's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n- − Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, known as restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount, divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n\t- − The LTI allocation amount is calculated by multiplying the LTI target amount by the annual bonus achievement factor, and capped at a maximum of 150% of the target level.\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>− The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual financial media conference [1](#page-33-0). As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on the relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, and the results of the sustainability assessment.\n\n− Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share (\"Allianz TSR\") and the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index (\"Index TSR\") between the start and end of the four-year\n\n1\\_For accounting purposes, the determination of the fair value of RSUs is based on an option pricing model, taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends. The value of the RSUs used for the board members' compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nperformance factor, which is calculated as follows:\n\n- − At the end of the contractual vesting period, the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in percentage points; the result is multiplied by \"2\" because the comparison with competitors and the market is critically important, so the outperformance/underperformance is given a twofold weighting.\n- − To determine the factor, 100 percentage points are added to the result. Example: 1 percentage point outperformance results in a relative performance factor of 102%; 1 percentage point underperformance results in a relative performance factor of 98%.\n\nIn order to avoid incentivizing excessive risk-taking, the relative TSR performance factor is limited: it can vary between zero (for underperformance of the index by -50 percentage points or lower) and 200% (for outperformance of the index by minimum +50 percentage points or higher).\n\ncontractual vesting period. The payout is based on the TSR – Sustainability assessment: Prior to the payout of each LTI tranche, the Personnel Committee makes a preliminary assessment before the Supervisory Board determines, whether there are any sustainability-related concerns regarding a full payout. If any concerns are identified, payment of the tranche may be cancelled in full or in part.\n\n#### The sustainability assessment covers:\n\n- − compliance breaches,\n- − balance sheet issues, such as reserve strength, solvency, indebtedness, and ratings,\n- − KPIs contained in the individual Board members' targets, such as dNPS, employee satisfaction, and climate targets.\n\nThe assessment is made by applying a comparable basis; i.e., any regulatory changes, changes in accounting regulations, or changes in calculation methods for the KPIs in question are taken into account.\n\n− Allianz share performance, payout, and cap: Following the end of the four-year contractual vesting period, the granted RSUs are settled in cash, based on the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective RSU plan vests, multiplied by the relative TSR performance factor, and adjusted by the sustainability assessment, if necessary. The relevant share price is capped at 200% of the grant price. Likewise, the relative TSR performance factor is capped at a maximum of 200%. Taking into account the overall compensation cap (€ 6,000 thou for a regular Board member and € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management), the LTI payout in relation to the LTI target – which deviates from the individual LTI component caps – is limited to 272%.\n\nOutstanding RSU holdings are forfeited should a Board member leave at their own request or be terminated for important cause.\n\n### **Illustrative examples:**\n\n#### **LTI payout: performance exceeds expectation (scenario 1)**\n\n|

financial targets and target achievement**\n\nThe degree of target achievement for the Group's financial targets is calculated as the simple average of the target achievement of the operating profit for the year and the net income attributable to shareholdersfor the year. The operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was exceeded to € 14.75 bn as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health,\n\nCorporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 107.69 % for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100 % target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn. Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00 %.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85 %.\n\n### **Group financial target achievement 2022 und 2023**\n\n| Group financial target achievement | Operating profit |        | Net income attributable to shareholders |           | Achievement level combined in % |        |\n|------------------------------------|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Financial year                     | 2022             | 2023   | 2022                                    | 2023      | 2022                            | 2023   |\n| Bonus curve                        |                  |        |                                         |           |                                 |        |\n| 0 % - Floor in € bn                | 6.70             | 7.10   | 3.60                                    | 3.70      |                                 |        |\n| 100 % - Target in € bn             | 13.40            | 14.20  | 7.20                                    | 7.9 - 8.9 |                                 |        |\n| 150 % - Max in € bn                | 16.75            | 17.75  | 9.00                                    | 11.00     |                                 |        |\n| Target achievement                 |                  |        |                                         |           | 105.35                          | 103.85 |\n| Achievement level in € bn1         | 14.16            | 14.75  | 7.17                                    | 8.54      |                                 |        |\n| Achievement level in %             | 111.40           | 107.69 | 99.29                                   | 100.00    |                                 |        |\n| Weight in %                        | 50.00            | 50.00  | 50.00                                   | 50.00     |                                 |        |\n|                                    |                  |        |                                         |           |                                 |        |\n\n1\\_The 2022 operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders shown in this table (and also in the following tables within the Remuneration Report) are as published in the Annual Report 2022 and have not been adjusted to reflect the application of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), which have been adopted as of 1 January 2023.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Individual performance indicators and application of the individual contribution factor**\n\n \n\nIn order to calculate the annual bonus, the target achievement level of the Group's financial targets is multiplied by the individual contribution factor (ICF).

In addition to the very good financial performance, his strong personal commitment also helped the company to again achieve top scores for brand value as well as customer and employee satisfaction, forming an excellent basis for the continued successful development of Allianz. With regard to the Capital Markets Day to be held in December 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see the formulation and implementation of the updated corporate strategy in the new financial year. Moreover, the initiatives launched to deliver further productivity gains in the core business and accelerate profitable customer growth are expected to be consistently pursued.\n\nSirma Boshnakova successfully drove the growth of the platform business ahead in the completed financial year: Apart from the continued strong development of Allianz Partners, Ms. Boshnakova successfully launched the Solvd claims service platform in several markets. The Allianz Direct direct insurance company also reported robust growth and was migrated to a new IT infrastructure. In addition, the conclusion of a partnership in the bancassurance channel in the Netherlands forms an important basis for further growth. Alongside the continued scaling of Solvd, the Supervisory Board expects Ms. Boshnakova's area of responsibility to deliver further improvement in profitability in 2024.\n\nBarbara Karuth-Zelle delivered significant progress in major technology projects, in particular the realignment of the Business Master Platform. She also achieved considerable enhancements of the stability of infrastructure services and user satisfaction with workplace services. Ms. Karuth-Zelle was also responsible for the implementation of important productivity and digitalization initiatives. In addition, Ms. Karuth-Zelle consistently improved the company's IT security and reinforced Group IT Governance by driving ambitious transformation projects forward. Also, the economic management of the IT budget progressed in the completed financial year. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see continued steady improvements, particularly with regard to the speed of implementation and profitability of the IT portfolio, as well as significant and visible productivity gains at Allianz Technology.\n\nKlaus-Peter Röhler delivered further productivity gains in the portfolio he manages by and drove important transformation projects forward within the Allianz Group. The significant improvement in customer satisfaction, for example in life insurance in Germany and Switzerland, is particularly noteworthy. Employee satisfaction also continued to improve year-on-year in almost all subsidiaries in Mr. Röhler's portfolio. The achievement of financial targets in Mr. Röhler's portfolio was adversely affected by losses from natural disasters, particularly in Germany. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see further efficiency gains through IT investments and the consistent further development of pricing and claims models in property insurance, particularly with regard to the mapping of natural events resulting from climate change.\n\nAs CFO, Giulio Terzariol once again contributed significantly to the company's very solid position in all key financial indicators. Despite an extremely challenging economic environment, he further strengthened the solvency ratio, achieved the confirmation of or even improvements in key credit ratings, and safeguarded Group liquidity. He was also instrumental in ensuring that the high inflation rate only had a moderate impact on the combined ratio in property insurance and the Group result. Mr. Terzariol also successfully implemented the integration of the control functions and strengthened Group Governance in the long term. After a career spanning 25 years at Allianz with assignments in various places including the U.S., Asia and at the Munich head office, Mr. Terzariol left the company at the end of the year at his own request. The Supervisory Board thanks Mr. Terzariol for his outstanding contributions to the sustainable success of Allianz and wishes him all the best for the future.\n\nGünther Thallinger once again achieved a solid investment result in a challenging capital market environment characterized by extreme interest rate increases in many economies. Moreover, Mr. Thallinger's consistent reallocation of the investment portfolio helped secure the company's strong positioning, even with regard to a potential continued increase in capital market volatility, as well as Group liquidity. Allianz's leading position in the area of sustainability was further expanded, in particular due to Mr. Thallinger's strong personal commitment in formulating and implementing the new, ambitious Net-Zero Plan. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see a consistent adjustment of the investment portfolio to the changing economic framework, taking account of capital market requirements, as well as further profitable growth in the health insurance business.\n\nChristopher Townsend again achieved strong results in the Commercial Lines business in the 2023 financial year, driven by a very gratifying performance delivered by both Allianz Commercial and Allianz Trade. The entities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, newly allocated to his area of responsibility, also delivered notably improved results. In addition, Mr. Townsend continued to drive the development of the global Commercial Lines business forward. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see sustained improvements in the results of Allianz UK and the realization of the financial targets and visible productivity gains from the globalization of the Commercial Lines business.\n\nRenate Wagner quickly adjusted to her new responsibility for the Asia-Pacific business in the completed financial year and achieved robust growth and solid profitability despite continued challenges in Australia. Moreover, Ms. Wagner's efforts relating to the workforce and culture at Allianz again delivered very good results. Examples include employee satisfaction, which reached a record level and the top score among Allianz's competitors in the completed financial year. Allianz once again won several awards to honor its success in the area of Diversity & Inclusion. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects further profitable growth in Asia and improved results in Australia. Furthermore, strategic HR planning will remain a top priority in times of shortages of skilled labor.\n\nAndreas Wimmer safeguarded the resilience of the Asset Management business segment and U.S. Life Insurance in a very challenging capital market environment. In Asset Management, he cushioned adverse market effects through disciplined cost management and achieved robust new business despite strong volatility. In addition to very good growth in U.S. Life Insurance, he also successfully drove an ambitious IT transformation forward. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see the expansion of business with alternative asset classes for third-party customers and the consistent continuation of the integration of the Life Insurance and Asset Management business segments in order to strengthen the resulting business opportunities and the capital efficiency of the Allianz Group.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Overview target achievement and variable remuneration for the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the amounts for annual payout and LTIallocation resulting from the target achievement of the financial year, as well as the target, minimum, and maximum amount of the variable compensation components.\n\n### **Target achievement and variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management for the financial year**\n\n|                                               |      |                                   | Target achievement |                                 |        |        | Annual bonus |        |        |        | LTI allocation1 |            |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|--|\n| Board member                                  |      | Group<br>financial<br>performance | ICF                | Target<br>achievement<br>factor | Target | Min    | Max          | Payout | Target | Min    | Max             | Allocation |  |\n| Active Board members in 2023                  |      | %                                 | 0.8-1.2            | %                               | € thou | € thou | € thou       | € thou | € thou | € thou | € thou          | € thou     |  |\n| Oliver Bäte                                   | 2023 | 103.85                            | 1.17               | 121.50                          | 1,673  | -

It includes the payments made in the financial year for base salary, perquisites, and other remuneration. For the variable remuneration, the components for performance fully rendered in the financial year are reported. This requirement is met where the applicable performance criteria are fulfilled and conditions subsequent and suspensive have been met or have ceased to exist. For the 2023 financial year, this is the annual bonus that refers to the 2023 performance period and is paid out in March 2024. For the sharebased renumeration, the payout of the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) RSU allocated in 2019 for the 2018 financial year, which vested in the 2023 financial year, is reported.\n\nThe additional table \"Remuneration for the financial year\" goes above and beyond the requirements of §162 AktG. It includes the contributions to base salary and perquisites made in the respective financial year, as well as the annual bonus for the respective financial year and the allocation amount of the share-based remuneration for the financial year.\n\nThe amounts for the annual bonus and LTI allocation reported here result from the achievement of the targets for the financial year. The information therefore directly depicts the correlation between remuneration and business development.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration for the financial year is decisive for reviewing the retention of the general payout cap of € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management and € 6,000 thou for a regular member. It is reviewed prior to the payout in 2028 of the LTI tranches allocated for the 2023 financial year, and reported in the Remuneration Report for the respective financial year.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed in both tables, even if these expenses are not regarded as remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 AktG. Finally, in addition to the absolute amounts, the share of the individual remuneration components relative to the total remuneration is stated.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the information provided for by the Stock Corporation Act on remuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management is shown in a separate table.\n\nThe following diagram presents the allocation of the remuneration components in the two tables, using the financial year 2023 as an example:\n\nImage /page/39/Figure/12 description: The image is a timeline diagram illustrating the remuneration process for Allianz employees. The timeline spans from the financial year when remuneration is determined, pursuant to Section 162 AktG (payout), to the year 2028. Key elements include 'LTI/RSU 2023/2024,' 'Fixed remuneration + annual bonus 2023,' and 'Remuneration for the financial year (actual grant).' The timeline also notes 'AEI 2019 RSU,' which ended its performance period and payout in 2023. Important dates are marked, such as March 2024 for the payment of the annual bonus and allocation of LTI/RSU 2023/2024, and March 2028 for the payout of LTI/RSU 2023/2024. A key performance indicator is the four-year performance of the Allianz share, based on absolute share price performance and relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Remuneration in the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 (1) sentence 1 AktG.

According to the remuneration system applicable at the time of the allocation, the RSU payout is solely dependent on the absolute share price performance and capped at 200% above the grant price. During the term of the AEI/RSU 2019 tranche, the decisive price of the Allianz share rose from € 193.66 to € 219.06. The increase, and therefore the payout, remained significantly below this cap.\n\n### **Remuneration for the financial year**\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration for the financial year. It contains the variable remuneration amounts resulting directly from the target achievement of the financial year: the annual bonus – as in the remuneration in the financial year table above – and the allocation amount of the LTI grant for the financial year.\n\n#### **Individual remuneration: 2023 and 2022**\n\n€ thou (total might not sum up due to rounding)\n\n|                                               |      |  | Fixed compensation |             |        | Variable short-term |        | Variable long-term          |        |                    |        | Total             | Pension         |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|--|--------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| Board members                                 |      |  | Base salary        | Perquisites |        | Annual bonus        |        | Share-based<br>compensation |        | Other compensation |        | compen-<br>sation | service<br>cost | Total |       |\n| Board members active in financial year        |      |  | € thou             | in % of TC  | € thou | in % of TC          | € thou | in % of TC                  | € thou | in % of TC         | € thou | € thou            | € thou          |       |       |\n| Oliver Bäte                                   | 2023 |  | 2,007              | 26          | 35     |                     | 2,033  | 26                          | 3,658  | 47                 | -

The earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement – operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nDr. Günther Thallinger received the share-based compensation for the first time in the 2022 financial year and Giulio Terzariol in 2023. The significant change from 2020 to 2021 in Dr. Klaus-Peter Röhler's remuneration is explained by the fact that he joined the Board of Management during the year, so the remuneration reported for 2020 is pro rata only. The same rationale applies to the increase from 2021 to 2022 in Dr. Andreas Wimmer's remuneration, as he joined during 2021.\n\nRemuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management for the financial years following their departure comprises mainly pension payments, share-based compensation payouts, and other remuneration.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Comparative presentation**\n\n|                                                    | Development of Board of Management compensation, profit, and average compensation of employees |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--|\n| Financial year                                     | 2019                                                                                           | Change<br>2019 to 2020<br>in % | 2020  | Change<br>2020 to 2021<br>in % | 2021  | Change<br>2021 to 2022<br>in % | 2022  | Change<br>2022 to 2023<br>in % | 2023  |  |\n| Board of management compensation in € thou         |                                                                                                |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n| Board members active in financial year             |                                                                                                |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |  |\n| Oliver Bäte                                        | 5,058                                                                                          | 6                              | 5,350 | 11                             | 5,912 | (4)                            | 5,660 | 12                             | 6,357 |  |\n| Sirma Boshnakova (appointed: 01/2022)              | -

Furthermore, the structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly reviewed with regard to its compliance with German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n- − The set total remuneration is both aligned with the scale and scope of the Supervisory Board's duties and appropriate in view of the Company's activities and its business and financial situation. This also reflects the contribution made by the monitoring activity of the Supervisory Board to the long-term development of the Company.\n- − The remuneration takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, or Committee memberships.\n- − The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of management as well as independent decisions on executive personnel and remuneration.\n- − Given Allianz's relative size and complexity as well as its sustainable performance, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board is oriented towards the fourth quartile of the supervisory board remuneration of peers in the DAX.\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE provides for a fixed remuneration. Supervisory Board members who had only served on the Supervisory Board during part of the financial year receive one twelfth of the remuneration for each month of service commenced. This shall apply accordingly for membership of Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Remuneration System was presented to the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE on 4 May 2023 and was approved with a majority vote of 95.07 %.\n\n### **Fixed annual remuneration**\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the financial year. Each regular Supervisory Board member receives a fixed remuneration amounting to € 150 thou per year. The Chairperson receives € 450 thou, each Deputy Chairperson receives € 225 thou.\n\n### **Committee-related remuneration**\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration which is also paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the financial year. The committee-related remuneration is as shown in the graph below:\n\n### **Attendance fees and expenses**\n\nIn addition to the fixed and committee-related remuneration, members of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of € 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend in person. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. The attendance fee is payable after the respective meeting.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with their Supervisory Board activities. The company provides insurance coverage and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties.\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/18 description: The image shows a table describing the fixed annual remuneration and committee remuneration for different positions. Under the category of fixed annual remuneration, the chairperson receives €450,000, the deputy chairperson receives €225,000, and a regular member receives €150,000. Under the category of committee remuneration, the chairperson receives €150,000 for the audit committee, €50,000 for the standing committee, and €25,000 for the nomination committee. A member receives €75,000 for the audit committee, €25,000 for the standing committee, and €12,500 for the nomination committee.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration awarded and due in accordance with §162 AktG.

following overview compares the annual development of the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the average remuneration of employees, and selected earnings parameters over the last five financial years. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board presented in the table corresponds to the total remuneration awarded and due in the respective financial year.\n\nIn the case of Ms. Rashmy Chatterjee and Mr. Primiano Di Paolo, the significant change from 2022 to 2023 is due to the fact that only pro rata remuneration is reported for both of them for the 2022 financial year, as they joined the Supervisory Board during the year.\n\nThe earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement – operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of fulltime equivalents.\n\n#### **Comparative presentation**\n\n|                                                                                                                                         | Comparative information | Development of Supervisory Board compensation, profit, and average compensation of employees |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| Financial year                                                                                                                          | 2019                    | Change<br>2019 to 2020<br>in %                                                               | 2020  | Change<br>2020 to 2021<br>in % | 2021  | Change<br>2021 to 2022<br>in % | 2022  | Change<br>2022 to 2023<br>in % | 2023  |\n| Supervisory Board compensation in € thou                                                                                                |                         |                                                                                              |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n| Active members in financial year                                                                                                        |                         |                                                                                              |       |                                |       |                                |       |                                |       |\n| Michael Diekmann                                                                                                                        | 484.0                   | -

The Allianz Group serves around 125 million private and corporate customers[1](#page-52-1). Allianz SE, the parent company of the Allianz Group, has its headquarters in Munich, Germany.\n\nThe Allianz Group's structure reflects both our business segments and geographical regions. Business activities are organized by product and type of service, based on how these are strategically managed: insurance activities, asset management activities, and corporate and other activities. Due to differences in the nature of products, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into the two categories property-casualty and life/health. In accordance with the Board of Management's responsibilities, each of the insurance categories is grouped into regional reportable segments. In 2023, the Allianz Group had 11 reportable segments.\n\n### **Allianz Group structure – business segments and reportable segments[2](#page-52-2)**\n\n| Property-Casualty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Life/Health                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| - German Speaking Countries and<br>Central & Eastern Europe<br>- Western & Southern Europe,<br>Allianz Direct, and Allianz<br>Partners<br>- Asia Pacific<br>- Global Insurance Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia & Latin America,<br>Middle East, and Africa | - German Speaking Countries and<br>Central & Eastern Europe<br>- Western & Southern Europe<br>- Asia Pacific<br>- USA<br>- Global Insurance Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia & Latin America,<br>Middle East, and Africa |\n| Asset Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Corporate and Other                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| - Asset Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Corporate and Other                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Insurance operations\n\nWe offer a wide range of property-casualty and life/health insurance products to both retail and corporate customers.

Notwithstanding this overall responsibility, the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.\n\nDivisional responsibilities for business segments and/or functional responsibilities are assigned to the individual departments. The latter include Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Mergers & Acquisitions. Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities in more detail.\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer t[o Mandates of the Members of the](#page-12-0)  [Board of Management.](#page-12-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare threeyear plans, which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. On the basis of this plan, the Supervisory Board sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remuneration structure, including target setting and performance assessment, please refer to th[e Remuneration Report.](#page-25-0)\n\nWe continuously monitor our business performance against these targets through monthly reviews – which cover key operational and financial metrics – to ensure we can move quickly and take <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group uses operating profit and core net income as key financial performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, core return on equity[1](#page-54-0) and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management. For a comprehensive overview of our business segment performance, please refer to the respective chapters on the following pages.\n\nBesides performance steering, we also have a risk-steering process in place, which is described in the [Risk and Opportunity](#page-129-0)  [Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) too, are taken into account when determining the variable remuneration of the Board of Management. Non-financial KPIs include customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction as well as various environmental indicators. For further information on non-financial KPIs, as well as an overview of the development and expected development of these non-financial KPIs, please refer to th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n# About the statement\n\nThis section has been compiled in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Directive Implementation Act (EU Directive 2014/95/EU), which has been transposed into German law via §§ 315d, 289f HGB.\n\nAllianz will be required to report under the new sustainability reporting regime of Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in its sustainability statement for financial year 2024. We are moving towards compliance with the CSRD with our financial year 2023 reporting for \"Climate change\" (European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) E1) and \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1), in terms of anticipating structural and many content requirements of CSRD. All material topics will be covered as per the CSRD as of financial year 2024 reporting. Going forward, the focus for Allianz will shift from reporting in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) towards full CSRD compliance for financial year 2024.\n\nThe topics \"Climate change\" and \"Own workforce\" are strategic sustainability focus areas at the Allianz Group, supported by our 2021 GRI materiality assessment and confirmed by the 2023 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) materiality assessment.\n\nThe concepts and key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect our material sustainability matters, based on the 2021 GRI materiality assessment, have been prepared in accordance with the latest GRI standards. For further information on our materiality assessment, please refer to section \"06.6\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThis non-financial chapter of our 2023 Annual Report covers the entire Allianz Group. All measures, activities, and key figures refer to the 2023 financial year (1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023). For targets relevant for the remuneration of the Board of Management, we disclose the targets that were set for this year, the achievements from this year and the targets for next year. For all other topics, we present the objectives and actions taken in the reporting year. Unless otherwise stated, we use the control principle defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when determining the scope of reporting for the Allianz Group. This Non-Financial Statement is an integral part of the management report and is subject to statutory audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.\n\nAny references to information published outside the Group Management Report and Allianz SE's Management Report are supplementary, do not form an integral part of this non-financial information, and are not subject to any assurance engagement (unless specified in the respective document).\n\nThe governance process for non-financial reporting is aligned with financial reporting and follows the same review principles as the Annual Report, engaging with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement has the following main chapters:\n\n- − Company description\n- − Corporate sustainability governance and strategy,\n- − Environmental matters,\n- − Social matters,\n- − Responsible consumer/sales,\n- − Cybersecurity,\n- − Human rights matters,\n- − Employee matters,\n- − Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters,\n- − EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- − Outlook.\n\n## <span id=\"page-55-1\"></span>Company description\n\nThe Allianz Group is one of the world's leading insurers and asset managers with around 125 million private and corporate customers[1](#page-55-1) in almost 70 countries.\n\nOur customers benefit from a broad range of personal and corporate insurance services. This includes property, life and health insurance, assistance services, credit insurance, and global business insurance.\n\nAs one of the world's largest investors, Allianz manages around € 737 bn on behalf of its insurance customers. Our asset managers – PIMCO and Allianz Global Investors – manage € 1.7 tn of third-party assets.\n\nFor further information on our business model, see our [Business](#page-52-0)  [Operations](#page-52-0) chapter in the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2023 and section \"01.2\" of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n# Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\n\nOur purpose – We secure your future – guides our actions across the Allianz Group and drives us to pursue constant innovation and collaboration. It also guides our interactions with our customers, partners, employees, investors, governments, regulators, society, people with disabilities and next generations across all our businesses.\n\nOur ambition is to support the transformation towards sustainable economies as a partner to our stakeholders. In doing so, we want to drive real-world impact across societies, economies, and the environment. This includes helping to shape the economy to provide the social minimum for all while maintaining environmental barriers.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are dedicated to responsible and transparent governance. Allianz has increased the importance of sustainability with the ambition to fully integrate sustainability across the company. Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. To support the Board of Management in its decision-making, Allianz SE established a dedicated Group Sustainability Board. It is composed of members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads, and meets quarterly. The core objectives of the Group Sustainability Board are: preparing the overall framework for sustainability for the Allianz Group, integrating sustainability into the Group's business processes with Allianz as an organization (operations and organization) and Allianz as a financial institution (investments, insurance, asset management), and maintaining oversight of and steering overarching sustainability matters.\n\nAllianz established a Sustainability Committee (as a committee of the Supervisory Board) to strengthen the integration and implementation of our sustainability strategy throughout the organization and business functions.\n\nThe core objectives of the Sustainability Committee include: advising the Supervisory Board on sustainability-related issues to support economically sound and sustainable development and positioning of the Allianz Group, closely monitoring and supporting oversight of the Management Board's sustainability strategy, in particular the management and execution of the strategic framework for group-wide sustainability measures and conducting preliminary examination of the sustainability-related disclosures, including the non-financial statement as part of the Supervisory Board's review. It also supports the Personnel Committee in the preparation of the sustainability-related target setting, as well as the review of the set targets' fulfillment for the Management Board's remuneration. In 2023, the Sustainability Committee prepared the recommendation of the sustainability-related targets for the members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE, reviewed the respective achievements of the Board of Management, and gave its recommendation to the Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Sustainability Committee was kept informed on the sustainability strategy and provided advice and guidance on critical issues.\n\nGlobal Sustainability was established in 2021 and supports the Group Sustainability Board in the execution of its responsibilities. This includes preparation, coordination, and implementation of the decisions by the Group Sustainability Board. It supports Allianz's Group Centers and operating entities to effectively integrate the Group's sustainability strategy into their business processes and policy framework. Global Sustainability drives the integration of sustainability-related matters across the organization and business to ensure Allianz plays a role in shaping the societies and economies in which it operates.\n\nGroup Centers take responsibility for sustainability within their functions with the purpose of embedding sustainability across the Allianz organization and business. Global Sustainability and Group Centers work with an extensive network of sustainability and business experts located across Allianz's operating entities, globally providing guidance and setting minimum standards to ensure they embed sustainability in their strategies and approaches. This network supports implementation of the group-wide sustainability strategy, shares best practice and scales positive impacts across the organization.\n\nOther Board of Management committees play an important role in decision-making processes:\n\n- − The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk.\n- − The Group Underwriting Committee monitors the underwriting business, its risk management and development of underwriting policies and strategies. This includes the integration of sustainability into these processes and strategies.\n- − The Group Investment Committee focuses on fundamental investment-related topics, including sustainability-related matters.\n\nWhile many operating entities (OEs) had already established local responsibilities for sustainability integration, this was formalized during 2023 with mandatory roles. Each OE must nominate one Board member to be responsible for sustainability, who will be supported by at least one Sustainability Lead.\n\nIn 2023 and for 2024, the targets for the Board of Management have been further developed to reflect sustainability priorities. The table below describes the targets in more detail. Minor wording changes were applied compared to the publications last year to create consistency with the Allianz SE Board Member target letters. The underlying targets remain unchanged compared to last year.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sustainability-related targets linked to the remuneration of the Board

To this end and to stay abreast of the trends that are most relevant to our stakeholders and our business, as well as to align our sustainability strategy, implementation measures, and reporting, we assess the materiality of sustainability matters on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2023, we carried out a robust and comprehensive double materiality assessment process (in accordance with the CSRD) and accompanying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)[1](#page-58-0), accounting for the evolving methodology to cover financial materiality (risks and opportunities from a business perspective) and impact materiality (impacts on people and planet). This has allowed us to deepen our understanding of matters previously identified as being material to our key stakeholders. It also enabled us to extend our assessment to those sustainability matters that have not been focus areas so far, but are now moving more into focus, as data, methodologies, and overall research and regulatory guidance evolve. The process, methodology, and outcome of the double materiality assessment were thoroughly reviewed and endorsed by our Group Sustainability Board and the Board of Management. In addition, Board of Management approval has been granted via the Allianz Group Annual Report sign-off process.\n\nThe CSRD double materiality assessment (CSRD DMA) will form the basis of our future reporting and will be reviewed annually. It has also been used to test our 2021 materiality assessment, which was based on the GRI Standards. This GRI materiality assessment, which identified 19 material issues, is still applicable. Topics were ranked and presented in a materiality matrix based on key stakeholder views on their importance to society and our business. The highest-ranked topics under the GRI materiality assessment were:\n\n- − Climate change,\n- − Ethics and responsible business,\n- − Cybersecurity.\n\nFor further details on the GRI materiality assessment, please refer to the \"06.6\" section in the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe CSRD DMA confirms the relevance of the previously identified topics. In addition, it forms the basis for introducing further topics to our sustainability reporting going forward, primarily from more broadly looking into impacts in the value chain. Regarding sustainability-related risks, the CSRD DMA does not identify additional principal risks with expected significant adverse impacts on Allianz (as according to the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). For further information on (potential) sustainability-related risks, please refer to the section \"Outlook\".\n\nWhile taxation is not covered under CSRD, it remains a relevant topic for Allianz in 2023 under the NFRD and is reported based on GRI 207-Tax. The respective information can be found in the section \"04.5\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)** as well as in our Group Tax Strategy published separately on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_TTR_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Partnerships also remain a relevant topic; going forward, respective details will be covered under the CSRD topic to which a partnership relates.\n\nThe topics \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) and \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1) are strategic sustainability focus areas at the Allianz Group, supported by the GRI materiality assessment and confirmed by the CSRD DMA. As such, we chose to already converge towards the CSRD with our financial year 2023 reporting for these two topics, in terms of anticipating its structural and many of its content requirements. For all material matters, disclosures in accordance with the topical ESRS and the cross-cutting ESRS will be fully covered as per the CSRD as of financial year 2024 reporting. As at financial year-end 2023, the stakeholder engagement process was still ongoing, so that reporting on this process and reflection of the results will be introduced next year.\n\nFor a description of the CSRD DMA process and outcome for the financial year 2023, please refer to the section \"Outlook\".\n\nOur purpose drives our sustainability priorities. This means supporting the transformation of economies that do not breach environmental barriers. It also means aspiring to achieve a social minimum for everyone. Building on our business strategy, we have set sustainability priorities that reflect our values and the areas where we think we can make an impact across Environment, Social, and Governance (E, S, and G).\n\nWe prioritize three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the integration of sustainability across Allianz and help us to contribute to societal, environmental, and economic change. In addition to SDG 13, Climate action, we have chosen SDG 8, Decent work and economic growth, to guide our work. We believe that delivering the sustainability agenda is only possible if stakeholders work together. This is why we also prioritize SDG 17, Partnership for the goals.\n\nEnvironment: our priority is Climate action/SDG 13. Our businesses spanning insurance, investment, and asset management are focused on understanding and shaping the climate transformation.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_It should be noted that the national transposition of the CSRD is still outstanding. The materiality assessment conducted for the financial year 2023 and described in this section and the Outlook section is based on the guidance from the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) available as\n\nat December 2023. In the event of changes to the CSRD upon becoming national law, those changes will be reflected in next year's reporting.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nSocial: our priority is Decent work and economic growth/SDG 8, including education upskilling and employability. We want to be a partner to our stakeholders, among them customers, governments, regulators, and societies. Our goal is to support the next generations and persons with disabilities so that they can access high-quality employment. Investing in learning and development for our diverse workforce is key to making all of this happen in a changing world of work.\n\nGovernance: our priority is to create trust through strong leadership. We aspire to be a trusted partner for protecting and growing our stakeholders' most valuable assets. Against that background, strong leadership is a key contributor to a company's culture and governance.\n\nIn everything we do across our priorities of E, S, and G, we strive to embed the sustainability principles and activities that are outlined in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nWe ground our strategy in proactive risk management to detect and address risks across the businesses. Group Risk is responsible for this process. We have not identified any remaining principal risks resulting from our operations, business activities, and business relations that could have severe adverse effects on material non-financial matters. Any potential risks and impacts identified throughout our risk assessment have been addressed by the respective concepts we have in place, which we describe in this report.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding sustainability issues allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities in underwriting, claims, proprietary investment management, and asset management. For further information on climate-related risks, please refer to the [Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0) Our concepts for all other matters for which reporting is required will be addressed in subsequent sections. The ESG approach provides part of the foundation for these concepts and is managed by Global Sustainability.\n\nWe continue to expand and strengthen our sustainability risk management framework. Understanding the requirements and limitations of our operating entities helps us to develop global sustainability processes that can be integrated into local processes and systems.\n\nOur commitment to tackling sustainability topics applies to our own operations and our insurance, investment, and asset management activities.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding and addressing sustainability issues helps us to reduce risks and capitalize on impacts and opportunities in all areas of our business.\n\nAs well as managing risks, sustainability integration directs us to create products and services that add value to society. We collaborate with clients and investee companies to deliver real-world benefits, and channel capital flows towards sustainable outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\n### **Sustainability opportunities and risks**\n\nAs an insurance company that manages risks ranging from single events to decades, it is important for Allianz to make a holistic assessment of risk.  \n\nIn the Allianz Group Risk Policy, we define sustainability risks as events or conditions that could have significant negative impacts on the assets, liabilities, profitability, or reputation of the Allianz Group or one of its companies. Examples include environmental and climate change risks, human rights violations, risks to local communities, and workforce risks.\n\nIf sustainability risks are not identified and managed effectively, they can have significant repercussions for Allianz and our customers, suppliers, investee companies and other stakeholders These repercussions include impacts on our reputation, supply chains, business continuity, quality, operations, and finances.  \n\nBy screening insurance, investment, and asset management projects from a sustainability perspective, we extend our understanding of risks and can exploit potential business opportunities to benefit shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders.  \n\n### **Our group-wide rules and processes**\n\nOur group-wide corporate rules and sustainability processes apply to all relevant underwriting, proprietary investment, and operations activities. They require strong collaboration between relevant functions and business areas.  \n\nKey processes are included in the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments. A new corporate rule, the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS), captures and updates some of the sustainability components of the AS RRIM in effect from 1 January 2024.  \n\nThe publicly available Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework provides transparency around our sustainability-related processes and guidelines. We published the fifth version of the Framework in 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**.\n\nOur asset management units have developed processes, rules, and governance for integrating sustainability into their investment activities.\n\nConsistent application of sustainability processes in our own business operations, insurance, and proprietary investment activities is crucial to mitigate risks and exploit the opportunities from the transition to a sustainable economy and society. It is also essential to our transformation into a sustainable financial service provider.\n\n### **Regulation as a driver of sustainability integration**\n\nWe welcome sustainability regulation as a major driver for fair competition and a level playing field.  We believe that sound regulation can improve the structure and clarity of sustainability information.\n\nIn 2023, we also actively engaged in and supported regulatory developments. For example, we are a member of the European Commission's Platform on Sustainable Finance and have contributed to the work of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) on EU sustainability reporting standards. Until April 2022, we did this via in-kind membership of the Project Task Force on European Sustainability Reporting Standards (PTF-ESRS). Since May 2022, when the new EFRAG governance was set up, our contribution has been via an in-kind membership representing the EU insurance industry in the Sustainability Reporting Technical Expert Group (SR TEG).\n\nIn this context, Allianz aims to contribute expert input with respect to the insurance industry, such as on the dual role of insurers as preparers and users of sustainability information, as well as on existing interconnected regulation.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe aim to leverage regulation on sustainability by ensuring consistent implementation across all Allianz businesses. At the same time, we aim to build business opportunities in line with regulatory concepts.\n\nAllianz has established a Sustainable Finance Regulation implementation project at Group level to drive this. Internal guidance is designed in close interaction with Group Centers and Operating Entities, to ensure consistent interpretation and implementation. The focus in 2023 was on the implementation of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), namely regarding pre-contractual and periodic product disclosure as well as website disclosure in consideration of \"Principal Adverse Impact\" for the Life-Asset product offering.\n\nIn 2023, Allianz started convergence into future CSRD reporting with a respective implementation project. The project is managed by the Group Accounting and Reporting function and defines policies, processes and reporting content in line with future ESRS requirements. The Group Sustainability Board oversees progress and deliverables of the project and provides directional guidance. The CSRD project is underpinned by the ambition to implement ESRS requirements with the same quality and diligence as for financial reporting processes.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nHuman-made climate change, one of the greatest global challenges of our time, has already caused far-reaching negative consequences and losses for nature and people. Various human and natural systems are being stressed beyond the limits of their adaptive capacity. Therefore, irreversible damage has already started to occur.\n\nIn order to mitigate these developments, the 2015 Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C by the end of the century. This has resulted in a fixed greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) budget; i.e., an upper limit for global emissions that may still be released. Based on modeled emission pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) **[6th](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)  [Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)**, emissions need to be almost halved every decade to restrict warming to 1.5 °C with limited or no overshoot, with a 50% probability of success. This would allow carbon (CO2) emissions to reach net-zero by 2050, meaning that residual emissions would be balanced by atmospheric carbon removal. Climate scientists estimate that halting GHG emissions on a net level would subsequently put a stop to further warming.\n\nIn 2022, however, annual energy-related carbon emissions reached a record level of 37 billion tons according to the **[International](https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-as-clean-energy-growth-offset-much-of-the-impact-of-greater-coal-and-oil-use)  [Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-as-clean-energy-growth-offset-much-of-the-impact-of-greater-coal-and-oil-use)**. If current trends continue, the GHG budget will be exceeded way before 2030 and the target of 1.5 °C will be overshot significantly. This increases the need for an even more rapid transition later on, as well as the use of atmospheric carbon removal – i.e., negative emission solutions – to bring warming back to 1.5 °C by the end of this century. **[Recent research](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach)** has shown this is still possible but requires urgent action by companies and policymakers alike.\n\nOur approach to climate change is grounded in the Allianz Group Climate Change Strategy. First published in 2005, it steers our response to climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities in our insurance and investment business. Since 2015, the Climate Change Strategy has been built around our efforts to anticipate climate risks, care for our customers, and enable the net-zero transition.\n\nSince 2018, our Climate Change Strategy has committed us to contribute to pursuing efforts that limit global warming to 1.5 °C by the end of thecentury. To anticipate and enable this transition, Allianz has committed to net-zero greenhouse gases (GHG) for our proprietary investments, Property-Casualty insurance, and our own operations. In September 2023, we published our Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Inaugural-Net-Zero-Transition-Plan.pdf)**, which describes our intermediary targets for 2030 and key actions to achieve them. This approach builds on the previously released 2025 emissions targets for proprietary investments and own operations.\n\nOur priorities include quantitative emission targets, strategic growth of financing and insuring of low-carbon technologies that support net-zero, targeted restrictions for fossil fuel-based business models to manage transition risks, and a systemic approach to investee engagement and policy advocacy, supported by climate action in our own operations.\n\nThese elements, which address the impacts, risks, and opportunities of climate change, are explained in more detail in the subsequent sections on insurance, investments, own operations, and risks. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition toward net-zero.\n\nSince the net-zero transition is a systemic issue, it requires a wholeof-society response. Therefore, we are also seeking to join forces with other stakeholders. Our approach on the investment side builds on the work of the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which Allianz co-founded and currently chairs. Furthermore, we encourage companies to implement net-zero strategies via our participation in The B Team, Climate Action 100+, the Transition Pathway Initiative, and the Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nFor further information and a full list of sustainability related memberships, please refer to the section \"06.3\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website.](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**\n\n### **Climate-related opportunities**\n\nOur materiality analysis under CSRD found climate-related opportunities to be material for the Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments. Our business strategy and our net-zero transition plan aim to systematically leverage opportunities to finance and insure a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nWe have strategically insured and invested in low-carbon assets for over a decade. With our 2023 Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan, we have also set quantitative targets for investing and insuring solutions that are needed in the net-zero transition. Our Sustainable Solutions program provides products and services that aim to create positive impacts with our (re-)insurance activities and investments. Growing sustainable solutions is among the topics included in the annual financial planning processes of our operating entities, in order to systematically identify growth and profitability potential. For further information on sustainable solutions, please refer to the section EU Taxonomy for non-life insurance.\n\nWe believe our intermediate climate targets will help us realize growth potential. For commercial insurance in particular, our transition plan includes a target to achieve 150% profitable growth in revenues from renewable energy and low-carbon technology solutions by 2030.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Climate policy dialogue**\n\nWe can achieve our targets only jointly with public policy and the real economy, as the necessary changes require broad support. For instance, sufficient frameworks and market incentives are required to bring down demand for emission-intensive products and to allocate capital in line with a 1.5 °C trajectory. The private sector, including insurers, can play an important role in raising awareness and making the business case for getting on track to limit global warming. To that end, we also work with policymakers and regulators to support sustainable financing and achieve the goals laid down in the Paris Agreement. We are advocating for global effective climate policy which should achieve the following:\n\n- − Embedding \"net-zero by 2050\" in short and long-term governmental climate targets, climate strategies, and emissions reduction plans, following the latest climate science in line with pathways of no or low overshoot of a 1.5 °C temperature rise.\n- − Developing sector policies to promote a swift and socially fair transition, including the development of more granular short-, medium- and long-term net-zero infrastructure plans.\n- − Implementing stringent carbon pricing to internalize the external costs of pollution, including a phase-out of direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies.\n- − Protecting nature and supporting regenerative forestry and agriculture. Supporting and redirecting fossil fuel-related subsidies to scale up new technologies that will provide solutions in hard-toabate sectors, e.g., carbon capture and storage, and green hydrogen.\n- − Promoting mandatory assured climate disclosure, including transition plans, GHG emissions, associated reduction targets, and alignment with 1.5 °C trajectories, ideally aligned internationally.\n- − Ensuring sustainable finance regulation that provides a defined, science-based, and reliable framework via a common taxonomy of sustainability, clarification of asset managers' duties, inclusion of sustainability in prudential regulation, and enhanced transparency of corporate reporting.\n\n### **1.5 °C alignment of targets**\n\nOur emission targets are aligned with credible, science-backed climate scenarios – such as those provided by the IPCC[1](#page-61-0) – that limit global warming in 2100 to 1.5 °C with only a limited or no overshoot of this temperature during this century. While the individual scenarios differ in their assumptions and narratives, they agree on a necessary emission reduction range for CO2 emissions of 36% to 69% from 2020 to 2030, with a median reduction of 48%.[2](#page-61-0) All our existing sub-portfolio targets with a global focus are in line with this. For our motor retail portfolio, the targeted reductions, which apply to nine European markets, are aligned with respective net-zero pathways.[3](#page-61-1)\n\nOur target year 2030 is defined as year-end 2029. Our base years for the 2030 targets in proprietary investments and operations continue to be the base year 2019 (building on existing 2025 targets). This also allows us to filter out the temporary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach taken for our P&C insurance targets was to focus on the most recent year for which data was available, this being 2022.\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\nFor our portfolio targets, there are generally two levers for decarbonization, that is reducing GHG emissions: either our portfolio companies – i.e., the customers we insure or the companies we invest in – reduce their GHG emissions, or we change the composition of our portfolio over time.\n\nThe former relies directly on GHG emission reductions in the real economy, which is not under our control. The latter can also occur naturally as part of typical insurance and investment business cycles in different lines of business, sectors, and individual customers, and is generally more under our control.\n\nWe aim to achieve GHG emission reductions through actions such as engaging customers, increasing exposures to lower-carbon business, and setting targets for lower-carbon technologies, as well as reducing our exposure to defined fossil-fuel business such as thermal coal. For our own operational GHG emissions, the main levers for reduction are Electricity, Buildings as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement. These elements are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\nWe apply both absolute and intensity GHG emission targets. Absolute GHG emissions refer to an absolute amount of GHG emissions associated with the respective business activity such as\n\n3\\_Target applies to the most relevant markets for Allianz, where adequate and reliable data is available.\n\n2\\_For GHG emissions, the range is 34 to 60, with a median of 43.\n\n<span id=\"page-61-1\"></span><span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>investing or insuring; absolute GHG emission targets seek to reduce the absolute amount of GHG emissions. GHG emission intensity and associated targets, on the other hand, harmonize the GHG emissions through a denominator that relates to a business activity. For example, GHG emissions per million invested or per million of premium.\n\n### **Property-Casualty insurance**\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our commercial portfolio will be reduced as we continue the planned implementation of our underwriting guidelines for coal as well as for oil and gas in line with announced thresholds and timelines. Our portfolio will also change as we continue to expand our risk appetite in the segment of renewable energy, low-carbon, and transition technologies. We will also benefit from GHG emission reductions in the real economy that our corporate customers pursue as part of their own net-zero strategies as required by governments, investors, and other stakeholders, and in addition, enabled by us as an insurer. A supportive policy environment is crucial here and is an important lever both for the net-zero transition in the global economy and for our target achievement.\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our motor retail portfolio are planned to be reduced through various initiatives; firstly, by increasing our share of battery electric vehicles for our markets in scope. It is also clear from **[market research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves)** that customers want to drive less, so we will encourage sustainable behaviors by providing offerings that reward these lifestyle changes. Another key lever will therefore be providing further incentives for reducing GHG emissions via mileage-based product offerings. When considering potential initiatives we took into account future projections in each of the countries for which we have set targets, including energy usage, vehicle usage and vehicle types. Our incentives will therefore balance the improvements we expect to see in the respective markets with Allianz actions aimed at closing the gap to our stated targets. We will therefore actively steer our in-scope portfolios to be more sustainable whilst benefiting from changes we predict to observe in market behavior.\n\nWe will also engage with customers to support their transition to electric mobility and meet their changing needs. We are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for battery electric vehicles and the related ecosystem, and to supporting our customers in transitioning to new forms of mobility.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_6th Assessment Report. Further scenarios used include the IEA's Net-Zero by 2050 and the One Earth Climate Model.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Proprietary investment**\n\nOur investment management function allows us to influence our portfolio allocation by setting targets and frameworks for our asset managers. These include defining concrete decarbonization targets for individual mandates, excluding certain high-emitting companies without reduction plans, and increasing target volumes for investments in climate solutions.\n\nIn order to achieve GHG emission reductions in the companies in our portfolio, we cultivate all types of engagement: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager engagement. As part of our multilateral engagement activities, the transition of whole sectors is a particular focus.\n\n### **Own operations**\n\nAs the specific definition of net-zero is still evolving for financial institutions and we anticipate CSRD requirements, we are no longer referring to the 2030 target for our Own Operations as a net-zero commitment. We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target. The rest of the decarbonization and removal targets for Own Operations remain as communicated in the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBy 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (for further information, please refer to the section \"Own Operations\"). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for year-end 2029, 65%[1](#page-62-0) versus a 2019 baseline.\n\nTo address the remaining 30%[2](#page-62-0) of the emissions we will use highquality carbon removal solutions.\n\nKey levers for GHG emission reduction will be the areas of Renewable Electricity, Buildings, as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement. In the area of Renewable Electricity, we source 100% renewable electricity from 2023 onwards and implement energy efficiency measures.[3](#page-62-0) For Buildings, we have developed a Buildings Standards Catalogue that includes various measures addressing GHG emission reduction. For Fleet and Business Travel, we aim to shift to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the latest, achieve a 40% reduction of GHG emissions from travel activities by 2025 compared to a 2019 baseline, and purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to address GHG emissions from air travel. For Procurement, we will ask 100% of global framework vendors in our supply chain that provide services globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 °C path by 2025.\n\n### **Carbon removal and carbon credits**\n\nIn the past reporting year, we did not use carbon removal and associated carbon credits when accounting for our GHG and the associated reduction targets. Our net-zero targets will likely require the use of atmospheric carbon removal in the respective net-zero targets year. For this, we expect to only use high-quality carbon removal. Our focus remains on GHG emission reductions.\n\n### **Governance**\n\nUltimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability, including climate, resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. This includes climate change and the net-zero transition plan, which has been approved by the Board of Management. Climate-related matters are typically part of all Group Sustainability Board meetings, which are held at least quarterly. For further information, please refer to the section \"Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\".\n\nOur Climate Change Strategy is rooted in the established sustainability governance (for further information, please refer to the section \"Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\") and its associated policies on sustainability, climate, and the energy sector. For further information, please refer to the section \"Overarching Policies\".\n\n### **Progress**\n\nIn the following sections on insurance, investments, and operations, we report on the details and progress of the implementation of the transition plan.\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>The Allianz sustainability approach integrates climate and sustainability-related considerations by applying group-wide corporate rules and sustainability instruments across underwriting and investment activities. Key processes include the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules, such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU) and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI).\n\nThe AS RRIM has been in place since 2013 and establishes a core set of principles and processes for the management of reputational risks and sustainability issues within the Group. It is owned by Group Risk, authorized by the Group Finance and Risk Committee and acknowledged by the Allianz SE Board of Management. The objective of the Standard is to proactively identify business decisions and business activities with the potential to trigger reputational issues and, where appropriate, take action to minimize their probability and/or impact. This Standard is mandatory for all operating entities of the Allianz Group. For 2024, the intention is for it to be superseded by the Allianz Standard for Communications and the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, Allianz has four energy-related guidelines in place: **[thermal coal](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-coal-based-business-models.pdf)**, **[oil sands](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-oil-sands-based-business-models.pdf)**, **[oil & gas](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-oil-gas-business-models.pdf)**, and **[renewable/low-carbon energy](file://WWG00M.ROOTDOM.NET/DFS/HOME/N6BED3Q/ICM/Downloads/Allianz%20Statement%20on%20renewable%20/%20low-carbon%20energy)**. The guidelines are owned by Global Sustainability and authorized by the Allianz SE Board of Management. They apply to proprietary investments and P&C insurance, including facultative reinsurance. Their common goals are to contribute to the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy technologies, to manage sustainability and reputational risks, and to achieve our net-zero related targets. The three fossil fuel guidelines define business practices and business models where we do not provide further services or investments along defined technical exclusion criteria. They typically differentiate between single-site restrictions – which apply to stand-alone P&C covers as well as direct project investments – and restrictions on company-level exposures. Purely to support renewable and lowcarbon technologies, we allow ring-fenced coverages of and investments into projects and subsidiaries of companies that are otherwise restricted due to the fossil-related energy guidelines. This is described in the Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline. The guidelines were introduced in 2015 (thermal coal), 2021 (oil sands), 2022 (oil & gas), and 2023 (renewable/low-carbon) respectively.\n\n2\\_Remaining 30 % means, that if we achieve 70 % reduction by year-end 2030, we will remove 30 %. If the reduction target is overachieved, then we remove the remaining gap to 100 %.\n\n3\\_For more details about the sources of the renewable electricity, please refer to section \"Energy and consumption mix\".\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs in previous years, we report on the exemptions granted based on the rules outlined in the guideline to companies breaching thermal coal thresholds. In 2023, we received two coal-related requests from our operating entities to exempt corporate clients from companybased restrictions related to both P&C insurance and proprietary investment segments. Of these, one was granted and one was not granted. The granted one was a 1.5 °C exemption, which means that the company was assessed to be on a 1.5 °C pathway despite its coal exposure. The option to grant a grace period of one year for companies aligned with well below 2 °C was granted four times in 2022. As of January 2023, this was no longer possible as per the guideline's rules. The requirement to refer business for so-called green exemptions – i.e., permission to underwrite or invest in renewable energy projects of companies restricted based on the coal guideline, for example – was removed in February 2023 when the new Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline was published. As a result, there is no further reporting on those exemptions.\n\nThe publicly available 5th version of the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework (formerly the ESG Integration Framework) on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**, lays out these main internal policies and processes related to our overarching sustainability risk approach.\n\nThe subsequent sections will outline specific policies applicable to proprietary investments and insurance.\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nAccording to the GHG protocol, reporting on emissions associated with insurance underwriting activities is optional. In our motor retail and commercial insurance portfolios, we have made important progress in measuring insurance-associated emissions and we set inaugural emission reduction targets in 2023. For these targets, we follow the methodology of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard.[1](#page-63-0)\n\nAccording to the standard, insurance-associated emissions (IAE) for commercial lines are calculated by multiplying an attribution factor (i.e., for commercial lines this is the insurance premium divided by insured customer's revenue) by the absolute GHG emissions of the re/insured customer or asset. The attribution factor determines what share of the absolute emissions of an insured customer or asset is attributable to re/insurance.\n\nFor the portfolio in scope of the emission reduction target for commercial insurance, the baseline insurance-associated emissions in 2022 was 1.00 mn t CO2e and the insurance-associated emission intensity was 0.26 kt CO2e/€ mn GWP.[2](#page-63-0) Given the lack of reliable and comparable data on customer Scope 3 emissions, our commercial baseline currently only covers our customers' Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\nFor motor retail, the calculation considers the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of insured vehicles within a portfolio and multiplies them by an attribution factor. The attribution factor represents the insurance industry's share of the total cost of ownership of a vehicle, which includes other costs such as depreciation, fuel, and maintenance. The carbon emissions of the insured vehicles are multiplied by the industry attribution factor (calculated by PCAF as 6.99 % for 2023) to calculate the insurance-associated emissions.\n\nFor the motor retail portfolios covered by the emission reduction target, the baseline for absolute insurance-associated emissions in 2022 was 2.10 mn t CO2[3](#page-63-1) (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) in line with the PCAF standard.\n\n### **Overall GHG emission reduction target**\n\nFor commercial insurance, we are setting an intensity target for the sub-portfolio of large companies in all sectors, which is managed by Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty. We are focusing on those companies for which GHG emission data is available. For the 2022 baseline, this cohort represented 13 % of the premiums in the commercial segment for which emission accounting methodologies are currently available.[4](#page-63-2) Our target is to reduce the emission intensity of this sub-portfolio by 45 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline (see table \"2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions\").\n\nOur target of a 45 % emission intensity reduction for this subportfolio refers to emission intensity as the main KPI and not to the absolute insurance-associated emissions (in tonnes of CO2e). Emission intensity shows the volume of customer-generated emissions associated with every € 1 million of premium we write (tonnes <span id=\"page-63-2\"></span><span id=\"page-63-1\"></span><span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>CO2e/million EUR). While defining an intensity target allows us to reflect the expected growth of our portfolio by 2030 in a dynamic way, our targeted reduction is still within the scenario range of necessary absolute reduction to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. For further information, please refer to section \"Transition Plan & Strategy\". In addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) of the International Energy Agency.\n\nOur first intermediary target for commercial lines targets the subportfolio with the largest climate impact and adequate GHG data quality. This will allow us to steer our portfolio and measure our progress based on reasonable and verifiable GHG emission data, rather than overly relying on sector estimates.\n\nFor retail insurance, we are setting a target to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our motor retail portfolio. For the motor retail portfolio, the target covers nine key European markets, namely: Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. Our target is to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 30 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline. Portfolios classified as in scope are aligned with the PCAF standard for personal motor.\n\nFor the 2022 baseline, the in-scope portfolios within these markets represent 55 % of the motor retail premiums. The target focuses on the most relevant motor markets for Allianz where the biggest impact can be made. This includes where there is adequate and reliable data available, in order for emissions to be measured and progress against our target to be accurately tracked.\n\nIn addition, our target setting is aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C and was informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using scenarios from external data partners.\n\n4\\_In line with Lines of Business currently covered by the PCAF Standard. Scope coverage is unchanged compared to the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan. Share of premiums related to GHG reduction target follows IFRS definition of gross written premiums and deviates from PCAF, which excludes external acquisition costs; following PCAF definition of insurance premiums, scope coverage represents roughly 16 % of the eligible premiums in the commercial segment. More details can be found in the explanatory notes.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_For further details on the methodology please refer to the explanatory notes on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)**. An exception to the application of the PCAF standard is made for the calculation of Insurance-Associated Emissions (IEAs) for insurance policies as defined in the Allianz Statement on renewable/ lowcarbon energy, as the standard does not yet specify accounting rules for the measurement of IEAs related to these types of assets.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions**\n\n|              | Unit of<br>targets  | Target<br>2030 | Baseline<br>2022 | Delta target<br>2030 vs<br>Baseline<br>2022 (%) |\n|--------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Commercial   | kt CO2e/€<br>mn GWP | 0.14           | 0.26             | (45.0)                                          |\n| Retail motor | mn t CO21           | 1.47           | 2.10             | (30.0)                                          |\n\n1\\_Motor retail target is CO2 emissions only, not CO2e, to be consistent with the data which is currently available.\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\n#### **Insured customers decarbonization**\n\nIn the commercial insurance business, our aim is to drive decarbonization across all industry sectors and partner with our customers on their net-zero journeys by leveraging collaboration, sustainability expertise, and best practice, as well as our influence as a major global insurance company.\n\nTo this end, we will proactively approach customers to foster dialogue and encourage a shift toward science-based net-zero strategies. Firstly, each year we will engage with the top 100 customers, selected by premium size and average industry sector emission intensity, who do not currently have an emissions reporting or a disclosure approach and are therefore currently not in scope for our emission reduction target. By taking this step, we are endeavoring to raise awareness for increased transparency and data exchange and ultimately aiming to close the GHG reporting gap in our portfolio. Secondly, we will engage with customers within the transportation industry – specifically aviation and marine – by leveraging bestpractice exchanges on decarbonization strategies for these sectors. Thirdly, we will seek dedicated exchanges with two to three companies per year on their net-zero strategies. For this engagement category, we will screen our portfolio to identify high-emitting companies who have not yet developed science-based net-zero strategies. Sustainability teams within AGCS will support in the selection of engagement candidates and prepare the engagement dialogues, which will be conducted jointly with the distribution and underwriting teams.\n\nFor motor retail insurance, we will also actively engage with our customers to encourage the transition to net-zero. We aim to engage with 20 million current and potential customers by 2030 to support their transition to electric mobility, mainly through Allianz-developed online platforms, newsletters and advertising. The 20 million target reflects the current and estimated future number of customers in the markets defined as in scope, who do not own a battery electric vehicle (BEV). Engagement will include focusing on the benefits of switching to electric mobility and the practicalities of doing so, for example home charging infrastructure and insurance options.\n\nTo increase our share of sustainably-minded customers, we will offer mileage-based products to reward customers who are actively seeking to reduce their emissions. Our aim in offering such solutions is to encourage change across the insurance sector in how we, as an industry, approach motor insurance.\n\nBy offering mileage-based products, we will ensure fair and riskadequate pricing for our customers that aligns with our technical excellence program. Increasing our market share of BEVs will enable us to collect more data and thus improve the accuracy of our risk models. We are committed to understanding the risks, gathering data, and being actively involved in research in order to ensure our net-zero plan invests in society to the benefit of all.\n\nTo support the implementation of our actions, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE will support engagement activities, which will be achieved in collaboration with OEs.\n\n#### **Portfolio steering**\n\nFurthermore, for commercial portfolios, we are committing to actively supporting the net-zero transition by fostering profitable growth and scaling up of renewable energy, low-carbon and other transition technologies that are a key element of the net-zero transformation. Concretely, we aim to profitably grow revenues in Property Damage (PD) and Business Interruption (BI) coverages related to these transition solutions[1](#page-64-0) by 150 % by 2030 compared to 2022.\n\nIn addition, we are applying the energy-related guidelines as laid out in the section \"Overarching Policies\". The focus on these highemitting sectors is an important lever and contributor to the targeted reduction of emissions intensity at portfolio level.\n\nRestricted companies are listed in the Global ESG Risk List, which is available to all underwriters globally. Training on the application of the policies is offered regularly to support underwriting teams with their implementation.\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>To ensure we deliver on our targets, we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities to allow for ownership of the topics and monitoring of progression toward completion. Although targets are stated as 2030, there are clear internal interim timelines and reporting processes that will allow for regular monitoring of progress.\n\nAdditionally, to support the implementation of our decarbonization strategy for commercial lines, we have set up two dedicated sustainability teams in the AGCS Chief Technical Office (CTO). The Sustainability Governance team oversees the implementation of portfolio strategy, target setting, monitoring, and reporting. The Sustainability Solutions team focuses on business growth and expansion in line with our \"insuring the transition\" actions. Both teams work closely together and support our distribution and underwriting teams. In addition, our Allianz Risk Consulting teams continue to provide expertise on emerging technology requirements and challenges.\n\nTo further support the transition to net-zero within our motor retail portfolio, we aim by 2030 to insure a larger percentage of BEVs in the Allianz portfolios compared to the share of BEVs in the respective inscope markets.\n\nTo enable this portfolio change, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for BEVs and the related ecosystem, in order to support our customers in transitioning to this new technology. Our ambition is to be a market leader for BEVs and we have implemented a mobility strategy in order to support this transition. This strategy is an ongoing project with key deliverables and drives our ambition to be a market leader through strategy development, global exchanges, monitoring, and reporting.\n\nA workstream within the technical area oversees the implementation of our mobility strategy. This workstream has a focus on technical leadership in electric vehicles, supporting our markets in the development and implementation of action plans to meet our targets, as well as ensuring the regular delivery and monitoring of key performance indicators. It also utilizes Allianz's global presence through regular exchanges with OEs as part of internal Mobility Smart Circle meetings and optimizing the pooling of mobility data across countries, leveraging the Group's expertise.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Transition solutions include the technologies mentioned in the Allianz Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Statement, as well as waste to energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS)/direct air capture, battery storage and grid-stability-related investments, smart grids and electrification, electric transportation, EV\n\nand battery manufacturing plants, electric mass transit infrastructure construction (rail), certified green buildings, industry projects related to energy transition (ammonia and bio-based/synthetic fuels), and green shipping. We have started working on harmonizing terminology and underlying eligible\n\ntechnologies related to the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions (currently used for P&C insurance). We expect to conclude this work and report on it in 2024 fiscal year.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditionally, to support the implementation of the overall decarbonization strategy for motor retail, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE oversees target and strategy development, portfolio steering, reporting and monitoring, data maintenance, and quality assurance.\n\n### **Insurance-specific policies**\n\nAll relevant aspects of our insurance portfolios are governed by the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU). Ownership and execution of the Standard sits with Global P&C and is governed by the Group Underwriting Committee (GUC). However, ultimate responsibility resides with the Allianz SE Board of Management. The ASU governs the rules and principles for P&C Underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture. Its rules and principles focus on underwriting sustainable and profitable business. The ASU includes our principles for sustainability and codifies roles and responsibilities within operating entities related to the decarbonization of underwriting portfolios.\n\nThe objectives of the Sustainable Insurance section of the ASU include: developing sustainable business opportunities, building resilience and anticipating future developments and adapting to them, safeguarding against reputational risks, and taking adequate corporate responsibility for our planet.\n\nThe ASU is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant internal stakeholders.\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nFor our proprietary investment portfolio, we are calculating financed GHG emissions according to PCAF guidance and expanding the methodology to asset classes not yet covered by PCAF. Although we aspire to calculate financed GHG emissions for as much of our portfolio as possible, we are constrained by the development of methodologies and availability of data. Nevertheless, we remain committed to progressively expanding the coverage of our portfolio over time.\n\nWe do not calculate financed GHG emissions for covered bonds, ABS/MBS and cash as there is no methodology available yet for these asset classes. To see these asset classes, please see lines \"no methodology\" in table \"Financed emissions\".\n\nWe calculate three types of financed GHG emissions defined by the underlying investment: 1) Corporates, which includes all investees with a balance sheet, i.e., – in PCAF terminology – listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, as well as project finance; 2) Real Estate, which includes commercial real estate loans and real estate equity investments; and 3) Public Debt, which includes sovereign debt, sub-sovereign debt, and supranational debt. As there is no specific PCAF guidance on carbon accounting for sub-sovereigns and supranationals, we have adapted the methodology for sovereign debt to these two asset classes. We do not cover 100 % of our exposure in these three types of financed GHG emissions (i.e., Corporates, Real Estate and Public Debt) due to the lack of relevant emission data information. To see this data coverage gap, please see column \"coverage\" in table \"Financed emissions\".\n\nFor a detailed description of our carbon accounting methodology, please refer to our explanatory notes on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Explanatory_Notes_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nIn 2023, our total financed GHG emissions were 57.3 mn t CO2e compared to 46.4 mn t CO2e in 2022 (see table \"Financed emissions\"). The increase was driven in particular by adding new asset classes like sub-sovereigns, supranationals, and infrastructure debt.\n\nOur total coverage of financed GHG emissions increased from 59.6 % to 62.1 %.\n\nThe table below shows the book value, financed GHG emissions, and coverage (i.e., percentage of book value for which financed GHG emissions are calculated) per carbon footprint methodology and is split into IFRS 9 asset classes.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\n### **Financed emissions**\n\n|                                                                                        | 2023                 |                                               |                                               |                 | 2022                 |                                               |                                               |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                                        | Book value<br>(€ bn) | Absolute financed<br>emissions<br>(mn t CO₂e) | Carbon intensity<br>(t CO₂e/€ mn<br>invested) | Coverage<br>(%) | Book value<br>(€ bn) | Absolute financed<br>emissions<br>(mn t CO₂e) | Carbon intensity<br>(t CO₂e/€ mn<br>invested) | Coverage<br>(%) |\n| Corporates                                                                             | 294.2                | 20.1                                          | 64.7                                          | 90.6            | 194.3                | 16.6                                          | 75.1                                          | -

Thus we in general follow the recommendations of the NZAOA for setting intermediate decarbonization targets. While the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol (NZAOA TSP) defines targets for engagements, sectors and financing the transition, we display these as actions in line with ESRS E1. The NZAOA TSP was aligned with all relevant stakeholders and vetted in a public consultation and was developed with a strong reference to the 1.5°C no/low overshoot climate scenarios in the latest report of the IPCC. For further information, please see section \"The scientific basis for establishing net-zero targets\" of the **[NZAOA TSP](https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AOA-Target-Setting-Protocol-Third-edition.pdf)**[1](#page-67-0) .\n\nWe have already reached our intermediate 2025 decarbonization target for corporate bonds and listed equities in 2023 as we reduced our financed GHG emissions by 44% against the target of a 25 % reduction. For full 2025 target reporting, please refer to the section \"03.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**. We have also reached our targets for engagements and financing the transition. For further information, please refer to the section \"Decarbonization Levers\".\n\nWe have therefore decided to update our complete range of targets in 2023 and define new targets for 2030. When setting these targets, we considered potential future developments in large industries, especially the E.U. and the U.S., based on the latest climate law and regulation; i.e., \"Fit for 55\" and the \"Inflation Reduction Act\". We also wanted our new targets to include what we have learned from previous years; e.g., related to data availability. The targets remain in line with the latest science (IPCC report) and industry best practice (NZAOA TSP) and are broader in terms of coverage and depth. For a detailed explanation of our 2030 targets, please refer to Explaining Allianz Intermediate Climate Target Setting 2030 for Proprietary Investments[2](#page-67-0) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Explaining-Allianz-Intermediate-Climate-Target-Setting-2030-for-Proprietary-Investments.pdf)**.\n\nAs of the financial year 2024, we will only report on our new 2030 targets.\n\n### **Overall GHG emission reduction target**\n\nWe have set an absolute GHG emission reduction target for listed corporates (corporate bonds and public equity). Our target is to reduce absolute GHG emissions in the respective asset classes by 50% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline emissions.\n\nWe have added a 2030 emission intensity reduction target covering all listed and unlisted corporate exposure (e.g., infrastructure debt) in the amount of 50% compared to the 2019 baseline emission intensity (see table \"2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments\").\n\nA reduction of 50% is in line with latest IPCC scenarios and equals the midpoint of the respective scenario range from 40 % to 60 %. For <span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>further information, please refer to section \"1.5 °C alignment of targets\" and the work of the NZAOA with the IPCC scenario[s3](https://www.unepfi.org/industries/target-setting-protocol-third-edition/) .\n\nFor unlisted corporates, we are still in the process of gathering emission data and we do not know beforehand how many of our portfolio companies and indirect investments via funds will deliver data in the coming years until 2030. As data coverage is uncertain and changing, we cannot set a reasonable absolute GHG emission reduction target for our overall corporate portfolio. An intensity metric does not rely on coverage as absolute GHG emissions are divided by the respective portfolio exposure. We therefore decided to set an emission intensity reduction target for our listed and unlisted corporates portfolio for 2030.\n\nWe have set 2030 targets that are aligned with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (**[CRREM](https://www.crrem.eu/)**) for our real estate equity and debt portfolios. These sectoral decarbonization pathways are based on the latest science, supported by the Science Based Targets initiative, and widely accepted as best practice.\n\nOur progress toward target achievement will be monitored regularly and reported in the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nThe table below shows Allianz intermediate 2030 decarbonization targets as well as the respective baseline year values, where available. We have defined GHG emission reduction targets for corporates and real estate.\n\n#### **2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments**\n\n|                                                              | Book value 2023<br>(€ bn) | % of total | Unit of targets         | Target 2030 | Current year 2023 | Baseline year 2019 | Delta Target 2030 vs<br>Baseline 2019 (%) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| All Corporates (Listed and Unlisted)                         | 294.2                     | 39.9       | t CO2e/€ mn<br>invested | 54.0        | 64.7              | 108.1              | (50.0)                                    |\n| thereof: Listed Corporates (Traded Equity / Corporate Bonds) | 192.2                     | 26.1       | mn t CO2e               | 12.5        | 14.0              | 24.9               | (50.0)                                    |\n| Real Estate (Equity and Debt)1,2,5                           | 110.6                     | 15.0       | kg CO2/m2               | ca. 25.0    | 33.5              | -                  | -                                         |\n| No methodology3                                              | 165.4                     | 22.4       | -                       | -           | -                 | -                  | -                                         |\n| No target yet4                                               | 166.6                     | 22.6       | mn t CO2e               | -           | 36.7              | -                  | -                                         |\n| Total                                                        | 736.8                     | 100.0      | -                       | -           | -                 | -                  | -                                         |\n\n1\\_Including 50 % of real estate funds and w/o retail mortgages.\n\n2\\_Including Pimco Prime Real Estate portfolio.\n\n3\\_This includes asset classes for which no methodology exists yet, e.g. covered bonds and cash.\n\n4\\_This includes asset classes for which we calculate owned emissions but have no targets yet, e.g. sovereign bonds.\n\n5\\_Target 2030: Exact target depends on regional and sectorial portfolio composition 12/2029.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Decarbonization levers**\n\n#### **Portfolio allocation change**\n\nThe scope of actions outlined below to implement portfolio allocation changes is in line with the scope of our overall GHG emission reduction targets; i.e., covering our global exposure in corporates and real estate.\n\nAs an investment management function, we have set targets and frameworks for our asset managers that will ultimately lead to a change in our portfolio allocation with respect to asset classes, investees, and sectors.\n\nAs we have set overall GHG reduction targets on a Group-wide level, we start by breaking down the global target to individual mandate level. Each asset manager is then responsible for reaching the respective mandate decarbonization target by taking appropriate actions. For real estate, for example, these actions might include tenant engagement, portfolio transactions, and deep refurbishments. We hold regular deep-dive meetings where we monitor and discuss the decarbonization performance of our asset managers against the set targets.\n\nAs well as setting decarbonization targets per mandate, we exclude certain companies in line with our global energy-related guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas. For further information, please refer to section \"Overarching Policies\". These exclusions therefore contribute to the implementation of our sector targets for oil & gas and utilities that are outlined below. All excluded companies are included in the Allianz Group Risk Global Restricted List and are shared with all asset managers on a regular basis. Asset managers are obliged to comply with these restrictions.\n\nWe aim to finance the transition of companies in the hard-toabate cement and steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5 °C world and have well-defined decarbonization strategies. We will therefore create a separate emission bucket and adjust the sub-portfolio target for listed equity and corporate bonds to reflect additional exposure in those transition leaders included on our new steel and cement climate list.\n\nWe have set sector targets for the high-emitting sectors listed below. These targets will trigger three types of actions supporting our overall GHG emission reduction target: sector engagements (for further information, please refer to section \"Portfolio company decarbonization\"), exclusions, and moving from climate laggards to climate leaders within the respective sectors:\n\n- − Oil & Gas (coverage Allianz O&G 100 list):\n\t- − Scope 1, 2 and 3 (cat 11): 43.07 g CO2e/MJ in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\t- − 100 % of AuM to set net-zero targets across all 3 emission scopes (target year 2025)\n- − Utilities (Coverage Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)):\n\t- − Scope 1: 0.17 t CO2e/MWh in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\t- − Coal phase out in line with 1.5 °C pathway\n- − Steel (Coverage TPI):\n- − Scope 1 and 2: 1.18 t CO2e/t steel in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n- − Automobile (Coverage TPI):\n\t- − Scope 3 (cat 11): 41.68 g CO2e/km in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\nIn 2023, we added the sectors Steel and Automobile. For both sectors, we are currently implementing data flows as a first step.\n\nPortfolio decarbonization will also be fostered by increasing our share in Sustainable Investments. We have achieved our 2025 target for financing the transition; i.e., we have created between 4 and 5 new blended finance vehicles and have made initial investments in forestry and hydrogen.\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>We have therefore included a quantitative 2030 target for investments in climate solutions, which is to increase climate solution investments by at least € 20 bn by 2030, subject to market environment and constraints.\n\nAs a first step to reach this target, we have defined all low-carbon technologies that qualify as climate solutions[1](#page-68-0). We need to develop a process to align and agree on concrete volumes per annum with all relevant stakeholders: operating entities, asset managers, and relevant Group centers.\n\nWe have defined two additional requirements for our investments. Firstly, we will predominantly invest in Article 8 or Article 9 funds (or equivalent) as defined by the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Secondly, we will require a credible transition plan for all unlisted direct investment with a carbon intensity above 100 t CO2e/€ mn invested.\n\n### **Portfolio company decarbonization**\n\nThe extent to which we can achieve reduction of GHG emissions for our investee companies and real estate investments depends on the respective ownership structure. For example, in the case of fully-owned real estate assets, we can directly influence GHG emissions by deep refurbishments. However, if we are only a minority owner, we are restricted to indirectly impacting GHG emissions through engagement, for example, or proxy voting (public equity).\n\nOne indirect lever to reach our 2030 GHG emission reduction targets is therefore continued engagement and support of our portfolio companies. We have consequently implemented a systematic and strong engagement approach across all types of engagements: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager. For further information on our engagement approach, please refer to ou[r 2023 –](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf)  [Allianz Investment Management – Our Engagement Approach](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-Investment-Management_Our-Engagement-Approach-2023.pdf)**.\n\nWe have already achieved our 2025 engagement targets in 2023 as we have engaged the top 30 (non-aligned) emitters in our portfolio, increased our engagement activities by 100 %, and fully participated in all NZAOA sector and asset manager engagements.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_We have started working on harmonizing terminology and underlying eligible technologies related to the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions (currently used for P&C insurance). We expect to conclude this work and report on it in FY2024.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have therefore updated our engagement targets earlier than originally planned. By 2030 (versus September 2023), we firstly want to engage with all external asset managers who are \"below expectations\" based on a systematic assessment. In order to reach this target, we initially need to perform a systematic sustainability assessment of all of our public and private asset managers. If an asset manager does meet our minimum expectations, we will start engagement to close identified gaps. We regularly review our public equity asset managers against best practice guidance (e.g., NZAOA guidance on best practice for proxy voting and climate lobbying).\n\nSecondly, we want to participate in 30 multilateral engagements (at least 15 of them with a focus on climate), either as the lead organization or as a member. In order to reach this target, we will continuously review existing or new multilateral engagement initiatives. In 2023, we joined the collaborative engagement initiative \"Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals\" (IIHC).\n\nThirdly, we aim to engage with 15 non-multilaterally engaged portfolio emitters among the top 100. We will screen the financed GHG emissions of our portfolio companies to identify those qualifying for engagement; i.e., those with the highest financed GHG emissions that are not already engaged.\n\nAs many of our high emitters in the portfolio can only decarbonize properly if the whole sector – including the value chain – decarbonizes, we are also active in sector engagements via multilateral engagement initiatives. Sector engagements are supporting our sector targets for 2030, in particular in the oil & gas and steel sectors. For more information on our sector targets, please refer to the section \"Portfolio allocation changes\".\n\nThe whole investment management function of Allianz is responsible for implementing climate topics in the existing processes and hence in the investment portfolio.\n\n### **Proprietary investment specific policies**\n\nWe are committed to managing climate change risk identified as a material risk for our proprietary investment portfolio. To align our investment management function with this commitment, we have set ambitious GHG emission reduction targets that incentivize respective decision-making (see table \"2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments\"). Our Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI) sets out the rules, principles, and processes that govern the integration and application of climate topics to the Insurance Investment Assets of Allianz.\n\nThe EFRI provides a detailed description of all relevant processes for integrating climate into the investment processes and managing climate risk:\n\n- − Selecting and monitoring asset managers: Asset managers need to adhere to their own qualified sustainability policy including climate as a key topic. Regular review meetings with asset managers covering sustainability topics need to be performed.\n- − Systematic evaluation and scoring of investments: For unlisted assets, a case-by-case evaluation needs to be performed to identify potential sustainability risks. For listed assets, sustainability criteria based on MSCI data are used to screen all investments and inform our investment decision-making.\n- − Active engagements: As an integral part of our strategy, we perform bilateral engagements based on systematic sustainability scoring, multilateral engagements, and asset manager engagements.\n- − Exclusions of certain sectors, companies and sovereigns: Certain investments need to be excluded based on the Allianz guidelines for Oil and Gas and Coal-based business models. Some exclusions are triggered by engagement.\n- − Sustainable Investments: We define sustainable investments in line with the SFDR Article 2 (17) and actively pursue investment opportunities that support solutions to environmental and societal challenges, aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (U.N. SDGs).\n- − Risk management: The Allianz Climate Change Risk Solution (ACCRiS) tool must be used to assess physical climate change risk for fully-owned real estate and prospectively for all single location assets. Whenever a certain level of physical risk is identified, a climate change adaptation plan needs to be implemented.\n\nFor further details, please refer to section \"02.2.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe EFRI applies to all proprietary investment assets excluding unit-linked assets and is owned by the Sustainable Investing team. It is authorized by the respective Allianz SE Board Member responsible for Investments. The EFRI is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe EFRI is mandatory within the Allianz Group for all insurance and reinsurance legal entities, including related pension schemes and all types of investment assets. Sustainability governance is fully integrated into existing governance structures and makes use of existing committees (e.g., the Group Investment Committee).\n\n### **Current emissions**\n\nIn our own operations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint over time. We have established a dedicated unit – Group Sustainable Operations – within Group Operations & IT to align the strategic approach across all Allianz entities, with the aim of reducing their environmental footprint and accelerating impact through setting clear targets and sharing best practice. The main operations in scope are Travel and Fleet, Procurement, Facility Management, and IT.\n\nThe total GHG emissions arising from Allianz Operations were 136,448 t CO2e in 2023. Of that, 31,774 t CO2e result from Scope 1, 7,929 t CO2e from Scope 2, and 96,745 t CO2e from Scope 3. Included Scope 3 GHG emissions from categories 3.1, 3.3, 3.6 and 3.7 cover fueland energy-related emissions, business travel, remote working, public cloud, and paper use. Scope 3 GHG financed emissions which fall under category 3.15 are excluded. For further information, please refer to the section \"Insurance Overarching\" and the section \"Investments Overarching\".

We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target.\n\nOur decarbonization and removal targets for Own Operations remain as communicated in the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBy 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (see section \"Current Emissions\"). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for year-end 2029, 65% versus a 2019 baseline. The target was defined in alignment with the latest climate science. The progress towards our 2030 target is assessed on a yearly basis as part of our annual reporting cycles. In 2023, we made progress by reducing our GHG emissions by 62% per employee compared to our 2019 baseline.\n\n#### **Greenhouse gas emission targets**\n\nt CO2e per employee Emissions Target 2030 Emissions Target 2025 Target 2023 Achievement 2023 Emissions current year 2023 Emissions Baseline 2019 Delta Target 2030 vs Baseline 2019 Delta Target 2025 vs Baseline 2019 Scope 1, 2 and selected scope 3 emissions1 0.828 1.183 We expect in 2023 emissions at a comparable level to 2022 with some post COVID-19 corrections.

RE100 is a global initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.\n\nEnergy sourcing has been a strategic procurement function since 2021 and plays a key role in our transition toward 100% renewable electricity, mainly by shifting energy procurement from locally driven to globally driven processes. Activities in 2023 included leveraging opportunities to agree green tariffs with local power providers and holding conversations with landlords supported by green lease clauses. We encourage green tariffs and local direct investments in Allianz-owned self-generation, centrally supported by PIMCO Prime Real Estate. Furthermore, renewable Energy Attribute Certificates have played a role in the transition to 100%renewable electricity as an interim solution for markets and Allianz entities with limited access to renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved our goal of covering 100% (2022: 89%) of our electricity for all office buildings and data centers with renewable, low carbon sources. 98.6% of this is in line with the RE100 technical criteria and 1.4%is secured via renewable Energy Attribute Certificates from neighboring countries as we operate in some countries like Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Ghana[1](#page-71-0) where there is currently no availability of renewable electricity meeting the RE100 criteria. We continue our efforts to cover all our renewable electricity in line with RE100 technical criteria and will closely monitor the market development in the respective countries.\n\n#### **Buildings**\n\nEmbedding sustainability in our buildings encompasses energy efficiency and reduction. We aim to reduce the energy consumption in our office buildings per employee by 20 % by year-end 2025 against a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe implement environmental management systems (EMS) and energy efficiency processes based on ISO14001 and ISO50001 standards to improve environmental management governance practices at some of our major locations and entities. Some locations also pursue certifications such as LEED, BREEA, etc. To address <span id=\"page-71-1\"></span><span id=\"page-71-0\"></span>energy efficiency and reduction holistically, our operating entities are encouraged to develop approaches to reduce energy consumption.\n\nWe have set up a Buildings Standards Catalogue to harmonize Allianz's approach to sustainability in buildings. This comprehensive listing of minimum standards includes elements of governance- /certifications, furnishings, construction/renovations, renewable energy, energy efficiency, water, waste, food, and commuting, as well as guidance on green lease selection criteria.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved a 47 % reduction in energy consumption in our office buildings per employee compared to our 2019 baseline (2022: 32 %).\n\n#### **Fleet and business travel**\n\nWhen it comes to fleet and business travel, our aim is to continuously reduce corresponding GHG emissions now that COVID-19 measures have been lifted and business trips are permitted again. We aim to reduce our GHG emissions from business travel by 40 % by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. As a signatory of the EV100 initiative, Allianz has committed to fully electrify the company fleet by 2030 at the latest.\n\nThe current travel regulation is under review and – once updated in 2024 – will encompass climate-related topics for business travel. In addition, our travel tools offer a sort and filter function based on CO2 emissions for flight searches. Further, meetings should be held digitally whenever possible.\n\nIn 2023,GHG emissions from business travel were reduced by 44 % per employee against a 2019 baseline[3](#page-71-0) (2022: 47 %). As of 2023, 22 % of our fleet vehicles are electrified[4](#page-71-1) (2022: 11%).\n\n#### **Procurement**\n\nWith regard to our supply chain, our target is to ensure that 100% of global framework vendors – i.e., vendors providing products and services for Allianz globally – have made a public commitment to netzero GHG emissions in line with a 1.5 °C path by 2025.\n\nThe procurement function sources services and products for the Allianz Group by partnering with thousands of vendors all around the world for activities such as IT, professional services, and marketing. Our procurement policy and processes are reviewed regularly. In 2022, they were updated to align with the Allianz Group sustainability strategy and to embed the operations sustainability strategy across procurement activities. To ensure our IT partners are following our\n\n4\\_Including battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Full list of countries: Hong Kong, Bahrain, Cameroon, Ghana, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lebanon, Senegal, Madagascar, Laos, Myanmar, Qatar, Reunion Island, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) are certifications assessing the sustainability of buildings based on a rating system.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\\_GHG emissions from business travel were restated for 2019 (new absolute: 140,787 t CO2e, new relative: 1.0 t CO2e per employee).

The catalogue of questions covers environmental aspects in four categories (Hardware, Software, Application/ Infrastructure & Communication) and produces a rating based on defined sustainability criteria.\n\nOur assessment indicates that, in 2023, 76 % of global framework vendors had an existing net-zero commitment (2022: 65%).\n\nSustainability forms part of the individual contribution factor of the remuneration of each member of the Allianz SE Board of Management. This extends to the decarbonization targets of proprietary investments as well as own operations. For further information, please refer to [Remuneration Report](#page-25-0) and the section \"Corporate responsibility governance and strategy\".\n\nClimate change will materially affect global economies and Allianz, with its international footprint and many different lines of business, is no exception – as already highlighted in the section on materiality analysis. The risks and opportunities emerging today will evolve and increase over the mid to long term. They include acute and chronic physical impacts on property and human health, such as increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves, droughts, and potential changes in vector-borne diseases.\n\nRisks and opportunities also result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks include the impacts of changes in climate policy, technology, and market sentiment, and their impact on the market value of financial assets, as well as impacts resulting from climate change litigation.\n\n#### **Impact on and impact of our business**\n\nThe AllianzGroupis exposed to risks that are influenced by climate change in a multitude of ways. Our core business activities mean that we are affected in two key ways, both of which can influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value:\n\n− As an insurer providing insurance policies – e.g., covering health impacts, property damage, or litigation claims – and through changes in the sectors and business models we underwrite.\n\n− As a large-scale institutional investor with significant interests in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nAs well as being impacted by climate change, the choices Allianz makes about how to conduct our business have an impact on climate change, e.g., by investing in or insuring activities that either cause or reduce GHG emissions. To manage potentially detrimental impacts on both the climate and our business, we have committed to align our proprietary investment and insurance underwriting portfolios to 1.5 °C climate scenarios.\n\n### **Strategy resilience, stress tests, and climate scenario analysis**\n\nClimate change considerations are an integral part of our insurance and investment strategy.\n\nWe apply various quantitative and qualitative strategies when carrying out climate stress testing and scenario analysis. Considerations in this regard include the long-term horizons over which climate change may unfold and the high level of uncertainty over the direction of future climate and economic developments. Our objective is to foster risk awareness, build expertise in the assessment of financial risks from climate change, test our business strategy resilience, and inform risk management and business decision-making.\n\nWe perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons up to 2050 and including scenarios ranging from 1.5 °C to 4 °C of average warming by the end of the century. While time horizons naturally differ depending on the lines of business under consideration, the range of scenarios we apply allows us to better assess a variety of risks associated with climate change.\n\nWhen we conduct analyses that assess 1.5 °C scenario alignment, we adjust our scenario selection using guidance developed by the NZAOA that is focused on 1.5 °C scenarios with no or low overshoot of 1.5 °C of warming. This limits the need to remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere in the second half of the century.\n\nWhen conducting outside-in impact scenario analysis, we use a broader range of scenarios in terms of temperature outcomes and characteristics. Qualitative assessments are conducted to explore to what extent and across which channels climate change risks affect distinct aspects of our business, unconstrained by the still limited availability of quantitative models to fully cover all aspects of climate change across our entire business activities. We deploy quantitative assessments for indicative sizing of our exposure to climate change risks. A top-down approach is developed to assess risks at the level of our balance sheet. Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most relevant exposures provides insights into climate change risks at the level of individual investment or underwriting projects and may support contextualization of results from top-down analyses.\n\nIt should be noted that the analyses included in this report reflect our current approaches to climate change risk assessments. Prevailing methodological and data limitations as well as the high degree of uncertainty inherent in any long-term analysis may still limit the decisionmaking usefulness of some results. However, these approaches will change over time as climate scenarios evolve in line with research, developmental-stage methods improve further, and industry best practices emerge.\n\n#### **Qualitative assessment of climate change risks**\n\nThe guiding objective of the qualitative climate change risk assessment is comprehensiveness, whereby it is important to identify the many ways that Allianz's risk profile can be adversely affected across all areas of the business, in both the short, medium and long term. There are multiple ways in which climate change may trigger risk events, so it is essential that this understanding is established in enough detail for it to provide a solid basis for applying risk-based prioritization with the aim of evaluating mitigation effectiveness and management actions.\n\nTo achieve full coverage of Allianz's business footprint, the assessment was structured along investments, property-casualty underwriting, life/health underwriting, operations, with investments and underwriting further subdivided into asset class and line of business, respectively. For each area (or alternatively, asset class for investments, and line of business for underwriting), the main relevant climate change-related risk drivers were identified. In this context, a risk driver is any development or event wholly or primarily attributable to climate change that potentially impacts Allianz's risk profile. Such risk drivers can be categorized into technological, regulatory, legal, and consumer behavior developments (transition risks), as well as physical risks such as floods, drought, or wildfires.\n\nFor each risk driver, a range of potential short- to medium-term and long-term impacts for the insurance sector was considered, utilizing knowledge acquired via a combination of desktop research and consultation with subject matter experts both internal and external to Allianz. Lastly, the potential magnitude of each of these risk impacts was assessed against various dimensions of financial and non-financial performance.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\nThe initial qualitative risk assessment was performed throughout 2022 at the Allianz Group level. During 2023, subsidiaries adapted the assessment according to their local risk profiles. The outcome of this exercise provides further insights into the relevance of climate change risk drivers for both the AllianzGroup as a whole and individual subsidiaries, taking into account their specific business profile, geographical presence, and locally applicable regulations.\n\nFor a summary of the main climate change risks faced by the Allianz Group as well as corresponding impacts derived from the qualitative risk assessment, please see tables \"Key climate change transition risks\" and \"Key climate change physical risks\".\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Key climate change transition risks**\n\n| Risk driver                | Context

Emerging technologies      | Climate change mitigation and adaption is driving the rapid<br>development of new or modification of existing technologies (e.g.<br>sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture and storage, electric<br>vehicles).<br>Although many of these technologies presently face challenges in<br>terms of quickly scaling up – whether due to prohibitive cost, an<br>inadequate supply of raw inputs, missing infrastructure, customer<br>skepticism or a need to further develop the technology itself – it is<br>expected that many of these issues will be resolved over time and the<br>technologies will become widely adopted.

disadvantages via a combination of higher energy costs,<br>higher financing costs or costs from participation in carbon emissions trading schemes. On the revenues side, customers may become<br>adverse towards companies that fail to adopt climate-related technologies. This risk is particularly relevant for those business sectors<br>with a comparatively high emissions footprint, such as energy, transportation and construction.<br>- Stranded assets are also possible, whereby technological breakthroughs render older, high emission technologies obsolete, in<br>particular when further squeezed by decarbonization-related regulations. Conversely, it is also possible that promising technologies<br>ultimately fail to deliver on their potential and earn a return on substantial investments in research and development.<br>- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be<br>impacted by the above developments.<br>Underwriting<br>The introduction of new technologies may lead to more frequent and severe malfunctions, damage or process disruptions, especially<br>in the early application phase. Areas of particular vulnerability include electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, such as<br>battery energy storage systems. In this context, providing insurance coverage may represent a challenge for insurers due to the lack<br>of historical claims data as a basis for modeling and pricing, which may trigger an increase in insured manufacturers' product liability |\n| Regulatory<br>developments | As signatories to the Paris Agreement, many countries have adopted<br>legally binding commitments in line with the Paris Agreement target<br>of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well<br>below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the<br>temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.<br>To deliver on these commitments countries are enacting increasingly<br>stringent regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as<br>the phase out of combustion engines, encouraging the adoption of<br>heat pumps or increasing the share of sustainably produced energy.<br>Given the swift and drastic reduction required, the impact of these<br>regulations is widespread across many business sectors, although<br>naturally most consequential for those responsible for the largest<br>share of emissions. | exposure.<br>Investments<br>- Increasingly complex and partly untested regulations promoting mitigation and adaptation to climate change may trigger<br>significant costs or losses for companies operating in high emission sectors, both in terms of implementation costs and as a direct<br>consequence of the policies themselves. Direct consequences include write-down costs, whereby as a result of a regulatory directive,<br>the projected financial return on company assets is diminished.<br>- Furthermore, fragmentation of regulations at a regional and global level may lead to competitive disadvantages based on a<br>company's geographic location, especially for companies that are highly dependent on international trade. Competitive<br>disadvantages may result from either operating under a comparatively strict set of regulations relative to peers (e.g. carbon emission<br>limits), or conversely, due to regulations enacted to counter such environmental arbitrage (e.g. border taxes, restricted market access<br>for companies with poor climate practices).<br>- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be<br>impacted by the above developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Operations<br>- Allianz is committed to full compliance with all climate-change regulations applicable to the organization.

Climate attribution science supports the assignment of responsibility for climate-change related damages to those companies historically responsible for a large share of emissions, whether from the extraction and processing of fossil fuels or their consumption via production or product use (e.g. energy generation, transportation). As the confidence levels of climate attribution models improve they may increasingly be recognized by courts and juries in determining culpability and corresponding damages. Given past studies suggesting a relatively small number of companies are responsible for an outsized share of total historical emissions – primarily within the oil & gas and utility sectors – the legal exposure of these companies in particular may be quite significant. |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | - In addition to the costs or losses directly attributable to climate-change related regulations, companies also face legal exposures for failure to comply. Against the backdrop of sweeping regulations and tight timelines for their adoption – which is unavoidable in the light of nations' legally binding emission reduction commitments – it may prove challenging for certain companies or even entire sectors to fully comply. This is relevant not only for operations and product design, but also climate-change related reporting and disclosure requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | - Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be impacted by the above developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Underwriting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The above climate litigation drivers for investments may also adversely impact Allianz' risk profile with respect to Underwriting Risks. Greenwashing, advances in climate attribution science, new and expanded regulations and an overall increase in climate-change related litigation all introduce new and potentially significant legal exposures for many of Allianz' commercial policyholders, especially those operating in high-emission sectors such as oil & gas, energy generation or transportation. Allianz risk exposures arise from indemnity coverages for legal proceedings against these policyholders, in particular within the D&O and Liability lines of business.

Extreme weather<br>(acute physical risk<br>event)      | Climate change is the primary driver behind a contemporary increase<br>in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which<br>trigger losses in the form of human casualties, physical damages and<br>disruptions to business or leisure activities.

        | Investments<br>- Within the real estate sector property valuations may increasingly be dependent on exposure to extreme weather events, both from<br>a macro- and micro-geographic perspective. The most exposed properties might experience higher losses from property damage, a<br>loss of rental income due to business disruptions and higher insurance and financing costs. While measures may be taken to help<br>mitigate the real estate impact of extreme weather events, such as strengthening structures against wind and flood damage, these<br>typically require costly investments. These issues also largely apply towards the construction and infrastructure sectors as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - At a sovereign level, government finances may become strained through an ever increasing need to finance recovery and repair<br>efforts following catastrophic weather events.

This projection concerns not only property claims due to direct physical damage, but other coverages as well, such as those typically contained within business interruption, accident, entertainment, and travel policies.\n\n- Claims for liability coverages may also increase insofar as policyholders are considered negligent in protecting customers or other third parties from damages caused by extreme weather events.\n\n- In addition to impacts derived from policy exposures, it may also become increasingly cost-prohibitive for Allianz to obtain reinsurance coverages in line with our risk appetite and risk bearing capacity. Such developments might restrict our ability to underwrite some risk exposures and – in extreme cases – precipitate an exit from certain insurance markets.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\noperations and life/health underwriting are also present, albeit to a comparatively dynamic period of transition risk relevance. lesser extent.\n\nmore significant in the short to medium term than in the long term\n\nand property-casualty underwriting.

While this may run contrary to the understanding blunt impact severity in the longer term. This includes both adaptive encouraging movement away from disaster prone areas – and mitigation measures by Allianz, such as improvements in the management of insurance risk concentrations and the pricing of insurance coverages.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen considering the above results, it is important to understand that outcomes of this qualitative process are highly dependent on the input of individual risk experts. Although the process leveraged research and statistical information where possible, professional judgment was applied in determining the impacts specific to Allianz. Provided that professional judgment is subject to various forms of bias, results are liable to change. In addition, the emergence of further statistical and other fact-based research may also influence conclusions.\n\nFor further information on mitigation measures to address and manage risk impacts, please refer to the section \"Conclusion\".\n\n#### **Quantitative assessment of climate change risks**\n\nThe integrated climate change stress test presented in the following section complements the holistic qualitative risk assessment with quantitative information for a limited set of risks and risk transmission channels. It demonstrates our continuing efforts to build capabilities and capacities for quantitative climate change risk assessments and gain experience with sizing balance sheet exposures to climate change risks.\n\nThe stress test covers both sides of the balance sheet by measuring asset- or liability-specific stress impacts, as well as their dependencies for a static balance sheet. We take into account a period up to 2050, which is relevant both for the implementation of key political and business strategies linked to the Paris Climate Agreement and for the onset of increasing global warming and its negative consequences. Impacts are estimated for market stresses, as well as property-casualty and life/health underwriting stresses, using NGFS[1](#page-78-0)/IPCC[2](#page-78-1) scenario-based data from various sources. NGFS scenarios are selected for this analysis since they are compiled on behalf of central banks and supervisory authorities for financial stress testing, provide pathways for macroeconomic variables in a variety of scenarios representing different levels of transition and physical risk, and are available open source. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are the starting point of well-established scientific studies on the development of climate-related hazards in climate change scenarios, which can be adapted for modelling underwriting risks. All entities contributing to the Allianz Group's Solvency II model are in scope for the assessment. The main focus of the analysis is to provide a best estimate for market value balance sheet impacts.\n\nFor the current implementation of the integrated climate change stress test, we have considered five scenario narratives from the suite of NGFS reference scenarios. The (1) Net Zero 2050 scenario is determined by an orderly transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 following the target to limit global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies at the cost of moderate economic strain in the initial years. The (2) Below 2 °C scenario assumes an early and orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, with an unambitious policy target to limit global warming to below 2 °C by the end of the century. In this scenario, policy action has limited impact on economic growth. In the (3) Delayed Transition scenario, GHG emissions remain high until 2030, when strong policy measures are taken to limit warming to below 2 °C. Physical risks are relatively small in these scenarios over the 2050 time horizon.\n\nThe (4) Nationally Determined Contributions scenario includes all pledged climate policies, even if not yet implemented. However, these pledged policies are still insufficient to limit global warming to below 2 °C, leading to increasing physical risks. Accounting only for climate policies that were in place before 2019, the (5) Current Policies scenario is characterized by limited transition risks and high physical risks, which start to become more visible over the second half of the projection period.\n\nNGFS scenarios are used to obtain financial market variables for application in the market stress module of the integrated climate change stress test. The market stresses themselves are applied to market values of both assets and liabilities of in-scope entities, where a simplified approach is used to assess the mitigation of stress impacts due to policyholder profit sharing. Scenario variables used in the property-casualty and life/health underwriting stress modules are derived from hazard models that are contingent on the IPCC's RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. For the life/health underwriting stress module, stress variables are based on a study by Gasparrini et al.[3](#page-78-0) that projects temperature-related excess mortality under various heat and cold pathways and their net change up to the end of the century. The life/health underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of <span id=\"page-78-1\"></span><span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>liabilities for biometric risk exposure. The property-casualty underwriting stress module relies on projections for Average Annual Loss under RCP scenarios for a selection of the most climate changerelevant country and peril combinations (i.e., inland flooding, hail and tropical cyclone) developed by NatCat modeling experts at Allianz Re. The property-casualty underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for NatCat risk exposures.\n\nTo separate the impact of climate change risk from trend growth, stress levels are assessed relative to a baseline or counterfactual scenario as defined by the NGFS, a hypothetical scenario in which neither progression of climate change nor the implementation of transition measures is assumed. Furthermore, the calculation of stress impacts is based on instantaneous stresses on the static year-end 2023 balance sheet, without adaptation or mitigation actions from Allianz and its business partners. In particular, internal measures such as contract repricing, deployment of reinsurance strategies, or portfolio steering have not been taken into account, as well as external measures such as public investment in flood defences. Impact estimates from the different stress test modules are integrated based on a matching of global mean temperatures for 2050 between NGFS and IPCC scenarios as well as consideration of the overall scenario characteristics. No diversification between market stresses and underwriting stresses is assumed for the aggregation.\n\nImpact estimates from the integrated climate change stress test rely on scientific research and scenario data that is available and considered relevant as of the current point in time. Nevertheless, the magnitude of outcomes has to be treated with caution when accounting for the significant uncertainties inherent in climate change modeling and the crucial role of assumptions in long-term projections. These include, but are not limited to, uncertainties in the scientific studies underlying the projected distributions of NatCat events, uncertainties in the modeling of macroeconomic impacts of physical risks, as well as uncertainties due to the limitations of climate change scenarios in capturing environmental, social, and economic cascading effects or tipping points. Uncertainties around assumptions for the counterfactual scenario can also have a critical impact on results.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_NGFS: Network for Greening the Financial System. 2\\_IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of the aggregate market and property-casualty and life/health underwriting stress impacts, two key overarching observations may be derived. Firstly, with the exception of the Delayed Transition scenario, cumulative market value balance sheet impacts over the first 5-10 years of the projection period are largely determined by the different levels of transition risk in the scenarios, whereas impacts from physical risks are small in comparison but increase gradually. Secondly, market stress is the largest contributor to overall cumulative market value balance sheet impacts, exceeding the combined contribution from property-casualty and life/health underwriting stresses by a considerable margin.\n\nExpounding upon the above general observations at the individual scenario level, we note the following:\n\n- − Moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts are realized in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, where the initial economic strain subsides rapidly until 2030.\n- − The orderly implementation of the not too ambitious policy target in the Below 2 °C scenario comes with a low transition risk initially. While stress impacts in the long term in the Below 2 °C scenario are comparable to stress impacts in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, an overall negative trend compared to the 1.5 °C scenario is predicted in the second half of the century due to higher physical risk associated with higher mean temperatures.\n- − In the Delayed Transition scenario, very low stress impacts materialize in initial years, followed by high cumulative market value balance sheet impacts of (13.6) % after 2035 with the start of the delayed implementation of a policy ambition that is comparable to that in the Below 2 °C scenario. Economic recovery is rather slow in this scenario.\n- − Initial losses from transition risk in the Nationally Determined Contributions scenarios, comparable to losses in the Below 2 °C scenarios, turn into losses from physical risk in later years that gradually increase over time.\n- − In the absence of stringent climate policy implementation, stress impacts are relatively muted until the second half of the time horizon for the Current Policies scenario, similar to the Delayed Transition scenario, where stress impacts from physical risk phase in bringing about moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts of approximately (5.5) % in the long term. Beyond this period, both the Current Policies and the Nationally\n\nDetermined Contributions scenarios are expected to entail even more material losses as impacts from physical risks increase and outweigh transition risk impacts.\n\nAn excerpt from the aggregated stress test results is shown in table \"Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change\". The complete analysis covers the period from now until 2050, whereas the excerpt here shows the estimated maximum adverse impacts over the 5-20 year period, taking into account, amongst other considerations, that the current NGFS scenarios are primarily aimed at modeling long-term climateeconomic relationships.\n\n**Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change**\n\n%\n\n| Scenario                            | Long-term<br>5-20 years |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net Zero 2050                       | (2.8)                   |\n| Below 2 °C                          | (2.7)                   |\n| Delayed Transition                  | (13.6)                  |\n| Nationally Determined Contributions | (5.2)                   |\n| Current Policies                    | (5.5)                   |\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nIt is apparent from a review of the results of the qualitative risk assessment and consideration of potential risk responses that while some new mitigation measures (such as processes, controls, strategies) tailored to climate change may be necessary, the current risk management approaches are generally either adequate, or only require smaller modifications. For example, with respect to propertycasualty underwriting, well-established techniques such as premium adjustments, changes in coverages, exclusions, expansions, or revisions to risk limits can all be effectively utilized. Despite this conclusion, the consequences in areas where climate change is set to fundamentally transform insurance markets are less predictable and require strategic attention. Fundamental transformation includes aspects such as coverage affordability, the shrinkage of existing markets, or the emergence of new markets, as well as products or coverages encompassing difficult-to-price risks (e.g., similar to industry experience around the emergence of cyber insurance).\n\nFrom the quantitative perspective, the overall impact estimates derived from the integrated climate change stress test are considered to be within Allianz's risk tolerance, considering both the magnitude of predicted losses and the time horizon over which they materialize. Extending this analysis to a dynamic balance sheet view would further support this assessment; for example, accounting for risk mitigating management actions such as adaptation of derivatives hedging and reinsurance programs, repricing of insurance products, or strategic repositioning of investment and insurance portfolios. The approximate estimates we carried out on the effectiveness of selected management actions confirm this view.\n\nAddressing the immediate effects of climate policy implementation requires the incorporation of climate change-specific measures. These include long-term strategies aimed at aligning investment and insurance portfolios with climate policy targets, as formulated in our transition plan, see the section \"Transition plan & strategy\". However, successfully managing an economic crisis that may unfold as an indirect effect of climate policy implementation – e.g., in the Delayed Transition scenario – necessitates having well-established mitigation measures ready and operational, such as limiting or hedging equity and corporate bond exposures, or effective asset liability management.\n\nWe will continue to refine our climate change risk assessments in line with the evolving understanding of assessment methodologies and improving data availability and quality, while also accounting for a shifting climatic and political baseline.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Social matters\n\nThe following section describes the impact of social matters on our business activities and relationships, and the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships on society. We describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on social impact and responsible consumer/sales policies.\n\nAllianz is committed to having a positive social impact and helping to deliver the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). For further information on our commitment to the UN SDGs, please refer to the sections \"01.4\", \"01.5\" and \"04.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**. We understand social impact as the effect that our global organization has on the well-being of the community – from global society to local communities where we live and work. This ambition is lived out through our company purpose, our group-wide business strategy, and the local efforts of our operating entities.\n\nOur long-term approach as an investor and insurer is an opportunity to offer measures that can mitigate future risks and shape societies for generations; for example, through pension systems, environmental and climate protection. As a global insurer, we uphold the principle of solidarity. Pooling risks is part of our core business model and we have a keen interest in supporting stable communities. We have a role to play in enabling future generations and persons with disabilities to overcome the economic and social impacts of social risks.\n\n### **Tax transparency**\n\nAt Allianz, we are continuously engaging in tax transparency. We consider taxes to be a core component of corporate responsibility and sustainability.\n\nOur ambition is to take a responsible approach to the management of taxes. We aim for being recognized as a compliant, co-operative and reliable taxpayer in each country we operate. For a comprehensive description of our approach see our Group Tax Strategy on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_TTR_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nIn 2023, we have consolidated our tax transparency reporting products while keeping the same level of information. We are presenting our total tax contribution and our country-by-country reporting now in our Sustainability Report along with other information about current tax topics and developments.\n\n### **Corporate citizenship**\n\nWe are aware that our actions have the potential to influence the future living conditions, employability and well-being of young people and persons with disabilities and that our decisions play an integral part in determining this future.\n\nAllianz wants to shape its social impact in a meaningful and lasting way. This social impact stems from both the nature of our business and the effect that our global organization has on the wellbeing of the communities it is active in.\n\nWe view supporting and upskilling young people and persons with disabilities to help them get into education and employability as one way to contribute to SDGs, and in particular to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\nOur ambition is shaped by our company purpose, \"We secure your future\", defined by our group-wide business strategy, and brought to life through our employees and the local efforts of our operating entities (OE) who actively implement our Corporate Citizenship Strategy and strengthen its alignment with the SDG 8 but also with SDG 17 via philanthropic initiatives, global partnerships and volunteerism.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Social Impact Fund (SIF) which supports our OE's strategic opportunities by focusing on creating measurable impact through intersectoral partnerships.\n\nOn top of this social work and based on the lessons learned from existing partnerships with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Allianz has further developed a major global initiative: Move Now is a program that prepares our focus groups for their professional future by offering opportunities to move mentally and physically. It is an initiative that OEs can run in the countries we operate in and an initiative which we support financially with our SIF.\n\nFor MoveNow, the SIF picks up and leverages existing formats from the partnerships with the IOC and the IPC. In 2023, it provided resources for 18 local partnerships that focus on the goals of SDG 8. To further support its local entities in setting their ambitions and measuring and reporting on the impact of corporate citizenship activities at a local level, Allianz has introduced the Allianz Social Impact Measurement Framework.\n\nFor further information, please refer to section \"04.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n### **Objectives and actions: societal impact**\n\n| Topic                            | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate citizenship strategy   | Continue with the implementation of the new strategy and roll-out of the impact measurement<br>framework.                                                                                                                     | Integrated Social Impact Measurement Framework into data collection process to enhance input-<br>output-outcome-impact (IOOI) reporting in support of local entities setting their ambitions and<br>measuring the impact of corporate citizenship activities. |\n| Corporate citizenship activities | - Continue to contribute to society through corporate giving and employee volunteering in alignment<br>with our strategy.<br>- Identify and launch activities that would be supported through the Allianz Social Impact Fund. | Social Impact Fund supported 18 corporate citizenship programs led by operating entities (OEs) in<br>partnership with NGOs in delivery of social impact locally in alignment with global strategy.                                                            |\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Responsible consumer/sales\n\nOur strong reputation is built on the trust our customers, shareholders, employees, and the general public place in our integrity. This trust hinges on the quality of our products, information, and advice, and on the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and representatives.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our corporate culture. The Code emphasizes that fairness towards customers and transparent communication about our products and services – including their limitations – maximizes our opportunity to earn the long-term trust of customers. This is expressed through our Global Sales Compliance Framework program, which specifies standardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring, and review, and is regularly updated to reflect regulatory developments.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance aims to promote and protect the interests of our customers. It is designed to ensure transparency and the fair, honest, and responsible treatment of Allianz customers in their purchase of our financial products and their dealings with us. The Standard lays the foundation for a comprehensive customer protection framework designed to ensure all Allianz entities adhere to its prudential norms and robust protection. It covers five key areas to address conduct risk: Product Oversight and Governance, Incentives and Steering of Distributors, Standard of Distribution, Sales Force Selection and Training, and Monitoring and Reporting.\n\nWe use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score®(NPS) as our key metric for measuring customer loyalty through customers' willingness to recommend Allianz. In 2022, we switched to digital NPS tracking. The digital NPS paradigm allows us to measure customer loyalty continuously, eliminating seasonality and deepening our understanding of customers' sentiment. Additionally, the new measurement sets higher standards for our operating entities, which are measured against a broader set of competitors. This year, we achieved a remarkable NPS of 59% Loyalty Leadership across all our business segments. This result exceeds our target (50% loyalty leaders by 2024) and reinforces our position as a trusted and preferred insurance and financial service partner.\n\nOur Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic and standardized methodology to monitor and improve the customer experience by collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative feedback. Customers are invited to rate their satisfaction on a five-star scale after their recent experience at predefined touch points along five customer journeys. To this end, we map the main interactions a customer has with Allianz along the following journeys: Sales & Onboarding; Claims; Issue Resolution & Contract Management; Renewal, Cancelation & Termination; and Outbound Communication. If customers rate their experience with three stars or fewer, we follow up with them to resolve the issue directly and gather more insights.\n\nWe use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS to improve our products, services, communications, and processes. We combine and analyze sources of customer data in strict accordance with applicable privacy laws to prioritize and implement structural improvements. Local operating entities use customer feedback to derive concrete actions.\n\nFindings from the VoC and dNPS programs also help us design the global Allianz experience for our customers. In 2023, we continued our journey to co-create and scale one global Allianz customer experience by developing additional initiatives. Firstly, we continued to implement the Annual Policy Review initiative, which was launched in November 2022, as a way to engage with customers and discuss their insurance portfolio and current needs.\n\nSecondly, we worked together with the Allianz Behavioral Economics team to improve the policy renewal communication template by providing customers with more clarity and transparency. And thirdly, in June 2023, we launched a global Prewarning & Prevention initiative, focused on helping customers prevent damage to their property due to climate-related events. Working with climate scientists and risk experts across the Group, we co-created the Global Risk Assessment (GloRiA) tool and customer education assets, which enable users to learn more about the Nat Cat risks associated with their place of residence.\n\nThe Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end global business model that puts the customer at the center of our business and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable. Our ambition is to simplify and harmonize our business globally.\n\nWithin this context, the Allianz Customer Model was designed first for Retail Property and Casualty lines and then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, Large Corporate and Reinsurance.\n\nOur target has been to continuously roll out the model across Allianz operating entities. As of the second quarter of 2023, ACM has been rolled out to 39 operating entities, comprising 99% of gross written premium (GWP) for our retail Property and Casualty business.\n\nA tangible example of how the Allianz Customer Model is transforming our business is our Master Products. A Master Product is a template available in the Allianz Product Lab with streamlined product elements that are linked to harmonized claims and pricing values. Allianz OEs can configure Master Products to create the right product for their market and make adaptations that are required by regulation. So far, we have created 21 Property-Casualty Master Products which cover more than 90% of Property-Casualty GWP in our OEs (excluding global lines). Harmonized Master Products allow us to efficiently scale essential IT assets such as Quote & Buy and First Notification of Loss in the Business Master Platform. This platform digitalizes the business requirements of the ACM. It comprises a combination of scalable technological elements, systems and services plus functionalities and configurations, to better serve our customers, intermediaries, partners, and employees.\n\nThis involves transforming the whole value chain across products, sales, claims, and operations. Our aim is to continuously roll out the model across Allianz OEs.\n\nRather than selling individual insurance products, our vision is to evolve our products into full ecosystems and offer customers relevant and trusted solutions. In addition, we are using the ACM to upgrade customer journeys at the Group level.\n\nOur approach to customer responsibility and compliance is described in the section \"04.3\" of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Cybersecurity\n\nIn this section, we describe the impact of cybersecurity on our business activities and relationships, as well as the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships with regard to IT topics. In addition, we describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy, and data ethics.\n\nInformation security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from unauthorized access and against cyberattacks, and to meet related regulatory requirements. Our dedicated Information Security function aims to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information across the Allianz Group.\n\nAs a core business discipline, information security is managed globally through a robust and mature governance framework aligned with international standard ISO 27001. Our approach is closely monitored by a dedicated Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) function and the Allianz SE Board of Management. An executive accountability regime supports the enforcement of the governance framework for all entities.\n\nThe Allianz Information Security Governance Framework comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes. An overall policy establishes core principles, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the Information Technology and Information Security organizational framework within the Allianz Group.\n\nThe functional rules are complemented by detailed descriptions of best practices to be followed across 16 defined topics to ensure the \"'security by design\"' principle. Information security is regularly audited, both internally and externally, and regular training is provided through dedicated exercises across all layers of the organization.\n\nTo fulfill our commitment, cyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed along key risk indicators covering security maturity, risk exposure, and security operations across the Allianz Group. Performance against these indicators is discussed, reviewed, and reported quarterly to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. Monitoring for cyber incidents, and measures to prevent them from occurring, are implemented at a global level and supplemented locally where required, together with the local CISOs that exist in all Allianz operating entities.\n\nSpecific actions to improve security controls are continuously evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, riskbased view that is informed by the current and expected threat landscape. Actions to achieve our cyber risk targets focus on five key risk areas: reducing the likelihood of incidents; increasing the likelihood of detection; reducing damage from incidents; streamlining compliance; and training/educating the organization to further improve security awareness.\n\nAll employees are required to participate in cyber-awareness training at least quarterly. This training includes activities like simulated phishing e-mails, awareness campaigns, and dedicated information security training, with the latter being offered regularly. We also participate in industry and global/regional initiatives to support the security of the internet ecosystem as a whole.\n\nFurther information on our commitment to information security is described in the section \"05.1.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nProtecting personal data and maintaining trust in our processes are key priorities. Our customers, employees, and other stakeholders expect us to treat their data with the utmost care and we take this responsibility extremely seriously. We are committed to the highest standards to protect customer privacy and we work closely with other stakeholders involved in the update and modernization of European privacy legislation, including industry associations, members of parliament, and authorities. We also strive to communicate honestly and openly about actions that involve the personal data we process by publishing privacy notices that explain who we are, how we collect, share, and use personal data, and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights.\n\nOur group-wide privacy program ensures compliance with all relevant data privacy laws and regulations. All data privacy matters are overseen by Group Data Privacy.\n\nThe Allianz Privacy Standard (APS) is our global standard for data privacy and the foundation of the Allianz Privacy Framework. As the highest policy document in the Allianz Privacy Framework, the APS defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal data, including the ten privacy principles that all employees must respect wherever they are in the world:\n\n- 1. Due care.\n- 2. Data quality (purpose limitation, data minimization and storage limitation).\n- 3. Lawful basis (personal data is only processed if we have a lawful basis to do so).\n- 4. Transparency and openness towards employees and customers on where personal data is stored and used.\n- 5. Relationships with data processors (ensure organizations that process personal data on our behalf adhere to our privacy requirements).\n- 6. Adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred.\n- 7. Security and confidentiality (appropriate technical and organizational security safeguards are in place to protect personal data).\n- 8. Timely reporting of personal data breaches.\n- 9. Privacy by design and default.\n- 10. Cooperation with data protection authorities.\n\nIn addition to the APS, our data protection authority has approved our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which allow Allianz Group companies to lawfully transfer personal data from within the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it is required for business purposes.\n\nOur employees play a critical role in upholding our commitment to protect personal data. To ensure all our employees have the knowledge to properly use and safeguard personal data, they are required to complete annual privacy training. This training covers the Allianz Privacy Framework requirements in detail and provides a solid foundational understanding of core privacy concepts and the proper handling of personal data. For Privacy Experts, five-day Privacy Expert Training is focused on providing Data Privacy Professionals and Data Protection Officers with the practical knowledge to effectively conduct their day-to-day activities. For Privacy Champions, two-day Privacy Champion Training is focused on the practical knowledge and exercises required for the Privacy Champion role to ensure data protection compliance within the business.\n\nAs part of our Privacy Risk Management process, we identify and manage privacy risks at the operational process level to ensure they are measured, monitored, and mitigated across our core businesses. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of processes that use personal data – such as customer health data and employee data – enable the early identification of privacy risks and ensure they are managed appropriately. We also undertake case-by-case Transfer Impact \n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nAssessments (TIAs) for processes that transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to suppliers in third countries in order to confirm an adequate level of data privacy is maintained. We designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform, which was rolled out to all our operating entities in the EEA to ensure such assessments are conducted in a consistent, semi-automated way.\n\nIn committing to the highest standards of data protection, we believe the maintenance of a state-of-the-art privacy program needs to be supported by diligent and continuous monitoring and assurance activities. Privacy reviews require every operating entity, global line, and regional office to undergo a rigorous examination of the design, implementation, and effectiveness of its local privacy program and related process and controls. The frequency of these reviews is based on risk, but they are carried out at least once every five years. As of the end of 2023, we have conducted 22 privacy reviews, including joint reviews with Information Security and peer Data Protection Officers (DPOs). This is a 37% increase compared to 2022 and concludes the five-year privacy review cycle.\n\nFor further information on our commitment to data privacy, please refer to the section \"05.1.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website.](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**\n\nOur aim is to maintain stakeholder trust and position Allianz as a leader in conducting data-driven business in a trustworthy and ethical manner. This includes elevating data ethics as well as selected data and analytics-related topics in the governance and decision-making processes of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe strive for a responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our business activities based on a strong AI Governance Framework. This includes ensuring a human-centric approach in our usage of AI systems. For each AI system, an appropriate level of human control must be determined according to the inherent risks of harm for individuals as part of a Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment.\n\nEnsuring compliance with current and upcoming regulations and embedding best practices in anticipation of regulatory change are also high priorities in fulfilling our data ethics commitments.\n\nFollowing its establishment in 2021, the Data Advisory Board (DAB) has continued its work to elevate and integrate data ethics into governance and decision-making, as well as to support the positioning of Allianz as both a leading insurer and investor in the data ethics space and wider sustainability efforts. In 2023, the DAB monitored the final implementation of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI in OEs that are members of the Renewal Agenda Committee.\n\nFurthermore, emerging risks regarding generative AI have been addressed by dedicated guidelines in further development of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI. Training led by Group Privacy and Group Data Analytics has been expanded to target a broader employee base as well as employees who develop and/or use AI in applicable OEs.\n\nFor further information on our commitment to data ethics, please refer to the section \"05.1.3\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nWe are constantly developing our solutions to enable customers to manage cyber threats. As an example, Allianz (within its commercial Property-Casualty products) has eradicated around 98% of silent cyber exposure, therefore providing clarity to customers on what is and is not covered within the products. As an insurer, we combine policy and service improvements to help businesses understand the need to strengthen their controls. We continue to evolve cyber risk exposure coverage across Property-Casualty policies spanning commercial, corporate, and specialty insurance segments. The Cyber Underwriting Strategy addresses exposures to cyber risks and is reviewed regularly to ensure policies are updated and clarified in response to cyber risks.\n\nFor further information on cyber risk, please refer to the section \"05.1.4\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf) [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n### **Objectives and actions: cybersecurity**\n\n| Topic                                         | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Information security executive accountability | -

The Allianz Sustainability Board oversees human rights due diligence for the Allianz Group, while Global Sustainability seeks to continuously improve human rights related governance.\n\nThe human rights that Allianz is committed to respecting are those agreed by governments in:\n\n- − The International Bill of Human Rights: This consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.\n- − The core International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions: These include the prohibition of child labor and forced labor; freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; occupational health and safety; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nAllianz has been a member of the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002 and uses the UNGC principles to guide its business activities. These principles cover human rights, labor rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. For further information on Allianz's Communication on Progress, please refer to the **[UNGC website](https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/497-Allianz-SE)**.\n\nAllianz aims to identify, prevent, mitigate, or remediate adverse human rights impacts linked to our business activities and operations, including in our supply chain. Our approach is guided by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).\n\n### **Human rights in our own operations and supply chain**\n\nAllianz SE has been subject to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA) since 1 January 2023. GSCA applies to large companies based in Germany and their \"own business area\". The own business area of Allianz SE (as the holding company of the Allianz Group) encompasses all entities that are part of the Allianz System of Governance, irrespective of location. Therefore, our GSCA risk management covers all those Allianz entities and their suppliers worldwide.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the Allianz Policy Statement on Human Rights[1](#page-84-0) on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-SE_Human-Rights-Policy-Statement-2023.pdf)**.\n\nAs part of GSCA implementation, Allianz has implemented further due diligence procedures that are appropriate to ensure that risks to the human rights of people working for Allianz or for our suppliers, and those whose human rights may otherwise be directly affected by the economic activities of Allianz or its suppliers are minimized, and that breaches are remedied promptly and adequately.\n\nAt the heart of our due diligence processes are annual and adhoc analyses of human rights risks in our own operations and supplier base worldwide. If risks are identified, we take appropriate measures to minimize them. If human rights violations are identified, we take immediate remedial action to address those violations, in line with our influence on respective suppliers.\n\nAllianz SE publishes an annual human rights policy statement and reports annually to the responsible regulator (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle) about our human rights due diligence.\n\nA Group Human Rights Officer was appointed in 2023 to monitor the effectiveness of our risk management systems in our own operations and supply chain worldwide.\n\nFor further information on our people and culture strategies, please refer to the section \"Employee matters\" and the section \"04.2\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects Allianz's values and principles and gives our employees guidance in their actions and decisions. At Allianz, we expect employees to support and adhere to human rights in alignment with international standards. For further information, please refer to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/code-of-conduct/en-Code-of-Conduct-AllianzGroup-2020.pdf)**.\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Further measures have been implemented to minimize risks to relevant human rights and labor standards in our own operations. These include:\n\n- − The protection of human rights has been enshrined in our internal corporate rules, depending on local laws and requirements.\n- − Anonymous feedback tools and surveys give our employees the opportunity to evaluate issues such as workload, wages, and diversity.\n- − Extensive measures have been put in place to ensure the physical safety of employees, as well as to improve their health and wellbeing.\n\nWe at Allianz expect all our suppliers to act with integrity and to respect the rights of their own employees and other people who may be affected by the supplier's business activities. These expectations are embedded in our **[Vendor Code of Conduct](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/Allianz_Vendor-Code-of-Conduct.pdf)** and **[Sustainable](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/AllianzSustainableProcurementCharter.pdf)  [Procurement Charter](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/AllianzSustainableProcurementCharter.pdf)**.\n\nAllianz has established a worldwide complaints mechanism that is open to Allianz employees, the employees of our suppliers, and other people whose rights might be impacted by Allianz's operations and business activities.\n\n### **Human rights in our business activities**\n\nAs a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence process forms part of our overall sustainability approach which is integrated into our broader risk management system.\n\nWe use a combination of sector and country-specific approaches to identify human rights risks.\n\nHuman rights-related due diligence has been integrated into all sensitive business areas where relevant, to ensure that human rights are part of the overall risk assessment for insurance and investments in non-listed asset classes.\n\nWe maintain a mandatory referral list for sensitive countries where systematic human rights violations occur. For business transactions located in these countries, we carry out explicit due diligence in accordance with our Human Rights Guideline that covers various human rights violations.\n\nWhen a human rights risk is identified by an underwriter or investment manager, a mandatory referral process starts for further\n\n1\\_As part of its human rights due diligence under the German Supply Chain Act (GSCA), Allianz SE publishes an annual Human Rights Policy Statement for the Allianz Group. This Statement covers our policies and due diligence approach on a wide range of human rights risks, including child labor, forced labor, and slavery. Until further regulatory clarification, Allianz will continue to publish, on the Allianz company website, an annual Modern Slavery Act Statement that complies with the relevant UK Act, even though the content is also covered in the GSCA Policy Statement.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\ndue diligence by sustainability experts and the involvement of central units such as the risk and communication departments.\n\nWhere an issue is detected and the (re)insurer/investor has leverage, engagement is encouraged to address and mitigate a potential human rights risk.\n\nIf no mitigation measures exist or if leverage cannot be increased, and the risk is determined to be unacceptable, Allianz declines to engage in the business transaction.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the **[Allianz Sustainability](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)  [Integration Framework](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)** and chapter \"02\" in our Sustainability Report 2023 on the **Allianz [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n#### **Objectives and actions: regulatory requirements**\n\n| Topic                      | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| German Supply<br>Chain Act | - Appropriate due diligence<br>processes for the own<br>operations and global<br>supply chain of Allianz SE,<br>with the objective to identify<br>and minimize human rights<br>risks and certain<br>environmental risks | -Risk analyses conducted in<br>own operations and supply<br>chain, using a risk-based<br>approach<br>- Group Human Rights Officer<br>monitored Allianz risk<br>management<br>- Human rights policy<br>statement published |\n\n## Employee matters\n\nAll employee mattersaremanagedby the People andCulture function at Allianz Group level and across all Allianz operating entities. The KPI tables in the following sections anticipate future CSRD requirements under ESRS S1 where applicable, indicated in the table name.\n\n\"We secure your future\" is our corporate purpose and living up to it starts with our 154,862[1](#page-85-0) (see table \"S1-6.1\") employees. Our Group People and Culture strategy is based on fulfilling this purpose and on our employer value proposition \"We care for tomorrow\", staying true to our brand promise of expressing confidence in tomorrow, and putting our customers at the center of what we do. This is what drives our decisions and actions and we do it in line with our people attributes: Entrepreneurship, Customer & Market Excellence, Trust, and Collaborative Leadership.\n\nOur ambition is to be the top employer in the financial services industry globally. We work to attract top talent and support our employees on their growth and development journey, delivering a strong business impact and making a positive social contribution wherever we operate.\n\nTo reach this ambition, we have based our People and Culture strategy on three pillars:\n\n- 1. The Employees and Candidates pillar includes all our strategic priorities that enable us to attract top talents and to engage, retain, and develop our employees. Strong employee engagement is important to us, and we foster a culture and working environment where people and performance matter. We ensure lifelong learning and are committed to growing and developing our people to be prepared for the future. Fair remuneration as well as health and safety for our employees are of utmost importance. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of flexible work options.\n- 2. The Business pillar includes our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) engagement and Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) initiative, which fuel our business to deliver on Allianz's strategic goals. We are committed to strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace by providing equal opportunities for all, fostering gender balance, and embracing a diverse workforce not only in terms of gender representation but also in terms of generations, disability, nationalities, ethnicities, religious beliefs, and LGBTQ+ identity. A diverse workforce enables us to better understand and fulfill the needs of our equally diverse customer base. Strategic Workforce Planning, on the other hand, aims to understand workforce development in response to global megatrends and how we can equip our workforce with the skills they need for today and for the future.\n- 3. The Brand and Society pillar displaysthe contribution our People and Culture function makes to business and society and that we create positive social impact. Our contribution is verified and acknowledged by external certificationslikeGreat Place toWork® (GPTW) and EDGE as well as global rankings like Refinitiv. Furthermore, we engage with the World Economic Forum, for instance, as a member of the Good Work Alliance for a more resilient,equitable, inclusive,andhumanefutureofwork.OurPeople\n\n<span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>and Culture operations contribute to generating sustainable and inclusive growth and help to deliver on U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 8, \"Decent work and Economic growth\".\n\nPolicies are instrumental in implementing our Group People and Culture strategy. We consider our established Allianz Corporate Rules as policies according to the ESRS' policy definition. At Allianz, we are committed to respecting the human rights outlined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the International Bill of Human Rights. Furthermore, Allianz explicitly supports the goal of observing and implementing the fundamental rights of these external charters. For further information, please refer to the section \"Compliance/anticorruption and bribery matters\",the section \"Collective bargaining and social dialogue\", and the section \"Human Rights in own workforce\".\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects our values and principles and thus guides our employees in their actions and decisions. How we act, how we operate, and the decisions that we make are focused on caring for each other and treating everyone fairly and with respect. The Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as the health and safety of our employees and clearly commits to a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination, bullying, or harassment. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the section \"Compliances/anti-corruption and bribery matters\".\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Human Resources (ASHR) establishes core rules and principles for People and Culture management, and it specifies the role of the respective Group People and Culture functions including professional, organizational, and procedural requirements. The People and Culture function is committed to these principles and acts as a service provider for the business. The Standard applies to the entire Allianz Group except Allianz Asset Management companies which are covered by separate standards aligning the general principles outlined in the ASHR. The following People and Culture topics are covered by the ASHR: Learning and development and performance management (for further information, please refer to the section \"Learning and development and performance management\")\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Contracted headcount working in companies fully covered under global People and Culture reporting standard.

The ASHR is reviewed once a year and considers interests of key stakeholders, particularly Allianz SE Group centers. Material changes must be approved by the respective Allianz SE Board Member in charge of People and Culture. The ASHR will be reviewed in 2024 and updated due to the requirements of CSRD and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, for instance.\n\nThe Allianz Group Remuneration Policy establishes the general and specific basic principles of the remuneration system. It defines processes related to performance evaluation, the remuneration system (including remuneration plans), and corresponding roles and responsibilities.\n\nCompliance with the Group Remuneration Policy is mandatory within the Allianz Group. The implementation of the policy is guided by the principle of proportionality, taking into account the nature of business, size, complexity, and regulation of the respective operating entity. This principle of proportionality only applies to the \"how\" and not to the \"if\" of the implementation.\n\nThe Group Remuneration Policy is reviewed once a year in accordance with the regulatory requirements under Solvency II and\n\n|                                                  | Employee matters section                               | Employee matters sub-section    | Targets and ambitions 20231                                                                                                            | Achievements1                                                                                                                                       | Targets and ambitions 20241                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1st Strategic Pillar<br>Employees/<br>Candidates | Engaging with our workforce                            | AES Survey                      | Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and<br>Work Well Index+ (WWI +) development<br>against previous year and overall ambition<br>level. | 81 % IMIX<br>76 % WWI +                                                                                                                             | Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) 75 % plus<br>and Work Well Index+ (WWI +)<br>development against previous year and<br>overall ambition level.                             |\n|                                                  | Learning and development and<br>performance management | Training and skills development |                                                                                                                                        | 50.01 hours/employee                                                                                                                                | 43 hours of learning on average per<br>employee p.a.                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                  |                                                        | Performance management          | 80 % of the Allianz executive2 population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan                                                    | 83.87 % of the Allianz executive2 population<br>with completed Personal Development Plan                                                            | 80 % of the Allianz executive population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan<br>60 % of the Allianz non-executive population<br>complete the Personal Development Plan |\n| 2nd Strategic Pillar<br>Business                 | Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)                 | Gender                          |                                                                                                                                        | Allianz Global Executives (AGE): 25.96 %<br>female<br>Allianz Senior Executives (ASE): 27.90 %<br>female<br>Allianz Executives (AE): 35.51 % female | Allianz Global Executives (AGE): 30 % female<br>Allianz Senior Executives (ASE): 30 % female<br>Allianz Executives (AE): 40 % female                                         |\n|                                                  |                                                        | Generations                     |                                                                                                                                        | 34.31 % employees < 35 years old                                                                                                                    | At least 25 % of our global workforce is                                                                                                                                     |\n\nStandards of Conduct, and membership of the Valuable 500.\n\napproved by the Allianz SE Board of Management.

Each operating entity concerned is obliged to provide a Statement of Accountability to the management of Allianz SE to confirm local implementation of the Group Remuneration Policy. Both the ASHR and the Group Remuneration Policy are published in the Allianz Corporate Rule Book. Our Allianz Functional Guidelines for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) describe our strategy, rationale, and principles for DEI. They show which targets and ambitions we have set ourselves, and how we implement and monitor those targets. In 2023, we published an update that includes our 2024 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion targets and ambitions. The Guidelines are applicable to the entire Allianz Group except Allianz Asset Management companies, which have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity. Our Functional Guidelines for DEI describe our commitments to the U.N. Women's Empowerment Principles, the U.N.

They have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity. 2\\_Liverpool Victoria General Insurance Group Limited, Guildford and Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited, Guildford are excluded from Allianz UK's data due to grading data unavailability for PDP.\n\nOur Allianz Global Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline outlines our global zero-tolerance standard against harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment) and discrimination. We encourage employees to speak up in line with our open communication and feedback culture and to use the Allianz Group's whistleblowing channels. For further information, please refer to the section \"Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\". To reflect important changes, both the Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI and the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline are updated by the respective departments and subsequently approved by the Group People and Culture Officer.\n\nAll mentioned policies are reviewed once a year. If one of the mentioned policies or single items within the policy are in conflict with local law or regulations, the local law or regulations will prevail.\n\nBeyond policies, it is crucial that targets and ambitions are implemented according to our Group People and Culture strategy.

This contracted headcount figure is the basis for the figures in the remainder of the section \"Employee matters\".\n\nThe metrics in the section \"Employee matters\" are collected centrally by Allianz Group People and Culture according to globally defined standards. Their definitions are documented in our People and Culture metrics definition handbook.\n\nThe split into the different business segments in tables \"S1-6.2\" and \"S1-6.4\" reflects the Allianz Group structure and ensures consistency throughout the report. For further information, please refer to [Business operations](#page-52-0) chapter. In addition, Germany as a country is displayed separately in accordance with CSRD requirements as it represents over 10% of the total contracted headcount.\n\nTable \"S1-6.3\" shows that the majority of our employees hold a permanent contract. Temporary contracts are sometimes offered to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made, to seasonal workers to meet customer demands, or to career entrants for summer internships in some operating entities. A minor part of our employees, for instance, those operating as medical professionals for Allianz or working students, are non-guaranteed hours employees. The majority of our active headcount are full-time employees, while some employees use the flexibility that Allianz offers to work part-time.

For further information, please refer to the **Allianz [company](https://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/ratings/business/human-rights.html)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/ratings/business/human-rights.html)**.\n\nAllianz SE, as the holding company of the Allianz Group, has been subject to the Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Act (GSCA)) since January 2023. The GSCA requires us to establish worldwide risk management systems concerning the human rights of our own employees and the employees of our suppliers, amongst others.\n\nIn our own operations, Allianz has established a risk management system that is designed to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks to the human rights of employees. Allianz will continue to further rollout and strengthen these processes over the course of 2024.\n\nAmong protected rights listed in the GSCA, the risk categories that are most relevant for our own operations are: occupational health and safety, equal treatment (which includes DEI and equal pay), freedom of association / collective bargaining, and adequate / living wages.\n\nIf risks are identified, we take preventive measures to mitigate those risks. If violations are found, Allianz is legally obliged to remedy them promptly. The effectiveness of measures is regularly reviewed.\n\nOur risk management system also encompasses an annual (public) [Policy Statement on Human Rights,](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz-SE_Human-Rights-Policy-Statement-2023.pdf) a global complaints mechanism (**[SpeakUp@Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html)**), independent monitoring through the Group Human Rights Officer, and an annual (public) report to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control.\n\nThe section \"1st Strategic Pillar: Employees and Candidates\" outlines the topics engaging with own workforce, learning and development and performance management, fair remuneration, benefits, social protection, health and safety, work-life balance, and collective bargaining and social dialogue.\n\n### **Engaging with own workforce**\n\nListening and engaging with our employees are the cornerstones of implementing our People and Culture strategy. The member of the Board of Management responsible for People and Culture is accountable for developing our framework for listening to employees and steering activities to ensure progress towards implementation of our ambition and reaching our ambitions. Operational responsibility is assigned to the Global People and Culture Officer and Local Human Resources Directors. Our employee listening framework consists of the annual Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) and biannual Pulse surveys.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe AES is our well-established employee platform for gathering employee feedback globally and has been in place since 2010. Our two key indicators recorded with the survey are the Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and the Work Well Index+ (WWI +). The IMIX measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter, meaning that we enable employees to unlock their full potential. The IMIX score is derived out of a basket of ten questions. In 2023, the IMIX increased by 2 percentage points to 81% (2022: 79%). Improvements in our IMIX scores demonstrate that we are making progress in the areas of leadership, performance, and corporate culture.\n\nThe WWI + measures employee well-being. A higher index score is associated with higher employee well-being. The WWI+ score rose by +5pp to 76% (2022: 71%). For further information, please refer to the section [\"Health and safety\".](#page-91-0)\n\nThese positive 2023 results were achieved against the backdrop of deteriorating scores of external global benchmarks. We consider these good results to be a positive reflection of our ongoing follow-up activity in the aftermath of the survey and our efforts to continuously enhance the employee experience. Each Allianz entity thoroughly analyzes its results to gain an in-depth insight and agree on effective action plans with their teams. In addition, we expanded our global Engagement Matters program in 2023. This initiative provides frameworks of measures to increase employee engagement, offering support to all entities in identifying initiatives to implement on a global and local level in response to the feedback received. The focus areas identified are connected locally and globally so that Allianz operating entities can work on impactful measures.\n\nThe AES results are directly linked to the performance targets of the Allianz Board of Management. We aim to achieve an IMIX score above 75%and WWI+ development against previous year and overall ambition level in 2024.\n\nOur global Pulse surveys constitute the second employee listening channel. Pulse surveys took place in the first and second quarters of 2023 to check the impact of engagement plans and ask our employees about focus topics including Sustainability, Health and Safety, Personal Development and Risk Culture.\n\nOur efforts in engaging with our employees have been recognized with awards and certifications. In 2023, we proudly achieved GPTW certifications at 43 entities across 26 countries, marking a substantial leap from 15 entities certified in 2022. Allianz also reached a commendable 82% in the Trust Index and further narrowed the gap to the 86% score required for Top 25 World's Best Workplaces. Moving forward, our ambition is to increase the number of GPTW-certified entities as well as the number of OEs on the National Best Workplace lists.\n\nFor further information on our processes for engaging with our workforce, please refer to the section [\"Collective bargaining and social](#page-92-0)  [dialogue\"](#page-92-0).\n\n### **Learning and development and performance management**\n\nThis section addresses the strategic sub-section Training and skills development including Performance management.\n\n#### **Training and skills development**\n\nLearning and development is a key differentiator in the financial services industry where customer need are constantly changing in response to a rapidly evolving external context, as observed in various industries. Our ambition is for employees to develop skills for today and for the future to ensure Allianz is prepared for emerging trends and opportunities and able to attract the best talent.\n\nAllianz fosters personal, professional, and leadership skills, as well as digital skills and technical expertise, and emphasizes the development of EQ (emotional quotient, such as curiosity, resilience, \"we mentality\", and flexibility) as well as IQ (intelligence quotient, such as digital and data, problem-solving and business, sustainability, and leadership) skills. Allianz is committed globally to employee lifelong learning and development.\n\nTo live up to this commitment, we offer global learning through our global #learn initiative. We have set up programs targeted to key areas, such as property and casualty, life and health, IT, strategy, finance, sustainability, communications, market management, and operations. Allianz operating entities have access to global and local offers as part of their broader action plans to support employee learning and development.\n\nA special focus in 2023 was put on the topics of IT, data, and artificial intelligence. We offered generative AI and ChatGPT training to all managers with the aim of explaining the new technology to Allianz leaders and in order to develop relevant use cases for Allianz. More than a thousand managers took part in the training between October and December 2023. Additionally, we held the inaugural global Fit4IT day in 40 operating entities, covering approximately 85% of employees. Our employees were able to invest half a day in upskilling, familiarizing themselves with various IT tools.\n\nWe are also proud of our Allianz Sustainability Training for all our employees which covers the basics on sustainability – why it is important and what Allianz is doing to integrate sustainability into our business model – and offers inspiration on how employees can contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nWe employ a wide range of learning and development approaches including on-the-job learning, mentoring and coaching, classroom trainings, peer circles, and digital learning. We encourage employee learning in all formats, and all are included in the learning hours reported. The total hours reported in table \"S1-13.1\" thusinclude self-directed learning (such as videos and podcasts) as well as other, alternative, learning formats (such as coaching), which together account for 32.08% of total learning hours.\n\nWe have a strong focus on digital learning. Through our digital learning ecosystem, employees are able to source learning both from our AllianzU learning platform powered by Degreed and LinkedIn Learning. Our internally developed global learning offers are available in five languages and are available to all employees. Learning consumption is measured globally on a monthly basis.\n\nDeveloping our leaders is of the utmost importance to us. We run five global programs every year to develop strong leaders:\n\n- − #lead Ignite is targeted at new people leaders who qualify as potential or new Allianz executives. It aims to equip them with the knowledge, mindset, and skills needed to lead at Allianz.\n- − #lead Empower develops the leadership capabilities needed for leaders at the future and recently identified Allianz Senior Executive level to make the transition from leading teams to leading leaders and the business.\n- − #lead Transform was created for future and recently appointed top executives. The program is built around our core #lead mindsets: curiosity, resilience, \"we-mentality\", and flexibility.\n- − #lead Accelerator prepares future and current board members for leading the organization with strategic project work, board exposure, peer coaching, and external insights.\n- − #sheleads sets the standard for effective gender balance via sponsorship, peer coaching, and learning sessions with our alumni community. The program enables our female leaders to make their next career move.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the global programs, all leaders are encouraged to obtain the Allianz Leadership Passport, which is the \"license\" to be a people leader at Allianz globally. The program sets minimum standards for all people leaders, with an equal focus on hard and soft skills, for our leaders to balance IQ and EQ. After obtaining their Leadership Passport, leaders must refresh their passports on a yearly basis by undertaking further training. Monitoring and reporting on the take up of the #lead passport as well as the five global programs is managed globally by Group People and Culture. We monitor usage and learning consumption on a monthly basis.\n\nTo achieve our commitment to employee lifelong learning, Allianz set the global target of a yearly minimum average of 43 hours of training per employee by 2024. In 2023, our employees learned on average for 50.01 hours, as reported in table \"S1-13.1\". Additionally, a commitment to lifelong learning is included in the Board of Management targets for 2024. To support strong performance in current and future responsibilities, employee upskilling and development, we offer them a minimum of one hour working time per week dedicated to training.\n\nThe training hours per employee metric is monitored on a quarterly basis.\n\n#### **Average training hours per employee, broken down by gender (S1-13.1)**\n\n| As of 31 December               | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------|-------|\n| Average training hours1         | 50.01 |\n| Female                          | 47.52 |\n| Male                            | 52.67 |\n| Not reported as female or male2 | 69.99 |\n\n1\\_Calculated as a ratio of total training hours divided by active headcount. 2\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n#### **Performance management**\n\nAt Allianz, we are committed to developing and growing our people, including through performance management. Our performance management aims both to enhance the employees' individual performance and to align their priorities with Allianz's corporate purpose and strategic business goals. Setting priorities properly and conducting regular check-ins enables employees to let their full potential unfold, which in turn helps Allianz achieve its business ambitions. Performance management is an ongoing, continuous process of communicating on-the-job priorities, performance expectations, and development goals.\n\nThe framework for Performance Management is implemented within the Allianz Group, documented in the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe global People and Culture template on our leading People and Culture IT system enables the consistent application of the key steps making up the performance management cycle. The template is available to both the executive and non-executive employee populations. Execution and outcomes of the Performance Management process are subject to local legal regulations and respective governance bodies, e.g., local or global Compensation Committees.\n\nThe key steps of the Performance Management Process at Allianz can be described as follows:\n\n- − Priority setting is the initial kick-off of the annual performance management cycle and refers to setting clear, transparent, outcome-oriented, and flexible goals to be achieved throughout the year while giving guidance on desired behaviors.\n- − Mid-year check-in is the time to request and provide feedback for the first half of the year. Line manager and employee reflect on priorities and behaviors, and agree on joint measures to continuously improve performance through development opportunities on the job and off the job. Mid-year check-in is supported by our Multi-Rater feedback process. The Multi-Rater feedback is a tool for getting 360-degree feedback from colleagues. It is mandatory for Allianz's executive population, whereas implementation for the non-executive population is subject to the local rules and regulations of our operating entities. Based on the \"People Attributes\", Multi-Rater provides employees with valuable insights into their strengths and developmental areas.\n- − The Personal Development Plan (PDP) lays out the employee's yearly development goals. Employees are expected to agree with their manager on their individual development measures, usually during the mid-year review discussion. The PDP helps the employee record and track progress towards their own development goals. The 2023 target of 80% PDP completion by the Allianz executive population was achieved, as displayed in table \"S1-13.2\". The same target is set for 2024. For the Allianz non-executive population, the 2024 target is a 60% PDP completion rate.\n- − Year-End-Review is the assessment of individual performance of an employee by the line manager at the end of each year. The assessment is based on a 3-point rating scale: below, at, or above\n\ntarget. The overall individual performance of an employee is reflected in the Individual Performance Assessment.\n\n- − Performance and Talent Dialogue is a calibration of an employee's individual performance on the basis of crosscomparison within the relevant population. This ensures the application of consistent performance standards and an appropriate level of differentiation with close attention to nondiscrimination of employees in any regard.\n- − Communication of final Individual Performance Assessment is the feedback discussion between the line manager and employee, which normally takes place in 1Q of the following year and seeks a common understanding of accomplishments and development opportunities.\n\n#### **Allianz Executives and levels above3,4 (AE+) with a Personal Development Plan (PDP), broken down by gender (S1-13.2)** in %\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2023  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                                                  |       |\n| Executives with a PDP1                                                                                             | 83.87 |\n| % of male executives with a PDP out of all male executives                                                         | 83.31 |\n| % of female executives with a PDP out of all female executives                                                     | 84.94 |\n| % of not reported as female or male executives with a PDP out of<br>all executives not reported as female or male2 | -     |\n\n1\\_Includes all executive positions (Allianz Global Executive Positions, Allianz Senior Executive Positions, and Allianz Executive Positions).\n\n2\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n3\\_Allianz Asset Management companies excluded from global reporting of AE and ASE cluster as Allianz Global Grading System is not applicable to them.\n\n4\\_Liverpool Victoria General Insurance Group Limited, Guildford and Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited, Guildford are excluded from Allianz UK's data due to grading data unavailability for PDP.\n\n### **Fair remuneration, benefits, and social protection**\n\nThis section summarizes the topic of Adequate Wages and outlines the strategic topic Fair remuneration. Furthermore, we will address the topics Benefits and Social Protection.\n\n#### **Adequate wages**\n\nIn accordance with the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy, internal and external benchmarking is performed to ensure appropriateness of (individual) remuneration and general pay levels. Allianz expects all operating entities to follow the principles described in the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Fair remuneration**\n\nAllianz is committed to equity and fairness as defined in our Allianz Group Code of Conduct. This includes ensuring Allianz operating entities enforce equal pay for equal work in the same or comparable roles for all genders. This principle is outlined in our Allianz Group Remuneration Policy. An annual global equal pay review across the organization identifies equal pay gaps which can be mitigated with appropriate action.\n\nIn addition to equal pay, there is also a gender pay gap to be considered. This consists of the difference in average remuneration between men and women across a whole organization, irrespective of role or seniority. If one gender is more represented in higher paid, senior roles in one organization, for example, there will be a gender pay gap. Allianz takes several actions to foster gender equity in representation and thus close the gender pay gap. One important action is the ambition to have higher female representation in senior positions. To reach our gender representation targets, we monitor the percentage of our female employees on a quarterly basis and implement concrete actions towards target achievement. We also foster best practice exchange among operating entities to drive gender equality in representation (see also the section \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\").\n\nTo measure our progress towards equity and fairness and to continue to move forward on our journey, in 2021 we launched the EDGE (Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) certification process for our insurance business segment and several global lines, currently covering 73% of the Allianz Group's global headcount. EDGE is the leading standard for diversity, equity, and inclusion and monitors companies' progress on gender equality against established criteria, including equal pay. We are proud that Allianz has been recertified by EDGE in 2023.\n\n#### **Benefits**\n\nReward and recognition at Allianz go beyond remuneration. Allianz also supports its employees around the world with attractive benefits. This shows that we care about employees' Health, Money, Career, and Time and support them to find professional and personal fulfillment.\n\nOur Global Benefits Strategy for the insurance business is structured around these four pillars. We introduced minimum standards for benefits available to employees across Allianz in 1Q 2023, and we expect our global rebranding and communication campaign to further increase the transparency and visibility of Allianz benefits among employees in 2024.\n\nBenefits take economic, environmental, and social factors into account, and incentives are oriented towards creating long-term value and financial protection. The Allianz Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) for instance offers employees Allianz shares at favorable conditions in 43 countries, allowing them to benefit from the success of the company and its long-term performance. As a token of appreciation for meeting previous year Group targets, Allianz offered one Allianz Free Share – or its cash equivalent in countries that do not offer the ESPP – to employees globally in 2023.\n\nFor further information on employee benefits, please refer to our **[People Fact Book 2023](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)** and our **[Global recruiting homepage](https://careers.allianz.com/)**.\n\n#### **Social protection**\n\nWe operate in countries where our employees have at least access to social protection programs against loss of income due to major life events: sickness, unemployment, employment injury, parental leave, and retirement. In countries where social protection is not provided through public social security schemes, we aim to close potential gaps through additional offerings. Best practice examples are our entities in the United States, where Allianz provides health insurance benefits, or India, where we provide paternity, and carer leave options.[1](#page-91-1)\n\n### <span id=\"page-91-0\"></span>**Health and safety**\n\nThe health, safety, physical, and mental well-being of our employees is a top priority. We aim to sustain and improve employee health and well-being across our global workforce. Two key levers to achieve this ambition are our Minimum Health Requirements and our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system.\n\nThe four Minimum Health Requirements are:\n\n- <span id=\"page-91-1\"></span>1. Professional Support: Allianz offers employees 24/7 free of charge access to professional psychological support through Employee Assistance Programs.\n- 2. Leadership Enablement: Allianz offers targeted health and wellbeing training for people leaders, through both the #lead program and other platforms to ensure managers are equipped with the knowledge to sustain employee health and well-being as well as to strengthen resilience in their teams.\n- 3. Employee Feedback: Employees have the opportunity to give once a year feedback on their health and well-being through global surveys, such as Pulse surveys. For further information, please refer to the section \"Engaging with own workforce\".\n- 4. Focus Time: Meeting-free calendar days have been introduced to provide most employees with time to focus on their work.\n\nThe four Minimum Health Requirements are reinforced by the \"Agreement on Guidelines concerning Work Related Stress and Minimum Health Requirements\" between the Allianz SE and the (European) SE Works Council of Allianz SE. It applies to Allianz SE and its subsidiaries with registered offices in the Member States of the E.U., the contracting states of the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland. All best endeavors will be made to adopt the minimum health requirements across the Allianz Group, where national legislation does not prevent this.\n\nThe minimum health requirements were monitored regularly and reported to both management and employee representatives once a year, which shows our commitment to the well-being of our global workforce.\n\nTo effectively manage OHS matters, most local Allianz entities have furthermore implemented OHS management systems. They include OHS risk and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to mitigate these risks as well as emergency actions. Internal inspections take place frequently and progress in reducing and preventing health issues and risks is assessed against targets on a regular basis. This includes procedures to investigate work-related injuries, ill health, diseases, and incidents. Our workforce is trained regularly to raise awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents.\n\nThe health and safety of our global workforce is measured via our Work Well Index+ (WWI +) and other KPIs.\n\n1\\_The following major exceptions apply: Unemployment benefits are not available for non-citizens in Malaysia and Taiwan who are usually expats covered by their home countries' social welfare benefits. In a few countries, unemployment benefits are excluded in case of self-termination of work contract, for example in Croatia or in Türkiye. In Singapore and Hong Kong unemployment benefits are generally not part of the social security system.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Work Well Index+: To track well-being globally, we refer to the WWI+ index, which monitors the progress of health and well-being throughout the organization. We also use pulse check surveys to check in with employees during the year. For further information, please refer to the section \"Engaging with own workforce\".\n- − Regular monitoring of further health and safety indicators: Local Employee Assistance Program providers perform quarterly monitoring of additional indicators, which are reported to the Allianz Board of Management on a semiannual basis. Finally, CSRD-compliant KPIs, covering work-related injuries, ill health, accidents, fatalities, and days lost (see table S1-14) are monitored annually and serve as a point of reference for the health, safety, and well-being of our global workforce.\n\n#### **Health and safety (S1-14)**\n\n|                                                                                      | Unit                             | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                    |                                  |        |\n| Number of fatalities related to work-related<br>injuries/ill health                  | #                                | 1      |\n| Number of recordable work-related accidents                                          | #                                | 842    |\n| Rate of recordable work-related accidents                                            | Per one<br>million<br>work hours | 3.72   |\n| Cases of recordable work-related ill health¹                                         | #                                | 355    |\n| Number of days lost to work-related injuries/<br>fatalities/ accidents/ ill health¹² | #                                | 16,665 |\n|                                                                                      |                                  |        |\n\n1\\_The data of reporting unit Allianz Partners Service is not included in cases of recordable workrelated ill-health and number of days lost to work-related injuries/fatalities/accidents/ill health. 2\\_Globally, where national legislation or local culture/ norms do not prevent this.\n\n### **Work-life balance**\n\nThis section covers Flexible working options and the Family-related leave topic.\n\n### **Flexible working**\n\nAllianz offers a wide range of offerings. For us, hybrid working combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of mobile working with the benefits of targeted collaboration and in-person connection. Flexible work options are key for talent attraction and employee engagement, while regular in-person touch points help us foster team spirit, co-creation, and cross-team exchange.\n\nMost of our employees across the globe have the opportunity to spend a minimum of 40% of their working hours working from outside the office. Our global minimum offering provides a lot of empowerment, trust, and flexibility to our local teams to decide what works best for their customers, their business, and their teams. The flexible work offerings therefore differ in our operating entities but for all of them customer centricity and customer needs are the north star.\n\nWe track the actual employee time that was spent working outside the Allianz offices on a biannual basis and collect employee feedback in our AES survey. The survey results show that flexible work has been one of the positive drivers for employee engagement in 2023.\n\nFor further information on further flexible work options, please refer to our People Fact Book 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### **Family-related leave**\n\nBeing a parent and caring for family members are important responsibilities. Our Allianz employees deserve support in fulfilling these roles and keeping a positive work-life balance. Allianz is committed to supporting parents and families by offering childcare facilities, leisure activities, emergency assistance, and other family services. Family-related leave is specific to countries and usually covers maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers' leave. Allianz adheres to all statutory requirements in the countries we operate in and aims to exceed those standards where possible and appropriate.\n\n#### **Work-life balance metrics (S1-15)**\n\nIn %\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                      | 2023  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Employees entitled to take family-related leave (share of total<br>employees)          | 99.00 |\n| Employees that took family-related leave (share of entitled<br>employees)              | 8.50  |\n| Male (share of employees that took family-related leave)                               | 32.78 |\n| Female (share of employees that took family-related leave)                             | 67.00 |\n| Not reported as female or male (share of employees that took<br>family-related leave)1 | 0.10  |\n| 1 Comprises non-binary and not reported.                                               |       |\n\n### <span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>**Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue**\n\nWe aim to ensure that employee rights are protected across all Allianz operating entities. Allianz was one of the first companies to create pan-European worker participation standards and to establish a European SE Works Council under the legislation for Societas Europaea (SE) companies (an agreement concerning the participation of employees in Allianz SE).\n\nThrough this body and the regular dialogue between management and employee representatives and their trade unions, Allianz ensures effective representation of all its employees at European level. Our (European) Works Council Executive Committee is evidence that Allianz endorses the establishment of employee representatives in its Group companies and welcomes their cooperation with the trade unions.\n\nEmployee representation is widespread across Europe. The right of workers to establish workers' representative bodies and thus negotiate working conditions is guaranteed by law in many jurisdictions. The mandate of workers' representatives and the role of the employer in regard to collective bargaining and the social dialogue is very much shaped by local legal requirements.\n\nAllianz supports the principles enshrined in the ILO (International Labour Organization) core conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. In countries where those principles have been enshrined in local law, we fully respect and implement local rules on trade unions and worker representation. In countries that have not ratified the relevant ILO conventions, we respect the primacy of local laws and look for ways to allow our employees to organize and voice their interests vis-à-vis management. Globally, the percentage of Allianz's workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements is 48.46%.\n\nAccording to CSRD reporting requirements, \"coverage\" includes the number of employees to whom the companies concerned are obliged to apply the collective agreements. Irrespective of the obligation, there are a large number of companies that apply the collective agreements and provisions on a voluntary basis.\n\nWe work closely with employee representatives (members of the (European) SE Works Council's Executive Committee and employee representatives on the supervisory board of Allianz SE) to support change implementation, manage impacts on employees, and promote opportunities. The \"social dialogue\" is our pan-European forum that has existed for over a decade. It supports the progress of our business strategy, our agenda, and our response to the increased pace of change in topics such as the digital revolution. Discussions in 2023 included the [Strategic Workforce Planning](#page-94-0) program.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue (S1-8)**\n\n| Collective Bargaining Coverage |                  |                                                                                                       | Social Dialogue                            |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Coverage<br>Rate               | Employees - EEA1 | Employees -<br>Non-EEA2                                                                               | Workplace<br>representation<br>(EEA only)1 |\n| 0-19 %                         | -                | Corporate and<br>Other3                                                                               | -                                          |\n| 20-39 %                        | -                | Asia Pacific                                                                                          | -                                          |\n| 40-59 %                        | -                | Global Insurance<br>Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Iberia &<br>Latin America,<br>Middle East and<br>Africa | -                                          |\n| 60-79 %                        | Germany4         | -                                                                                                     | -                                          |\n| 80-100 %                       | -                | -                                                                                                     | Germany4                                   |\n\n1\\_For countries with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n\n2\\_For business segments with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n\n3\\_For further information on Corporate and Other (incl.

We further describe the Strategic Workforce Planning topic.\n\n### **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**\n\nDiversity is a core element of our culture. Our customers are diverse, and in order to best understand and serve them, our workforce needs to be diverse, too. We believe that diverse teams create better results, show higher resilience, and are more innovative and more productive, provided they can act in an environment where everyone can be themselves and unique views are appreciated. Being both diverse and inclusive has a positive impact on our business.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening inclusion in our workplace, by ensuring equal opportunities for all, and shaping a diverse workforce along five DEI dimensions: gender, people with disabilities, nationalities/ethnicities, generations, and LGBTQ+. With our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI and our Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Functional Guideline, we aim to ensure that across our operating entities and functions there is no discrimination for reasons including gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, physical or mental abilities, religious beliefs, or social background.\n\nAt Allianz, we want to achieve our targets and ambitions for our DEI dimensions in a sustainable manner. The key to this is an inclusive workplace environment. We have multiple actions in place to strengthen our inclusive workplace environment, such as:\n\n- − Global Inclusion Council: Our Global Inclusion Council (GIC) sets the DEI strategy and plays a crucial role in driving initiatives to achieve our targets and ambitions, in integrating DEI into the business and monitoring progress. The GIC has been in place since 2007 and consists of more than 20 Allianz senior managers from operating entities, Allianz Group Center representatives, and the leads of our five global employee networks for DEI which leads to 81 local network chapters.\n- − DEI Employee Networks: Employee networks enable us to engage with our employees. They help us to raise awareness, support employees, advocate for change, and shape the agenda for DEI. We have five global employee networks: \"Allianz NEO\" for gender inclusion, \"Allianz Beyond\" for disability inclusion, \"Allianz GRACE\" for ethnicity and cultural inclusion, \"Allianz Engage\" for generational inclusion, and \"Allianz Pride\" for LGBTQ+ inclusion. 15 new networks operating locally were added in 2023.\n- − DEI as part of daily business Mentoring Campaign: At Allianz, DEI is integrated into the way we conduct business. Our global Mentoring Campaign #KeepExploring, which took place throughout 2023, championed an intersectional approach featuring personal experiences of employees presenting more than one diversity dimension, e.g. combining different generations with nationalities, and/or genders.\n\nGlobal People and Culture monitor the development of our targets and ambitions on a regular basis and report progress to the Allianz Board of Management on a semi-annual basis (for gender, this is done on a quarterly basis). Additionally, we support operating entities in setting up their individual local action plans to reach DEI targets and foster best practice exchange.\n\nThe achievements of our DEI strategy are recognized by external global awards and rankings. For example, Refinitiv – a global Diversity and Inclusion Index – identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies <span id=\"page-93-0\"></span>with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces. In 2023, Allianz was ranked #1 in the Insurance industry and #1 in Germany across all industries. Our reputation as a DEI leader strengthens Allianz's brand as a trusted provider of financial services.\n\nFor further information on DEI targets and ambitions, see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### **Gender**\n\nAt Allianz, we have already attained overall numerical gender parity in our workforce with 80,949 female and 73,884 male employees. We are committed to equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, and put measures in place to see this reflected in the staffing of leadership positions. As outlined in our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI[1](#page-93-0), our 2024 targets are to have 30% women in Allianz Global Executive positions, and 30% women in Allianz Senior Executive positions. In addition, we aim to have 40% women in Allianz Executive positions and 50% women in our talent pools. For further information, please refer to section the \"Fair remuneration\". Allianz NEO, our employee network for gender inclusion currently has 20 local networks in place. Allianz NEO focuses on helping to find concrete improvement opportunities, creating dialogue and allyship, and endorsing new perspectives and novel working models for both women and men.\n\n#### **Generations**\n\nWith five different generations currently working together at Allianz, we are committed to leveraging the combined strengths, individual skills, and experiences of all generations. We aim to have a balanced generational representation, where GenZ and GenY (employees under 35) represent at least 25% of our global workforce. As of the end of 2023, 34.31% of our global workforce (see table S1-9.2) is younger than 35, which ensures a balanced generational representation.\n\nOur efforts for age inclusion are strongly supported by Allianz Engage, our employee network for generational diversity with 11 local networks in place. Through Allianz Engage, our employees are invited to proactively contribute to a company culture where the knowledge of all generations is called upon, for example, through mentoring. In the AllianzGroup, we have more than 700 mutual mentoring arrangements in place, allowing people from different generations to enter into mentoring partnerships to connect and to share knowledge, experiences, skills and perspectives in a genuine learning exchange beneficial for everyone involved.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_The Guidelines including any targets stated therein do not apply to Allianz Asset Management companies, which have their own initiatives to promote equal opportunity.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (S1-9.1)**\n\n| As of 31 December                            | 2023  |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                              | #     | %     |\n| Gender distribution                          | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz SE Supervisory Board              | 12    | -     |\n| Male                                         | 7     | 58.33 |\n| Female                                       | 5     | 41.67 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz SE Board of Management            | 9     | -     |\n| Male                                         | 6     | 66.67 |\n| Female                                       | 3     | 33.33 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Executive positions (top management)2     | 6,788 | -     |\n| Male                                         | 4,461 | 65.72 |\n| Female                                       | 2,327 | 34.28 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Global Executive (AGE) positions  | 235   | 3.46  |\n| Male                                         | 174   | 74.04 |\n| Female                                       | 61    | 25.96 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Senior Executive (ASE) positions3 | 803   | 11.83 |\n| Male                                         | 579   | 72.10 |\n| Female                                       | 224   | 27.90 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n| in Allianz Executive (AE) positions3         | 5,750 | 84.71 |\n| Male                                         | 3,708 | 64.49 |\n| Female                                       | 2,042 | 35.51 |\n| Not reported as female or male1              | -     | -     |\n\n1\\_Comprises non-binary and not reported.\n\n2\\_Includes all executive positions (Allianz Global Executive Positions, Allianz Senior Executive Positions, and Allianz Executive Positions).\n\n3\\_Allianz Asset Management companies excluded from global reporting of AE and ASE cluster as Allianz Global Grading System is not applicable to them.\n\n### **Age distribution (S1-9.2)**\n\n| As of 31 December                  | 2023   |       |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n|                                    | #      | %     |\n| Age distribution1                  |        |       |\n| Share of employees < 30 years old  | 28,757 | 19.13 |\n| Share of employees 30-50 years old | 82,598 | 54.93 |\n| Share of employees > 50 years old  | 39,004 | 25.94 |\n| Share of employees < 35 years old  | 51,595 | 34.30 |\n\n1\\_Age distribution is calculated based on active headcount, excluding, e.g., employees with a dormant employment relationship (for example due to sabbatical leave, in military or civilian service, or on parental leave).\n\n### **Persons with disabilities**\n\nAllianz Functional Guidelines for DEI explicitly outline that we prioritize the well-being of all our employees and work hard to ensure that our processes and workplaces are equally accessible to everyone, irrespective of their disability status.\n\nAllianz Beyond, our employee network for disability inclusion, currently has 12 local networks in place, with three local networks launched in 2023. It focuses on raising awareness of disability inclusion, identifying ways to make Allianz more accessible (physically and digitally). It also aims at creating a safe space for employees to disclose their disability and voice their workplace assistance needs in order to perform at their best. And it promotes Allianz externally as an attractive employer for people with disabilities.\n\nAllianz has been a Valuable 500 member since 2020 and is committed to increasing transparency on disabilities in the corporate landscape through increased disclosure. As an Iconic Leader, Allianz played a crucial role in the identification and definition of five Valuable 500 Disability Inclusion KPIs. These were announced at the World Economic Forum in 2023 and cover five dimensions: Workforce Representation, Goals, Training, Employee Resource Groups, and Digital Accessibility. Allianz reports on the Valuable 500 Disability Inclusion KPIs in our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)** and is working with Valuable 500 to secure commitment from other members to disclose Disability Inclusion KPIs and ultimately grant people with disabilities more equity in the workplace.\n\nAllianz has been a trusted partner of the Paralympic Movement since 2006 and became the first international partner of the International Paralympics Committee (IPC) in 2011. Through our continuous support, we recognize the athleticism and professionalism of Paralympians. Our efforts have a positive impact on career opportunities for people with disabilities, including through career fairs for Paralympic and Olympic athletes, with tangible results, leading to the hiring of 27 Paralympians and Olympians. For further information, see also our People Fact Book 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/about-us/who-we-are/documents/Allianz-People-Fact-Book-2023.pdf)**.\n\nAllianz is committed to strengthening its inclusive workplace culture for its entire global workforce, including employees with disabilities. For more details regarding our local ambitions, please see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/diversity/Allianz%20DEI%20Booklet%202023.pdf)**.\n\n### <span id=\"page-94-0\"></span>**Strategic Workforce Planning**\n\nAllianz has implemented Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) to create transparency on upcoming workforce developments. SWP compares workforce supply by cluster of job profiles (called Talent Segments) against projected workforce demand over the next five years. At Allianz, this is a structured yearly process that is integrated into the annual planning cycle. The result goes far beyond providing transparency on possible recruiting gaps. We are able to steer the mix of roles that we need in our workforce in order to implement Allianz strategies and fulfil our future vision. SWP provides a quantitative assessment of the resources required for ongoing transformations and indicates how our workforce can be equipped with the skills they need to remain employable in the future.\n\nThis global transparency allows us to decide what to focus our work on and customize solutions for up- and reskilling as well as retention and recruiting. SWP currently covers approximately 85% of our 2023 employee population. Global monitoring and steering using SWP KPIs ensures the implementation of Strategic Workforce Planning and maximizes its value within the business functions.\n\nGood working conditions along with equal treatment and equal opportunities for all are the basis for the CSRD convergence approach discussed in this Employee matters section. These subjects are an integral part of our brand value and societal commitments, as reflected in our ratings.\n\nOur positive social impact is verified and acknowledged by external certifications and global rankings (for further information, please refer to Great Place to Work certification in the section \"Processes to engage with own workforce\", EDGE certification in the section \"Fair remuneration\", and Refinitiv in the section \"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\"). Beyond certifications and rankings, Allianz is a member of the Valuable 500 and a trusted partner of the International Paralympics Committee (for further information, please \n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nrefer to section \"Persons with disabilities\"). Allianz is a member of the World Economic Forum Good Work Alliance; for more information, please refer to the **[Good Work Alliance website](https://initiatives.weforum.org/good-work-alliance/home)**. We are committed to human rights (for further information, please refer to the section \"Human Rights in own workforce\"), the U.N. Charter, U.N. SDGs, as well as our external certifications, rankings, and partnerships.\n\nFor further information on our social positioning, please refer to section \"Corporate Citizenship\".\n\n# Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\nThis section describes the impact of ethics, responsible business, and compliance matters on the Allianz Group´s activities. Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group´s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by Allianz Group Compliance.\n\nOur Compliance Management System helps to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\n\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2023, the Compliance Function continued to develop the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to meet the scope, and confirm compliance with global programs and local specificities. While CARE is primarily a challenged self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with Compliance Reviews of operating entities that are completed and coordinated by Allianz Group Compliance. Compliance Reviews are completed on a risk-based, three-yearly cycle.\n\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews, which assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust and Sales Compliance. This multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy has several benefits. First, operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Second, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide, and – if necessary – enforce remedial activities. Finally, people can learn from local and Group best practices, which further reinforces our compliance culture.\n\nAn online compliance management tool provides an overview of issues detected during the above activities. Users are required to use the tool to report and document actions taken to mitigate and follow up on any issues identified.\n\nThe information gathered is the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee is chaired by Allianz Group Compliance. This committee reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and the Allianz Group Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\n\nAs part of our Global Compliance Program, we follow international standards and applicable laws in relation to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz-specific rules.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. The current version of the Allianz Group Code of Conduct was approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management in 2020. New joiners at Allianz are informed of their obligation to adhere to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct. The key principles addressed by the Allianz Group Code of Conduct and the accompanying training are mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\nAllianz has zero tolerance of fraud. We are committed to complying with all applicable anti-fraud, anti-bribery, and anticorruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nZero tolerance applies regardless of who benefits from the fraud – Allianz as a company, other internal parties (employees, tied agents, intermediaries) or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz. To protect against fraud, we will take prompt and appropriate action where necessary – against employees, others acting on behalf of Allianz or third parties. This includes appropriately protecting customer and third-party data.\n\nSimilarly, Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving anything of value (anything monetary or nonmonetary that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain an improper personal or business advantage.\n\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report concerns and have multiple channels for doing so. These include via management, speaking directly with Allianz Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\n\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html) [company website](https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/compliance/voice-your-concerns.html)**. Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented, and managed according to internal guidelines and with strict confidentiality. The Allianz Group has specific procedures in place to ensure that no retaliation measures are taken against whistleblowers; reflecting our commitment to enable a healthy SpeakUp culture within the company. Retaliation measures are not accepted in any form.\n\nGroup Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign to remind employees of the avenues available for reporting.\n\n#### **Objectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters**\n\n| Topic      | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Progress and actions 2023                |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Compliance | Continue to enhance the<br>effectiveness of local<br>compliance organizations by<br>enriching our compliance<br>reviews, to further bolster<br>the governance and<br>processes of underlying<br>compliance organizations<br>across our OEs. | 2023 Compliance Review<br>Plan executed. |\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is a \"green\" classification system that translates the EU's environmental objectives into criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. The EU Taxonomy Regulation came into effect in 2020 and Allianz is reporting Taxonomy-eligibility for the third year in a row; however, Taxonomy-alignment is reported from the financial year 2023 onwards (described subsequently) only. The EU Taxonomy Regulation intends to provide increased transparency for stakeholders.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, the EU Commission published a guidance on Art. 8 EU Taxonomy Regulation. The document was assessed by Allianz but could not be fully considered for the 2023 reporting.[1](#page-96-0) Details about the implemented changes can be found in the respective subchapters.\n\n### **Allianz's approach to Sustainable Solutions in the Property and Casualty insurance business**\n\nWe are regarding the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the broader context of sustainable insurance solutions and are consequently reporting on it in combination with our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\nIt is an integral part of our strategy to not only insure our customers against risks, but also to support them in their challenges of a world which is about to transition to a more sustainable way of living and doing business. We aim to create real world impact through our business activities and contribute to ESG objectives based on science and in line with regulatory requirements and international agreements. This is based on the understanding that propertycasualty (P&C) insurance can support multiple ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation. The role of the insurance industry is not limited to the classic role as risk managers but goes beyond and includes the public expectations to accelerate a fair and just transition of economies and societies.\n\nTherefore, we have established a comprehensive framework for Allianz Sustainable Solutions, including guidelines, screening criteria and definitions, a certification grid, governance, and defined processes to safeguard us against greenwashing risks, provide strategic guidance to explore business opportunities, and take corporate responsibility for our planet.\n\nUnder the Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework, the Technical Screening Criteria (Annex 2, 10.1, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139) (Climate Delegated Act) supplementing the EU Taxonomy Regulation) serve as minimum requirements to qualify products as sustainable. Simultaneously, the Technical Screening Criteria are used as guidance for our product development with the objective to increase the resilience of our insurance activities and support our customers in building adaptive capacity.\n\nIn 2023, the first year of Taxonomy-alignment reporting, we have been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and have started developing and implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy Regulation for non-life insurance business: Underwriting of climate-related perils**\n\nFor non-life insurance activities, the Climate Delegated Act has established \"climate change adaptation\" as (the only) potential substantial contribution to environmental objectives as laid out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Climate Delegated Act and the Technical Screening Criteria set forth therein predominantly expect insurance activities to adequately reflect climate-related risks and support customers and society in building resilience against the adverse effects of climate change. It consequently reflects the traditional role of the insurance industry as risk manager. Only the \"do no significant harm\" and \"minimum safeguards\" criteria set additional requirements for Taxonomy-alignment beyond the contribution to climate change adaptation.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation does not impose business restrictions or material requirements for insurance activities but introduces disclosure obligations for the insurance Lines of Business (LoBs) in scope. The disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned revenues allows for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios, to channel capital flows towards Sustainable Investments.[2](#page-96-0)\n\n#### <span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>**EU Taxonomy-eligibility**\n\nThe eight LoBs of non-life insurance laid down in the Technical Screening Criteria are in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (\"Taxonomy-eligible\"), as the insurance products sold under these LoBs have the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation. We define all P&C LoBs laid down in Annex 2 section 10.1 of the Climate Delegated as eligible and they have been included in the Taxonomyalignment screening. The template \"Taxonomy KPIs for non-life underwriting\" below also includes our Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible proportions for financial year 2022. Since Taxonomy-alignment has been assessed for the first time by Allianz for financial year 2023, the 2022 figures are not applicable for these lines and marked as such.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy-alignment**\n\nTaxonomy-alignment of an activity goes beyond Taxonomy-eligibility. For non-life insurance business, it implies that the insurance activity substantially contributes to climate change adaptation, does not significantly harm the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards, and complies with the Technical Screening Criteria. We have screened our entire eligible non-life insurance portfolio under the Article 3 Taxonomy Regulation and the Technical Screening Criteria and are reporting accordingly.\n\nIt is in the nature of new regulations that not all details are specified, and a common understanding and application needs to be developed across markets to achieve consistency and comparability. In order to ensure a consistent application across all Allianz entities, we have developed internal guidelines and also taken a conservative approach, where screening criteria left room for interpretation. The following illustrates those aspects that we deem to be the most important and challenging:\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_Draft Commission Notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomyeligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (21 December 2023).\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Further information on Sustainable Investments can be found in section \"02.2\" of the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Leadership in modeling and pricing of climate risks**\n\nState-of-the-art modelling techniques(1.1): Assessing and pricing risks adequately is key for a sustainable and resilient insurance operation. The Allianz approach to state-of-the-art pricing is the Technical Price System as part of our Technical Excellence initiative. In the existing Technical Price Certification (TPC), portfolios are screened on a regular basis across the Allianz Group. A successful TPC requires (but is not limited to), that the technical price is available at policy level. This includes the best estimate of all future, expected costs of the risk (including the expected ultimate loss) as a forward-looking scenario. Both output from hazard mapping and NatCat risk models are included in expected claims costs. Where and to the extent that a portfolio meets our internal TPC requirements, we have concluded that predicted costs of climate related hazards are properly reflected in the Technical Price at best estimate.\n\nProvide incentives for risk reduction (1.3): This criterion is based on the fundamental understanding, that the insurer should protect itself and set incentives for customers to protect themselves or their assets, against the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, it is necessary, however sufficient, if the climate-related exposure is considered in pricing as a price signal of risk (e.g., hazard zones) or in terms and conditions such as deductibles or limits, that serve as a differentiator for respective exposures.\n\n#### **Product design**\n\nRisk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders(2.1): The regulator expects an insurance product to include risk-based rewards for customers to take preventive actions in order to protect themselves or their insured assets against climate change risks. Other than for the previous criterion (\"Provide incentives for risk-reduction), differentiation only related to the location of a risk is not sufficient. We define preventive actions as any specific measures that can be taken by customers if they are suitable to reduce either the frequency or severity of climate change related claims. They must be considered in the product and be offered to all customers. Risk-based rewards must be reflected in the technical price, and there has to be a direct relation between the preventive measure taken by the customer, and the riskbased reward granted. Hence, general deductibles which do not refer to specific preventive measures or no claims discounts are not sufficient.\n\nThe distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures (2.2): The regulator sees adaptation to climate change risks as an overall societal objective to which insurers and their customers should contribute, since risk-prevention is a key lever for reducing the overall economic burden. Thus, the distribution strategy must include measures to ensure that customers (new and existing) are informed about the preventive measures and the relevance of such preventive measure that they could take. Information on the relevance of preventive measures can be shared individually (e.g., through customer specific risk assessment reports in commercial business) or in general, which is appropriate for retail business (e.g., through information in newsletters, regular contract related communication or terms and conditions). It is also appropriate to briefly inform the customers about the topic and direct them to more detailed information, for instance on a company website.\n\n#### **Do no significant harm (\"DNSH\") – Climate change mitigation**\n\nThe DNSH criterion defines which insurance activities related to customers engaged in the fossil fuel value chain must not be classified as sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned). We are taking a mainly conservative approach and define the fossil fuel value chain extensively as upstream (e.g., exploration, extraction), midstream (e.g., transport, storage, pipelines) or downstream (e.g., refinery, trading and sales including gas stations) activities or related assets. Additionally, we consider commercially used fossil fuel power plants to be part of the fossil fuel value chain. Beyond that, the end-use of fossil fuels is not in scope of this criterion (e.g., combustion engine vehicles or oil-fired heating systems). Thus, the DNSH criterion is automatically fulfilled for retail business, as private use is considered as end-use.\n\nIn our portfolio screening approach, we applied the International Standard of Industrial Classification of economic activities (ISIC codes) to identify policies which are not in line with the DNSH criterion as defined above: The different ISIC codes have been classified as either compliant with DNSH, not compliant with DNSH or to be assessed on an individual customer level. We have screened our portfolios against this internal classification system. As our commercial risks are allocated to ISIC codes (or comparable national or internal classifications), we could identify policies and revenues which do not comply with DNSH.\n\nThere are no further environmental objectives next to \"climate change mitigation\" that insurance activities could significantly harm according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, meaning that an <span id=\"page-97-0\"></span>assessment of further DNSH criteria is not applicable. These are still indicated with a \"Y\" in the template \"Taxonomy KPIs for non-life underwriting\" below.\n\n#### **Minimum Safeguards**\n\nTaxonomy-aligned activities needs to be carried out in compliance with Minimum Safeguards with respect to the value chain (i.e., with respect to policyholders in the insurance context). Minimum Safeguards require a due diligence process which is aligned with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. This is ensured by our Sustainability referral process governed by the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM), which applies to insurance transactions following a risk-based approach. For more information on the Sustainability referral process, please refer to the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework, version 5.0 on the **[Allianz](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)  [company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Sustainability-Integration-Framework.pdf)**.\n\n#### **Overall results of EU Taxonomy Screening**\n\nFor the financial year 2023 we are reporting a relatively low share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues. Risk-based rewards for preventative actions and the respective advice to customers turned out to be the most important aspects. We have been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and started developing and implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n### **Allianz's Sustainable Solutions**\n\nChanging customer expectations and demands as well as regulatory evolution are modifying the role of the insurance industry and require a dedicated strategy to manage the impact of sustainability in P&C Business. The Principles for Sustainable Insurance published by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) outline a strategic approach where all activities in the insurance value chain – including interactions with stakeholders – are performed in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental and social issues. The sustainability requirements aim to reduce risks, develop innovative solutions, improve business performance, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability.[1](#page-97-0)\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nSustainable Solutions framework. As a result, our overall approach for assessing and classifying Sustainable Solutions was revised. The former Sustainable Solution definition and its application were replaced by the new Sustainable Solutions framework as of January 1st, 2023. This also enables us to report on Sustainable Solutions based on the new Sustainable Solutions framework for the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Sustainable Solutions framework is based on regulatory requirements (e.g., the EU Taxonomy Regulation) as an integral part. However, it goes beyond and includes additional product elements which contribute to ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation to support our customers in their transition.\n\nWe define a Sustainable (P&C insurance) Solution as an insurance product or service that substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and to one or more further environmental, social, or governance objectives, without doing significant harm to any of the other objectives, which is in line with the principles of Minimum Safeguards and hence supports our customers in transitioning towards an environmentally or socially sustainable way of doing business or living.\n\nTo ensure compliance across the Allianz Group, the Sustainable Solutions framework is codified in internal policies and applies as a harmonized and mandatory framework for all Allianz P&C entities, including a certification process for sustainable products and services. Eligible objectives and suitable product elements have been predefined. They were derived from the EU Taxonomy Regulation – where available[1](#page-98-0) – and the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals, and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- − Climate change mitigation: avoid, reduce or remove GHG emissions.\n- − Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: contribute to good status of water bodies.\n- − Transition to a circular economy: promote durability, re-use and recycling.\n- − Pollution prevention and control: improve quality of air, water, and land.\n\nAgainst this background, we developed an enhanced Allianz – Protection, conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n- − Encourage and expand access to insurance and services for helpers or socially disadvantaged groups.\n- − Foster socially responsible behavior or engagement.\n\nIn 2023, we generated € 3,026 mn revenues from certified Sustainable Solutions in our P&C business. Hence, the Sustainable Solutions framework contributes to our overall purpose: We secure your future.\n\n### **Information on data sources for revenue disclosure**\n\nData collection is conducted in the Solvency II P&C LoB reporting infrastructure. The system is set up in SAP. Information is based on nonconsolidated LoB reporting.\n\n#### **Definition of premiums**\n\nIn line with the requirements that are set forth by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz follows the principle to use figures as premium base that relate to financial reporting and are communicated externally through Allianz financial statements – Total Business Volume (TBV). TBV presents a measure for the overall amount of business generated during a specific reporting period. As TBV by itself does not represent a premium related to the insurance coverage (it also includes fee and commission income), the following adjustment has been performed: As fee and commission income are not directly linked to the provision of insurance coverage, they are eliminated to arrive at the coverage related premium figure.\n\nThis premium figure represents the required gross written premiums level.\n\n#### **Determination of (retro)ceded premium share**\n\nFor natural catastrophe events, the Allianz Group has a centralized program in place that pools exposures from its subsidiaries through internal reinsurance agreements. Allianz SE limits exposures in this portfolio through external reinsurance. Subsidiaries of the Allianz Group generally do not enter into individual external reinsurance agreements for natural catastrophe events. Accordingly, a <span id=\"page-98-1\"></span><span id=\"page-98-0\"></span>breakdown into single Taxonomy-aligned products is not available, as indicated in the template below.\n\nThe guidance on EU Taxonomy Reporting[2](#page-98-1) published by the EU Commission in December 2023 states that insurance undertakings should use those insurance premiums that only pertain to the coverage of climate-related perils for the purpose of computing Taxonomyalignment. Hence, only the portion of the premium from Taxonomyaligned products related to the exposure stemming from climate related perils could be reported as sustainable revenue. We applied this guidance to calculate the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues.\n\nFor our reinsurance contracts issued (third party), we prepared our systems to report the entire premium of any treaty providing coverage for climate-related perils for financial year 2023 reporting, based on the prevailing market practice and interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. With the new requirement to unbundle the premium into solely climate risk related, our systems need further adaptation to systematically allow this premium unbundling in the required quality and could not be done in time for financial year 2023.\n\n### **Ensure implementation into our business**\n\nOur Sustainable Solutions framework and its application have been integrated into the binding Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU), which governs the rules and principles for P&C underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture as described in the Group Risk Policy.\n\nAs of January 2023, all newly developed products and services must be assessed and classified under the Sustainable Solutions framework in the product development process by our operating entities. Results are validated by a dedicated function within our Group Center Global P&C, which has the responsibility to approve or not approve submitted products as a sustainable and in case of a positive approval, issue a respective certification.\n\nIn addition, as of January 2024, products or services may only be labeled, advertised, or in any other way promoted as Sustainable Solutions (or any other term that implies the sustainability of a solution, such as \"green\" or \"social\"), if the product or service is certified under our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_The Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework applies to all P&C insurance LoBs.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Draft Commission Notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-\n\neligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (21 December 2023).\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Allianz's actions and measurements**\n\nThe Sustainable Solutions framework incorporates material ESG objectives into P&C decision-making and portfolio management processes. We aim to shift our product portfolio towards sustainable products by using the Sustainable Solutions framework as guiding considerations in the product development process.\n\nAllianz has always offered comprehensive insurance cover for climate-related perils. Still, closing the insurance protection gap remains a major challenge in many markets. To increase the penetration rate of covers for natural catastrophes, our product strategy is moving towards coverage for natural catastrophes per default (with opt-out elements).\n\nTo manage climate-related risks adequately, we are continuously improving our risk- and pricing-models by integrating the latest data and information on climate change impacts through forward-looking NatCat scenarios and global hazard maps. However, effective adaptation to climate change does not only require adequate pricing of risks, but also individual measures by customers. We have therefore started considering preventative actions taken by the customer in our products and pricing models. Living up to our role as a climate risk manager, we are also integrating advisory services into our customer communication and provide relevant information to customers, for example, on how to build stronger resilience against climate-related events.\n\nIn addition, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for low-carbon technologies – such as battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the related ecosystem – as well as for renewable energy technologies, to support the transition of our customers towards more environment-friendly solutions. For instance, Allianz entities offer BEV insurance products, which meet the specific needs of the new ecosystem such as range anxiety, comprehensive coverage of accessory equipment, and coverage for battery disposal. Within our commercial energy and construction business, we offer insurance to cover the setup, installation, and operation of renewable energy projects such as solar and wind farms, both onshore and offshore.\n\nMaterial ESG objectives are also considered in our claims processes. We have started integrating environmental standards into our claims processes by encouraging or incentivizing our customers, car repair shops, and manufacturers to repair instead of replace or to use refurbished parts, where possible. Moreover, we started increasing our claims payments to our customers to not only rebuild damaged assets such as buildings, but to use more sustainable or energyefficient building materials or elements (build back better), as well as building more resilience against the adverse effects of climate change (build back stronger).\n\n### **Allianz's ambition**\n\nOur ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition to net zero, as well as to support our customers in their transition to environmentfriendly choices.\n\nThe new Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework was launched in January 2023 across all our entities. This includes qualitative targets for the financial year 2023 for to the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating entities to ensure the implementation of Sustainable Solutions. To accelerate the journey in 2024, we have set quantitative growth targets for to the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating entities.\n\nIn our reinsurance lines, we initiated discussions with our clients on their fossil fuel related exposures in order to support their net-zero transition pathways.\n\nAs of 2024, our entities will continue to report internally on a regular basis on the following KPIs:\n\n- − Taxonomy-aligned revenues\n- − Sustainable Solutions-certified revenues.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Template: The underwriting KPI for non-life insurance and reinsurance undertakings**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                 | Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation |                                |                                | DNSH (Do Not Significant Harm) |                               |                  |           |                                |                    |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------|--|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                                                             | Absolute premiums<br>2023                             | Proportion of<br>premiums 2023 | Proportion of<br>premiums 2022 | Climate change<br>mitigation   | Water and marine<br>resources | Circular economy | Pollution | Biodiversity and<br>ecosystems | Minimum safeguards |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                 | € mn                                                  | %                              | %                              | Y/N                            | Y/N                           | Y/N              | Y/N       | Y/N                            | Y/N                |  |\n| A.1.

This means that for Taxonomy reporting as an investor in other undertakings, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Where the Allianz Group fully controls a non-financial investment – including real estate – the scope is not limited in that regard.\n\nThe eligibility and alignment share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments or non-financial assets. For controlled investments and mortgages with property as collateral, Allianz has three main asset classes: real estate held for investment, commercial and retail mortgages, and renewable investments. Allianz's minority interest investments in investees are mostly through publicly listed stocks and bonds. Eligibility for Allianz's controlled assets has been determined for all six environmental objectivesthat are listed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Alignment reporting is produced for the two published environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAs in 2022, all real estate asset classes including mortgages are considered 100% eligible, with the addition in 2023 of joint ventures in real estate. For further information, please refer to section \"Changes to proprietary investment reporting\". Eligibility (and alignment) for Allianz investments in investees is attained via reported data provided by Moody's Analytics.\n\nThe focus of Taxonomy reporting for 2023 is alignment, which is a step beyond eligibility. For an asset to be aligned, three steps are necessary, which is first, the substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives in line with specific Technical Screening Criteria, second, meeting the DNSH criterion (related to the other environmental objectives) and third, meeting the minimum safeguards criteria. Naturally, eligibility is a prerequisite for alignment.\n\nAlignment screening relates to the first two climate change objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Allianz has attained a relatively low alignment quota from screening our own portfolio. The main constraints included lack of data availability for commercial mortgages, and lack of comparative data for real estate held for investment (typically for Energy Performance Certificates determined on demand data that could not be benchmarked to the top 15% of real estate stock).\n\nFor retail mortgage loans especially, Allianz uses a third-party provider (SkenData) that employs an EU Taxonomy model to screen real estate objects at a building level. The criteria used to assess energy performance are equal to the ones used in energy performance certificates. The DNSH criteria considers both the exposure and vulnerability (after considering mitigating action). Overall risk materiality is then determined for each building jointly assessing the said factors. Only when such risk is classified as low or medium, the real estate object can be considered Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses only reported data for listed assets (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent-level data is sourced. If that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data from the ultimate group parent entity. Taxonomy-alignment is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data. The data hierarchy logic is suppressed for investment funds. For further information, please refer to section \"Limitations of reported numbers\".\n\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year 2023 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level. For further information, please refer to section \"Limitations of reported numbers\".\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nAllianz complies with the EU Taxonomy Regulation by reporting the respective Taxonomy KPIs. For investments, these numbers give us a technical view on the current status of our investment portfolio with regards to their Taxonomy-alignment. At this stage, the EU Taxonomy investment criteria is not used for business or investment steering purposes. However, we continue to monitor the evolution of the Taxonomy Regulation to cover further sectors of the economy and become a tool for portfolio steering in the future.\n\n### **Nuclear and Gas Delegated act**\n\nIn addition, as part of the 2023 Taxonomy reporting, Allianz is required to disclose its exposure to the six nuclear and gas activities stipulated in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Annex III). This disclosure seeks to elicit the portion of aligned investments that are a result of the stated activities. For 2023, Allianz's exposure to nuclear and gas activities is considered very small (around 2 % of aligned assets for turnover and CAPEX based on total alignment figures). However, additional disclosure tables have been produced with the limitation that some KPIs were unable to be calculated due to lack of data at the climate objective level.\n\n### **Reporting about third-party asset management**\n\nIn 2023, Allianz took the decision to de-scope third-party asset management from EU Taxonomy investment reporting, in line with current market practice and interpretation of existing regulatory requirements for 2023 reporting.\n\n### **Calculation of KPIs**\n\nThe main alignment KPIs for 2023 include alignment based on turnover and alignment based on CAPEX. For our financial investments, each KPI is determined using only reported data for the investee. If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with a turnover alignment of 10 % and the book value of the investment is 100, Allianz would report a turnover alignment balance of 10. And if Allianz has covered assets of 200, then the final alignment share based on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %. The total alignment based on turnover additionally includes alignment shares from Allianz's own investment real estate held for investment, retail mortgages, and renewable investments. The total alignment KPI based on CAPEX is determined in the same way.\n\nFor 2023, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer investment KPIs detailed in Annex IX/X of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Delegated Act). As mentioned earlier, the main changes regarding the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for 2023 are the introduction of alignment KPIs (by turnover and CAPEX) and the separate tables required for nuclear/gas exposures. The Annex X template has a number of shortcomings, with the main one concerning its specification of the non-eligible KPIs. Eligibility and alignment fractions are determined as a percentage of the turnover or CAPEX denominators. As such, these rows need to be made explicit in the template. In the absence of these rows, the numbers have been provided in the footnotes for completeness.\n\n### **Changes to proprietary investment reporting**\n\nFor Taxonomy reporting in 2023, there were some changes to how Allianz presents its numbers.\n\nThe first change relates to the treatment of cash and cash equivalents. In 2022, Allianz considered these as non-eligible; however, they were included as part of the denominator for KPI calculations. After reassessing the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz has determined that cash and cash equivalents should not be included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. Annex X of the Disclosure Delegated Act defines in-scope assets of insurance and reinsurance undertakings as \"all direct and indirect investments, including investments in collective investment undertakings and participations, loans and mortgages, property, plant and equipment, as well as, where relevant, intangibles\". Cash and cash equivalents are specifically not included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. This view is affirmed b[y EIOPA's technical advice on key](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf)  [performance indicators under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf)  [of February 26, 2021](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/eiopa-21-184-sustainability-non-financial-reporting-advice-art8-taxonomy-regulation.pdf) (EIOPA-21-184).\n\nThe second change relates to the asset classes considered relevant for eligibility. In 2022, Allianz considered investments in real estate funds to be 100 % eligible on the basis that the vast majority of the underlying investments were in real estate. In 2023, Allianz determined that, by the same logic, its joint venture real estate investments should also be 100 % eligible. The impact of this reassessment leads to a small reclassification from non-eligible to eligible for this asset class for 2023.\n\nFinally, in 2023, the transition to a new accounting regime has meant that most of Allianz's real estate investment held for investments are measured at fair value, as opposed to cost less accumulated depreciation. In particular, this has led to higher valuations of the stated asset class compared to the previous year.\n\n### **Limitations of reported numbers**\n\nFor 2023, Allianz is relying on reported information from investees for the year 2022. For that year, financial institutions were not required to report alignment figures; as a result, alignment quotas for the said companies will be low or zero.\n\nFor investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach where possible to report fund eligibility, leveraging data in the Tripartite Template (TPT). However, look-through coverage of companies was limited for 2023 due to limited adoption of the TPT and the inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility. In addition, the aforementioned data hierarchy approach is suppressed for investment funds: if investment level look-through data is not available, eligibility is assumed to be zero. This is because listed asset data for Allianz SE has been collected for the underwriting KPI, which has a high eligibility share of 79 %. This is deemed inappropriately high for investment funds. The conservative approach is designed to mitigate the risk of reporting eligibility figures that may not be representative of the underlying investments. Going forward, Allianz aims to expand the look-through capability for investment funds.\n\nIn addition, a complete screening of our renewables portfolio was not possible for United States based SPVs. The said investments are 100% eligible and likely have a high degree of alignment but have not been considered as such for 2023 reporting due to inadequate data at the time of reporting.\n\nUnder the EU Taxonomy Regulation, our business strategy, product design processes, and engagement with customers and counterparties concept are being integrated into our business activities, but are evolving

operations, supply chain, Life and Health (re)insurance (Life/Health), Property and Casualty (re)insurance (Property-Casualty), as well as our proprietary and third-party investments business. It follows the double materiality principles as per the CSRD/ESRS and the guidance provided by EFRAG in its Draft Implementation Guidance on the materiality assessment from December 2023. The CSRD DMA identifies material impacts, risks, and opportunities that (may) arise in the short-, medium- or long-term, or a mix thereof, following ESRS 1. In terms of topical scope, the CSRD DMA covers both the sustainability matters addressed by the topical ESRS as well as Allianz-specific sustainability matters not (sufficiently) covered therein, based on the previous GRI materiality assessment.\n\nWhen assessing impact materiality, we consider positive and adverse actual and potential impacts caused by, contributed to, or connected with the Allianz Group. Such impacts are assessed based on the criteria scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood. When assessing financial materiality – namely, the materiality of risks and opportunities for the Allianz Group – we take into account the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of the potential financial effects. In this context, we also consider our dependencies on the continuing use of natural, human, and social resources. Financial materiality is assessed in accordance with established Allianz-specific risk assessment processes. For opportunities, the identification is tied to our strategy, as the fact that a strategy to exploit opportunities exists is a precondition for (likely) materialization.\n\nAs to risks, besides the broad range of risk assessments established within the Allianz Group (e.g. Top Risk Assessment), a dedicated in-depth risk assessment covering the CSRD topics alongside the value chain was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 to enhance the CSRD DMA going forward. Until this deep-dive is completed and given that guidance for financial companies and industry practice is still evolving, for 2023 reporting, all CSRD topics are generally considered in scope due to potential risks (e.g. policy or reputational risks). This means that we describe (potential) risks based on a conservative initial approach, thereby reporting on topics broadly, despite the majority of them being (currently) considered to be at most designated \"low materiality\" from a risk perspective. In a similar vein, our impact assessment will be regularly reviewed to reflect, for example, evolving regulation and methodology as well as increasing availability of portfolio-specific data.\n\nThe CSRD DMA is primarily based on desktop research and internal experts' evaluations, with consideration of in-house and external data where available and appropriate, depending on the area of the value chain being assessed:\n\n- − For our own operations, supply chain, Life/Health, and Property-Casualty retail business, we use desktop research as well as inhouse and external data, where available (e.g. GHG emissions), tailored to the Allianz business context and complemented by expert evaluations. In addition, for our Life/Health commercial lines, a country analysis is performed to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and human rights issues.\n- − For our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, the CSRD DMA is data-driven with the aim to identify (potential) impacts, risks, and opportunities related to the portfolio(s) of the Allianz Group, leveraging internal and external available data sources at country, sector, and investment level. Sources include sector proxies for environmental impacts from the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) data base, as well as, for investments, for example principle adverse impacts on sustainability factors (SFDR PAIs) or ESG sub-scores by MSCI. In addition, we conduct a country analysis to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and human rights issues, similar to the analysis mentioned above for our Life/Health commercial lines. The evaluations of these criteria were enhanced by consulting a broad range of relevant business experts, in order to ensure consideration of Allianz portfoliospecific information, especially where there was of a lack of (sufficiently granular) data. Allianz will continue to work on data coverage and quality over the coming years. As to proprietary investments, the first CSRD DMA focuses on General Account investments. The inclusion of unit-linked investments into the CSRD DMA will be revisited during the annual revision process. When assessing impact materiality at portfolio level, we apply absolute thresholds based on gross written premiums for our commercial (re)insurance business and based on assets under management for proprietary investments. This ensures that both multiple smaller impacts and fewer larger impacts are considered in the assessment. Similar to the approach for risks, we tend to include\n\n(potential) adverse impacts in the reporting scope at this stage, following a conservative approach.\n\n− Given that regulatory requirements and market practice are evolving, the assessment of impacts, risks, and opportunities for our third-party asset management has been initiated based on business experts' indicative qualitative assessment as a first step, assessing the extent to which the asset management services offered are associated with (potential) sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities. We will further develop our materiality assessment process for the third-party asset management business for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe CSRD DMA conducted for the financial year 2023 suggests that topics across all topical ESRS are generally material for the Allianz Group, with the level of materiality, the number of material matters considered therein, and the primary drivers of materiality alongside the value chain differing across topics. For example, while the topic \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) is material from an own operations and value chain perspective, the materiality of further environmental topics (ESRS E2-E5) is generally associated with providing financing and insurance to corporate clients. As to social and governancerelated topics, they are particularly relevant from our own operations perspective (esp. ESRS S1, G1), while also playing a role in our value chain (esp. ESRS S2, S3, S4). For our third-party asset management, we have initiated a more detailed assessment, which will be reflected in our reporting for 2024. In addition to the topics \"Climate change\" and \"Own workforce\", \"Business conduct\" remains a key topic for the Allianz Group. Also, our ongoing focus on customer experience alongside the customer journey remains unchanged (ESRS S4), given its materiality and relevance to the Allianz sustainability strategy.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nMaterial (potential) impacts, risks, and opportunities for Allianz are outlined below in more detail:[1](#page-108-0)\n\n- − The topic \"Climate change\" (ESRS E1) is assessed to be material from an own operations and value chain perspective.\n\t- − Adverse impacts in our own operations result from energy usage of our operations and our carbon footprint (mainly driven by this energy usage as well as by business travel), while positive measures are in place via in-place practices of energy savings and renewables usage.\n\t- − For Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to climate change can materialize through insuring and financing carbonintensive activities or sectors, or government exposures with high CO2 emissions (per capita). This is a current reflection, while (potential) adverse impacts for the current portfolios are expected to decrease over time as we work to implement our net-zero transition plan. Regarding positive impacts in our (re)insurance activities and investments, we focus on offering insurance products in line with our Sustainable Solutions framework and on enlarging our Sustainable Investments. For further information, please refer to the section \"02.1.1\" in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)  [website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\t- − Related opportunities are considered material for our Property-Casualty lines and proprietary investments in that we are supporting our clients in their low-carbon transition journey in accordance with our Allianz sustainability strategy and targets.\n\t- − The materiality of climate change risks, especially in our value chain, is mainly driven through physical climate-related risks, with climate-related transition risks – such as policy and litigation risks – increasing with longer time horizons.\n\t- − For further information, please refer to the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n- − The environmental topics beyond the topic of \"Climate change\" which are nature-related – namely \"Pollution\" (ESRS E2), \"Water and marine resources\" (ESRS E3), \"Biodiversity and ecosystems\"\n\n(ESRS E4), and \"Resource use and circular economy\" (ESRS E5) – are assessed to be material for Allianz, primarily from a general value chain perspective.\n\n- − For Property-Casualty commercial lines and investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to these topics can materialize through insuring and financing pollution-, water use-/resource use-intensive and biodiversity-affecting activities, sectors, and governments. For our Property-Casualty retail insurance portfolio, particularly \"Resource use and circular economy\" is material, also giving rise to opportunities associated with our sustainable claims initiative (repair instead of replace).\n- − Given our provision of insurance coverage, the increase of physical hazards – also induced through biodiversity loss – poses a risk for Property-Casualty, which also puts pressure on insurability. This also applies for proprietary investments, given potential nature-related risks for our portfolio. In addition, there is also a potential short-term technology and resource scarcity/price risk for Property-Casualty retail insurance related to \"Resource use and circular economy\".\n- − The materiality of nature-related risks for our own operations and supply chain is related to potential supply chain interruptions and implications for our resource inflows/use, overall dependency on water, as well as potential policy changes in water-stressed areas and regarding resource outflow, especially (IT) waste, also with view to stakeholder expectations.\n- − The topic \"Own workforce\" (ESRS S1) is assessed to be material for Allianz, as our employees are a key success factor for our business, and as we are committed to creating a Great Place To Work®.\n\t- − Positive impacts are created through Allianz practices on employee engagement, training, learning, and personal development, accompanied by strategic workforce planning. We have a strong focus on diversity, equal treatment, and inclusion as well as on talent acquisition and retention. The health and well-being of our employees continues to be an area of focus – our practices include offering flexibility in\n\n<span id=\"page-108-0\"></span>working time, paying above industry-average wages, and fostering freedom of association and dialogue with our employees. Furthermore, securing the confidentiality of employee data is key for us. By implementing these and further practices – including annual risk assessments regarding the protection of human/employee rights in accordance with the German Supply Chain Act – we continue to work to ensure (potential) adverse impacts are prevented and reduced.\n\n- − In terms of financial materiality, risk drivers relate to policy changes as well as skill shortage and retention risk, either associated with demographic change, or by not meeting employee expectations, especially compared to other employers.\n- − We also see opportunities associated with our employees, in that the practices mentioned above allow us to attract and retain talent as a key success factor for our business.\n- − The social topics alongside the value chain (ESRS S2-S4) are assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact and financial perspective.\n\t- − Potential adverse impacts related to \"Workers in the value chain\" (ESRS S2) and \"Affected communities\" (ESRS S3) may materialize for our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, given the large underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios, in which potential cases of insuring and financing activities that adversely affect workers or communities' economic, social, civil, political, and cultural rights may arise. In addition, the topic \"Workers in the value chain\" (ESRS S2) is assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact perspective regarding our suppliers (incl. service providers relevant for our Property-Casualty retail business). In accordance with the German Supply Chain Act, Allianz actively engages with suppliers that are exposed to potential human rights (or certain environmental) risks and expects that all suppliers respect human rights and environmental regulations in their own operations and alongside their supply chain.\n\t- − As to risks, potential cases of adverse impacts regarding value chain workers or affected communities in the value chain can also lead to spill-over effects for Allianz.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_As regards proprietary investments, this disclosure was developed using, among other sources, information from MSCI ESG Research LLC; for disclaimer visit **https://www.msci.com/notice-anddisclaimer**.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Regarding \"Consumers and end-users\" (ESRS S4), we identify actual positive impacts through our Life/Health and Property-Casualty retail, as well as our asset management business, by providing coverage in relation to personal life and health, strengthening protection against poverty, and fostering access to services for clients to reach their financial goals. In addition, securing data privacy and confidentiality of consumer data is key for us. Financial implications may particularly arise in case of policy changes.\n- − The topic \"Business conduct\" (ESRS G1) is assessed to be material for Allianz primarily from an own operations perspective.\n\t- − Given our practices related to corporate culture health, whistleblower protection, supplier management, and prevention of corruption and bribery, we deem our impacts on business conduct to be positive. In addition, we engage with political stakeholders with regards to sustainability-related aspects, and we actively engage in and support regulatory developments. Potential adverse impacts may arise from our proprietary investment portfolio, given exposures to sectors or governments with higher likelihood of business conductrelated issues.\n\t- − As business conduct is also reliant on the proper behavior of individuals, potential risks can never be fully eliminated. As a result, the matters of ethics and responsible business are also considered material from a financial perspective in our own operations and value chain. In addition, cybersecurity is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz in our own operations.\n\t- − Opportunities are associated with enhancing our corporate culture, with the aim of increasing risk awareness of our employees and avoiding misbehavior. In addition, engaging on sustainability-related matters with political stakeholders – such as the net-zero transition or via our contributions to (EU) standard-setting activities – is an opportunity for us to credibly convey our sustainability ambition and strategy.\n\nFor further information on how we addressthese material matters (e.g. prevention, mitigation) and contribute to sustainability, please refer to the previous sections of the Non-Financial Statement as well as the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the **[Allianz company website](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf)**.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Economic environment 2023[1](#page-110-1)\n\nIn economic terms, 2023 provided a few surprises: primarily, the resilience of the U.S. economy. The failure of the predicted recession to materialize was mainly due to U.S. consumers, who remained keen to consume thanks to a robust labor market and excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. As many companies had also secured the previous low interest rates for the long term, the turnaround in interest rates was not yet fully reflected in corporate balance sheets. The bottom line was relatively strong growth of 2.5%; at the same time, inflation fell sharply to 4.1% (annual average).\n\nThe expected upturn in China following the reopening of the economy after the long COVID-19 lockdowns turned out to be shortlived. Structural weaknesses – particularly the challenging situation in the real-estate market – quickly regained the upper hand and dampened sentiment. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy grew by 5.2% in 2023, although this was a rather modest development compared to previous years. Finally, the eurozone recorded weak growth of only 0.5%; at the same time, inflation remained at an annual average of over 5%, although it fell below 3% again at the end of the year. This weak growth was mainly due to developments in Germany, where the economic output fell by 0.3% as a result of the energy price shock. Global economic growth slowed to 2.7%, remaining only slightly below the pre-pandemic average. The fears of recession stoked at the beginning of 2023 did not materialize.\n\nThe interest rate turnaround remained the dominant topic in the financial markets, with the focus increasingly shifting to the question of the end-of-interest-rate-hike cycle. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank conducted their last interest rate hikes for the time being in July and September, respectively. In 2023, the key interest rates in the United States rose by 100 basis points to 5.5%, and in the eurozone by 200 basis points to 4.0% (deposit rate). Despite this fundamentally restrictive monetary policy, the end-of-interest-ratehikes and the expectation of future interest rate cuts led to strong price gains and optimism in the stock markets. U.S. equities (S&P 500) rose by 24% and even German equities (DAX) increased by 20% – despite the shrinking economy. A similar trend was also observed in government bond yields. Contrary to the further rise in key interest rates, yields on German government bonds fell by 53 basis points to 2.0%; U.S. government bonds remained virtually unchanged at 3.9%.\n\n# Business environment 2023 for the insurance industry\n\nInflation remained the defining issue for the insurance industry in 2023. Even though consumer price inflation slowed, claims inflation remained high, not least due to rising wages. This development had a negative impact on underwriting results in property and casualty insurance. Higher repair costs were also a factor – in addition to the climate change-related increase in damage events – that pushed insured losses from natural disasters above the USD 100 bn mark for the fourth year in a row.\n\nThe interest rate level was generally higher, which resulted in rising investment income for insurers from new investments and reinvestments. At the same time, however, this also intensified competition in the life business: simple investment products such as term deposits were once again able to score points with savers, which had a particularly negative impact on the single premium business. However, the feared wave of life policy lapses did not materialize, insurers' business remained stable.\n\nIn 2023, two familiar topics also became increasingly urgent: digitalization and sustainability. The breakthrough of generative artificial intelligence took the digitalization of business processes – especially the customer interface – to a new level. In terms of sustainability, insurability became a particular focus. Increasing natural hazards mean that some risk areas are no longer insurable at affordable prices. Some insurers in the United States have already responded by discontinuing new business in certain lines of business.\n\nIn the property-casualty sector, we observed strong premium growth in some areas in the reporting year, although this was primarily due to rising prices: all insurers had to increase premiums in response <span id=\"page-110-1\"></span>to the persistent claims inflation. Nevertheless, underwriting results remained under pressure in some divisions, like motor. Investment income also increased further due to higher yields.\n\nIn the life sector, premium development was much more subdued. There were also very large differences between the markets due to diverging market and product structures. In general, however, demand for risk products remained strong. Following the end of the pandemic, the topic of old-age provision is once again attracting more attention from consumers. As in property and casualty insurance, the sector has benefited from higher investment returns.\n\n# Business environment 2023 for the asset management industry\n\nThe asset management industry has faced considerable volatility in the capital market over the past 12 months. The key drivers for this were surging inflation and rapidly changing interest rates, compounded by banking turmoil and geopolitical upheaval. Another relevant change is the structural shift towards CO2-neutral business models, bringing with it a requirement for new investment solutions.\n\nStock markets rose, with the MSCI World Index up by 23.8% in 2023. For bonds, active management demonstrated its value for achieving returns against the backdrop of rapidly changing interest rates. Although active investments still account for most of the assets under management, growth in passive and alternative investments continued in 2023. Besides the focus on CO2 emissions and the ongoing growth in ESG-oriented offerings (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance), digitalization with the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies is becoming increasingly important. AI, for example, is creating new opportunities when it comes to analyzing large and unstructured sets of data. Furthermore, AI is finding its way into supporting operational efficiency via innovative forms of automation. Client satisfaction remains a high priority for the asset management value chain as a whole.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_At the date of the publication of this report, not all general market data for the year 2023 used in this chapter was final.

This was mostly driven by our Property-Casualty business segment due to positive price effects and volume effects, from many entities including Allianz Partners, AGCS, and Germany. The Life/Health and the Asset Management business segments also recorded positive internal growth.\n\nOur operating profit increased by 6.7 % in comparison to 2022. This was mainly due to a higher operating investment result from our United States operations in the Life/Health business segment. Our Property-Casualty business segment recorded a solid operating profit driven by a higher operating investment result; this was partly offset by a lower operating fee and other result as well as the insurance service result. Operating profit from our Asset Management business segment declined slightly, mainly as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.\n\nOur operating investment result increased by € 1,025 mn to € 4.8 bn, largely driven by the United States due to an accounting mismatch in the prior year. In addition, in our Property-Casualty business segment we recorded higher interest and similar income mostly due to higher interest rates.\n\nOur non-operating result improved by € 1.0 bn to a loss of € 3.2 bn as the prior year result was negatively impacted by the increase in the Structured Alpha provision. In the current year, we recorded lower non-operating net investment income.\n\nIncome taxes decreased by € 259 mn to € 2.5 bn, and the effective tax rate decreased to 22.0 % (29.1 %), due to a more favorable profit mix, tax benefits from write-up of deferred tax assets on tax losses, higher tax-exempted income, and the absence of nonrecurring items.\n\nThe increase in net income was largely driven by an increase in the provision for litigation expenses for Structured Alpha booked in the first quarter of 2022, higher operating profit, and lower income taxes. Shareholders' core net income was strong at € 9.1 bn.\n\n<span id=\"page-111-2\"></span><span id=\"page-111-1\"></span>Our shareholders' equity[3](#page-111-1) increased by € 4,062 mn to € 58.5 bn, compared to 31 December 2022. This increase was mainly driven by the net income and positive net OCI, partly offset by the dividend payout and share-buy-back program. Over the same period, our Solvency II capitalization ratio increased to 206 %[4](#page-111-2) .\n\nFor a more detailed description of the results generated by each individual business segment (Property-Casualty insurance operations, Life/Health insurance operations, Asset Management, and Corporate and Other), please consult the respective chapters on the following pages.\n\n# Other information\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the responsibilities of the Board of Management.

The € 843 mn rise in our non-operating result was largely due to the higher non-operating investment result, which increased by € 722 mn, mainly due to favorable valuation and lower impairments.

This was due to higher sales in the fixed index annuities business.\n\nItaly: Total business volume increased to € 11,229 mn, a 0.9% increase on an internal basis, mainly due to increases in capital efficient guarantee products and protection and health.\n\nFrance: Total business volume fell slightly to € 7,167 mn, a 1.0% decrease on an internal basis.\n\nAsia-Pacific: Total business volume decreased across the region, except for Thailand and Indonesia, to € 5,872 mn, a 5.7% decrease, on an internal basis. This was driven mainly by Taiwan (€ 380 mn) due to lower unit-linked without guarantees business as a result of contraction in the unit-linked market because of regulatory changes, and China (€ 254 mn), mainly from a decrease in savings and annuities.\n\n# Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)[3](#page-114-2)\n\nOur PVNBP increased by 1.6% to € 67,281 mn. The increase is predominantly driven by the United States due to higher sales in the fixed indexed annuity business and Allianz Reinsurance, through a large reinsurance treaty.

Other operating result represents the sum of Operating result from investment contracts, Operating fee and commission result, and Operating other result.\n\nOperating profit was strong at € 5,191 mn, up 23.1%, mainly due to Allianz Life hedge alignment and normalization. The main drivers of the increase in operating profit are described below:\n\nContractual Service Margin (CSM) release is the main source of profit. The slight decrease was mainly driven by our United States and Reinsurance business caused by a high release in 2022, and Mexico from reclassification of investment business to IFRS 9 following a contract modification. This was partially offset by France from higher release on repriced protection and health products, and Italy from profitable new business and better economics.\n\nRelease of risk adjustment decreased, mainly driven by an assumption update.\n\nVariance from claims and expenses improved, mainly from France and Asia-Pacific, with improved claims experience in protection and health.\n\nLosses and reversals of losses on onerous contracts improved primarily driven by prior year negative impacts with unprofitable unitlinked and protection business in France, losses in Russia following the war in Ukraine, as well as Taiwan savings, driven by favorable interest rates.\n\n#### Non-attributable expenses were stable.\n\nOperating investment result increased significantly from an extraordinary low result in the prior year. In the United States, we recorded negative hedge impacts on variable annuities in 2022 that turned positive as the hedging strategy of our United States business has been aligned from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17 accounting. This was partially offset by an adverse impact from discounting in protection and health in France in line with interest rates evolution.\n\nOther operating result increased slightly, mainly due to a reclassification of the investment business to IFRS 9 in Mexico following a contract modification and a one-off gain realized on headquarter sale in Luxembourg. This was partly offset mainly by a lower result of Investment Contracts as a result of reduced Assets under Management in Italy.\n\n# Contractual service margin (CSM) development\n\nThe CSM increased by 0.7%, compared to 31 December 2022, from € 52,227 mn to € 52,601 mn. The drivers of the € 375 mn increase were as follows:\n\nNew business contribution was strong at € 4,515 mn, mostly driven by the United States with € 1,320 mn, Germany Life with € 880 mn, Asia-Pacific with € 649 mn, Italy with € 496 mn, and France with € 416 mn.\n\nExpected in-force return of € 3,022 mn is in line with an implied risk-free rate of 4.4% plus an overreturn yield of 1.4 %.\n\nEconomic variances of € 500 mn were caused by favorable impact from market movements (€ 0.9 bn), driven by higher equity markets and lower interest rates, offsetting adverse impact from weaker real estate. In addition, there was a negative foreign currency translation impact of € 0.4 bn.\n\nNon-economic variances reduced CSM by € 2,696 mn, mainly driven by model and assumption changes and experience variances (€ 1.2 bn), reclassification of investment business in Mexico from IFRS 17 to IFRS 9 (impact was negative € 0.7 bn), and a one-off cost correction in Germany (impact was negative € 0.8 bn).

On the one hand, this reflects the expectation that inflation is largely under control, as annual average inflation will probably be within striking distance of inflation targets in both the United States (2.3 %) and the eurozone (2.5 %). On the other hand, it is a reaction to the continued weakness in demand, which is fed by several sources: the delayed effect of interest rate hikes on investment, declining fiscal policy support, and depleted savings reserves. Overall, we therefore expect economic growth to decline in 2024, falling by 0.3 percentage points to 2.4 % worldwide; for the United States, we expect it to decline to 1.4 % (-1.0 percentage points). Only the eurozone is likely to reach around the previous year's level with a rate of 0.8 %, as a return to positive growth is assumed for Germany. China will also face headwinds, not least due to its structural problems: we expect rather modest growth of 4.6 %.\n\nOngoing uncertainty about the timing and extent of the next interest rate moves means volatility in the financial markets will remain high in 2024. As the expected cuts in interest rates have already been anticipated in many market prices, disappointment and corresponding market reactions cannot be ruled out. Overall, equities and bonds are likely to move more or less sideways.\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is subject to a special caveat since it is a super election year. Citizens will go to the polls in countries that account for 60 % of global economic output – from India to the United States – with election results significantly impacting the economic and geopolitical constellation. First and foremost, this applies to the U.S. elections in November. The associated global political uncertainty is fostering a wait-and-see-attitude among companies and households. There is also the threat of rising political and social tensions as a result of increasing polarization in a weak economic environment.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nInflation will remain a dominant topic for the insurance industry in 2024, as claims inflation is unlikely to fall as quickly as consumer price inflation, mainly due to rising wages. However, continued premium increases mean that pressure on underwriting results should ease. On the other hand, the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment is hampering premium growth.\n\nIn view of the increasing geopolitical upheavals, climate-related natural hazards, and technological risks worldwide, the need for risk protection and prevention remains high. Thanks to its financial strength, the insurance industry can meet these needs with innovative solutions, so its role as a partner for strengthening social resilience will continue to grow in importance.\n\nDespite ongoing high volatility, the investment environment should remain relatively friendly in 2024. The higher interest rate level offers good opportunities for long-term investors, and insurers' investment income is likely to continue to rise.\n\nPremium growth in the property-casualty insurance sector will continue at a slower pace; however, as in the previous year it is likely to be driven primarily by rising prices. At the same time, claims development remains challenging, with structural factors such as increasing climate-related natural catastrophes also playing a role. Investment income is expected to increase. As higher wages are putting pressure on operating costs, increasing productivity through fully digitalized processes is essential.\n\nIn the life insurance sector, providers are increasingly reflecting the higher interest rate level in their products, which should benefit demand for savings and pension products. This is possible because awareness of the need for protection in old age not only remains high but should also continue to rise in the future. The same applies to demand in the risk business. Furthermore, higher investment income will strengthen profitability.\n\n## <span id=\"page-120-0\"></span>Asset management industry outlook\n\nIn 2024, the asset management industry will probably face a different economic landscape to 2023, and will also be impacted by megatrends, including disruptive technologies and sustainability.\n\nThis challenging environment is an opportunity for active asset management to demonstrate its value potential by focusing on diversification and risk management, which help to deliver outperformance.\n\nWith inflation falling and rate cuts expected in the United States and the eurozone, there will be many opportunities in bond markets. Fixed income will therefore be an important asset class for investors in 2024. Investment grade, for example, is likely to benefit from strong yield levels, manageable supply and still decent fundamentals. Demand for alternatives – especially private market assets – is also expected to remain high. This trend is supported by investors looking for both diversification and protection against inflation. Infrastructure – including renewable energy – is expected to grow further, driven by the effort to limit CO2 emissions. In this context, ESG-oriented investments are becoming more complex and competitive, as many investors seek ways to make a real-world impact by focusing on environmental and inclusive-growth themes.\n\nTechnology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), will emerge as a core part of the long-term opportunity set. AI will be increasingly implemented and will help raise global productivity by both automating laborious tasks and analyzing large data sets .\n\nMargin pressure is very likely to persist, driven by passive products as well as fierce competition. Despite this multifaceted situation, the asset management industry meets all the prerequisites to remain attractive and return to a long-term growth path.\n\n1\\_The information presented in the sections \"Economic outlook\", \"Insurance industry outlook\", and \"Asset management industry outlook\" is based on our own estimates.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Overview: outlook and assumptions for the Allianz Group in 2024\n\n| Outlook 2024      |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allianz Group     | Operating profit of € 14.8 bn, plus or minus € 1 bn.                                                                                                                                             |\n|                   | Protect shareholder value while continuing to provide<br>attractive returns and dividends.                                                                                                       |\n|                   | Selective profitable growth.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Property-Casualty | Total business volume growth of 5 % to 7 %.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                   | Operating profit of € 7.3 bn, plus or minus 10 %.                                                                                                                                                |\n|                   | Combined ratio to be in a range of approximately 93 % to<br>94 %.                                                                                                                                |\n|                   | Operating investment income (net) further benefiting from<br>high interest-rate environment while unwinding of<br>discounted loss reserves weighing negatively.                                  |\n| Life/Health       | Continue to focus on profitable growth; keep developing<br>capital-efficient products; expand to new markets.

For 2024, we envisage 3% growth overall, resulting from growth in Property-Casualty and Asset Management, combined with relatively stable revenues in Life/Health, owing to our selective focus on profitable growth.\n\nOur operating profit was € 14.7 bn in 2023. For 2024, we envisage strong performance in all business segments and an overall operating profit of € 14.8 bn, plus or minus € 1.0 bn.\n\nOur core net income attributable to shareholders was € 9.1 bn in 2023. Consistent with our disclosure practice in the past and given the sensitivity of our non-operating results to capital market developments, we have chosen not to provide a precise outlook for net income. However, since our outlook presumes no major disruptions in our capital markets, we anticipate a positive development for both net income and core net income in 2024.\n\nIn this business segment, we expect total business volume to increase by 5% to 7% in 2024 (total business volume growth in 2023: 8.4%) due to organic growth, which is supported by favorable price and volume effects across our subsidiaries.\n\nWe believe that the rise in prices we saw in a number of markets in 2023 will continue in 2024. That said, we will continue to focus on achieving strong insurance service results by adhering to our strict underwriting discipline, as in previous years.\n\nOur combined ratio was 93.8% in 2023, which is above target. In 2024, we envisage a combined ratio in the range of approximately 93% to 94%. The underlying assumption is that the aggregate effect of improvements in pricing, claims management, and productivity will compensate for inflation in attritional claims. The impact of discounting loss reserves on our combined ratio depends on the <span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>development of interest rate levels throughout 2024. As for impacts from natural catastrophes, despite the highly volatile nature of such catastrophes in recent years, we expect those claims to be at approximately 3%.\n\nThe investment income is expected to further benefit from the high interest-rate environment, despite a likely reduction of interest rates in the second half of 2024. Going forward, we will continue to actively adapt our investment strategy to changing market conditions. It should be noted that, with the introduction of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard, the unwinding of discounted loss reserves will weigh on our investment income, dependent on interest rate levels of prior years.\n\nOverall, we expect our 2024 operating profit to be € 7.3 bn, plus or minus 10% (2023: € 6.9 bn).\n\nCore RoE is one of the KPIs used in the financial steering of Life/Health. In 2024, we expect this KPI to be between 14% and 17% (2023: 16.3%). We expect that CSM normalized growth will be between 4% and 5%, which will support long-term stability and growth of operating profit.\n\nAt € 5.2 bn, the operating profit of our Life/Health business segment was within the target range in 2023. For 2024, we expect an operating profit of around € 5.2 bn, plus or minus 10%.\n\nFor 2024, we envisage overall moderate third-party net inflows and market returns at both PIMCO and AllianzGI, after a year of capital market volatility and high inflation. Margins should remain relatively stable, and we expect a normal level of performance fees, resulting in modest operating revenue growth. We further assume an average U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.091. All things considered and reflecting our current asset base, we expect our 2024 operating profit to be € 3.1 bn, plus or minus 10% (2023: € 3.1 bn).\n\nOur cost-income ratio should be approximately 61% in 2024 (2023: 61.3%) as we continue to invest in business growth. Over the medium term, we expect to grow further; this also depends on the market development.\n\nIn this business segment, we recorded an operating loss of € 0.5 bn in 2023. For 2024, we envisage an operating loss of € 0.8 bn plus or minus 10%.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Non-financial KPIs\n\nAs outlined in the \"Our Steering\" section in our [Business Operations](#page-52-0) chapter, we have also set ourselves non-financial targets. For further information on the past and expected development of these nonfinancial KPIs, please refer to th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n# Financing, liquidity development, and capitalization\n\nThe Allianz Group enjoys a very robust liquidity position and excellent financial strength, as well as a healthy business mix and global diversification. This allows us to maintain high performance, despite challenges and market volatility faced by our insurance segment. The Allianz Group's Solvency II capitalization is well above regulatory requirements.\n\nAs a result, we have full access to financial markets and are in a position to raise financing at lower cost. We are determined to maintain our financial flexibility, which is supported by both the prudent steering of our liquidity resources, and our well-balanced debt maturity profile.\n\nWe are managing our portfolios with great diligence, in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to back its solvency capital and liquidity needs. In addition, we will continue to monitor the sensitivity of our Solvency II capitalization ratio with regard to changes in interest rates and spreads, by continuing to ensure prudent asset/liability management and life product design.\n\n# Expected dividend development<sup>1</sup>\n\nAllianz management is committed to shareholder participation in the economic development of the Allianz Group in the form of dividend payments and share buy-back programs. Through prudent capital management, the Allianz Group aims to maintain a healthy balance between achieving attractive yields and investing in profitable growth, while assuring an adequate capitalization. Due to our strong business development and an attractive dividend policy, the dividend has increased by an average of 10% over the past 10 years (2013- 2022). In the interest of an attractive dividend to our shareholders, we will increase the regular payout ratio from 50% to 60% of the Group´s net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted for extraordinary and volatile items. For 2023, the Allianz SE Board of Management and the Supervisory Board propose a dividend of € 13.80 per share.\n\nIn addition, as part of our policy to return capital to shareholders on a flexible basis, Allianz SE executed nine share buy-back programs with an aggregate volume of € 12.5 bn in the period from 2017 to 2023. An additional € 1.0 bn will be executed in 2024.\n\nAll of the above is subject to our sustainable Solvency II capitalization ratio being above 150% – which is considerably below our year-end 2023 level of 206%[2](#page-122-0) .\n\n# Management's overall assessment of the Allianz Group's current economic situation\n\nAt the date of issuance of this Annual Report and based on current information regarding natural catastrophes and capital market trends – in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities – the Board of Management has no indication of the Allianz Group facing any major adverse developments.\n\n# Cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements, such as prospects or expectations, that are based on management's current views and assumptions and subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance figures, or events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\n\nDeviations may arise due to changes in factors including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the general economic and competitive situation in Allianz's core business and core markets, (ii) the performance of financial markets (in particular market volatility, liquidity, and credit events), (iii) adverse publicity, regulatory actions or litigation with respect to the Allianz Group, other well-known companies, and the financial services industry generally, (iv) the <span id=\"page-122-0\"></span>frequency and severity of insured loss events, including those resulting from natural catastrophes, and the development of loss expenses, (v) mortality and morbidity levels and trends, (vi) persistency levels, (vii) the extent of credit defaults, (viii) interest rate levels, (ix) currency exchange rates, most notably the EUR/USD exchange rate, (x) changes in laws and regulations, including tax regulations, (xi) the impact of acquisitions, including and related to integration issues and reorganization measures, and (xii) the general competitive conditions that, in each individual case, apply at a local, regional, national, and/or global level. Many of these changes can be exacerbated by terrorist activities.\n\n# No duty to update\n\nAllianz assumes no obligation to update any information or forwardlooking statement contained herein, save for any information we are required to disclose by law.\n\nthe Management and Supervisory Boards, each of which may elect to deviate, if and as appropriate, under the then prevailing circumstances, as well as to the approval of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This represents management's current state of planning and may be revised in the future.

The retained earnings were mainly decreased by the share buy-back program with an amount of € 2.2 bn and the dividend payout in May 2023 (€ 4.5 bn). This was compensated by the net income attributable to shareholders of € 8.5 bn for the year ended 31 December 2023. The increase in other unrealized gains and losses (net) of € 23.3 bn was almost offset by the decrease of unrealized gains and loss from insurance contracts (net) with an amount of € 20.6 bn. The development of unrealized gains and losses is driven by the increase of interest rate level over the course of the year 2023.\n\n# Total assets and total liabilities\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, total assets amounted to € 983.2 bn and total liabilities were € 919.6 bn.

About 94 % of the debt portfolio was invested in investment-grade bonds and loans.[1](#page-124-0) Our government bonds portfolio contained bonds from France, Germany, Italy, and the United States, representing 13.0%, 12.4 %, 9.7% and 8.8 % of our portfolio shares. Our corporate bonds portfolio contained bonds from the United States, the eurozone, and Europe excl. the eurozone. They represented 41.7 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % of our portfolio shares.\n\nOur exposure to equities decreased, mainly due to decreasing volume.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Allianz Group may enter into arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Since the Allianz Group does not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements as a significant source of revenue or financing, our off-balance sheet exposure to loss is immaterial relative to our financial position.\n\nThe Allianz Group enters into various commitments including loan commitments, purchase obligations, and other commitments. For more details, please refer to [note 8.13](#page-237-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Allianz Group has also entered into contractual relationships with various types of structured entities. They have been designed in such a way that their relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements rather than voting or similar rights. Typically, structured entities have been set up in connection with asset-backed financing and certain investment fund products. For more details on our involvement with structured entities, please refer t[o note 8.11](#page-235-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nPlease refer to the [Risk and Opportunity Report](#page-129-0) for a description of the main concentrations of risk and other relevant risk positions.\n\n<span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>For details on the regulatory capitalization of the Allianz Group, please refer to ou[r Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-125-0\"></span>LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RESOURCES\n\n# Organization\n\nThe Allianz Group's liquidity management is based on policies and guidelines approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management. Allianz SE and each of the operating entities are responsible for managing their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz SE provides central cash pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is managed by Allianz SE for the entire Group. This structure allows the efficient use of liquidity and capital resources, and enables Allianz SE to achieve the desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its operating entities.\n\n# Liquidity management of our operating entities\n\nThe major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are primary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the maturity or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay claims arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and related expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations, acquisition costs, and operating costs.\n\nWe receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the interim to create investment income.\n\nOur insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims. Generally, our investments in fixed-income securities are sequenced to mature when funds are expected to be needed.\n\nThe overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on capital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to realize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance claims and policyholder benefits. Other factors affecting the liquidity of our Property-Casualty insurance operations include the timing, frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy\n\nrenewal rates. In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the assumptions underlying our life insurance reserves. Market returns, crediting rates, and the behavior of our life insurance clients – for example, regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals – can also have a significant impact.\n\nWithin our Asset Management operations, the most important sources of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities. These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.\n\n# Liquidity management and funding of Allianz SE\n\nThe main responsibility for managing the funding needs of the Allianz Group, maximizing access to liquidity sources and optimizing the trade off between borrowing costs, balancing the maturity profile, and the choice between senior and subordinated funding instruments, lies with Allianz SE. As such, the following sections include comments on the liquidity and funding resources of Allianz SE. Restrictions on the transferability of capital within the Group mainly result from the capital maintenance rules under applicable corporate laws as well as from the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulated Group companies.\n\nAllianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our operating entities. The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are dividends received from its subsidiaries and external funding raised in the capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily available assets – specifically cash, money market securities, and highly liquid fixed-income securities. Our funds are primarily used for interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends or share buy-backs to our shareholders.\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE in the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are described below. In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered by issuing senior bonds, subordinated bonds or ordinary no-par value shares.\n\n### **Share capital**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the issued share capital as registered at the Commercial Register was € 1,169,920,000. This was divided into 391,718,983 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group held 260,394 (2022: 1,724,834) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital according to authorizations provided by the Annual General Meeting. The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2023:\n\n### **Capital authorizations ofAllianz SE**\n\n| Capital authorization          | Nominal amount | Expiry date of<br>the authorization |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital<br>2022/I1  | € 467,968,000  | 3 May 2027                          |\n| Authorized Capital<br>2022/II2 | € 15,000,000   | 3 May 2027                          |\n| Conditional Capital<br>20223   | € 116,992,000  | 3 May 2027                          |\n\n1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind.\n\n2\\_For issuance of shares to employees (without shareholders' subscription rights).\n\n3\\_To cover conversion or option rights of holders of bonds.\n\nFor further information on our share capital and regarding authorizations to issue and repurchase shares, please refer to the chapter [Takeover-Related Statements and Explanations](#page-23-0) (part of the Group Management Report).\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Long-term debt funding**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE had senior and subordinated bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus on long-term financing.

This was mainly driven by higher net changes from our insurance and investment contract liabilities with partially offsetting effects from financial assets for unit-linked contracts. In addition, last year we recorded the settlement of the majority of the provision related to the Structured Alpha matter.\n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased by € 3.0 bn to € 12.0 bn in 2023. This was mainly due to net cash inflows from derivative assets and liabilities after material net cash outflows in 2022, in particular in our Life/Health business operations. Lower net cash inflows from investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly in our Life/Health business operations in Germany, France, and the United States, as well as higher net cash outflows from investments measured at fair value through profit or loss, partly compensated this effect.\n\nNet cash outflow used in financing activities increased by € 1.4 bn and amounted to € 5.7 bn in 2023. This development was largely driven by lower net cash inflows from liabilities to banks and customers and other financial liabilities as well as higher net cash outflows from the Allianz SE share buy-back program. Lower net cash outflows from our refinancing activities and higher net cash inflows from transactions between equityholders partially offset these effects.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by € 6.3 bn, mainly stemming from our Life/Health business operations in Germany and the United States.\n\nFor further information on the above, please refer to our [Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.](#page-155-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group maintained its A-1+/Prime-1 ratings for short-term issuances. We can therefore continue funding our liquidity under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at an average rate below Euribor, and under the U.S. Dollar Commercial Paper Program at an average rate slightly above SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate).\n\nFurther potential sources of short-term funding that allow the Allianz Group to fine-tune its capital structure include letter of credit facilities and bank credit lines.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>RECONCILIATIONS\n\nThe analysis in the previous chapters is based on our consolidated Internal growth financial statements and should be read in conjunction with them. In addition to our figures stated in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Allianz Group uses total business volume, operating profit, shareholders' core net income, and internal growth to enhance the understanding of our results. These additional measures should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, our figures determined according to IFRS.\n\nFor further information, please refer t[o note](#page-172-0) 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Total business volume\n\nTotal business volume comprises gross premiums written as well as fee and commission income in Property-Casualty, statutory gross premiums in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management.\n\n#### **Composition of total business volume**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Property-Casualty                   |         |         |\n| Total business volume               | 76,531  | 70,613  |\n| consisting of:                      |         |         |\n| Gross premiums written              | 73,998  | 68,222  |\n| Fee and commission income           | 2,534   | 2,391   |\n| Life/Health                         |         |         |\n| Statutory gross premiums            | 77,878  | 75,258  |\n| Asset Management                    |         |         |\n| Operating revenues                  | 8,086   | 8,234   |\n| consisting of:                      |         |         |\n| Net fee and commission income       | 7,960   | 8,211   |\n| Net investment result               | 95      | 7       |\n| Other income and expenses           | 31      | 16      |\n| Consolidation                       | (795)   | (781)   |\n| Allianz Group total business volume | 161.700 | 153.324 |\n\nWe believe that an understanding of our total business volume performance is enhanced when the effects of foreign currency translation as well as acquisitions, disposals, and transfers (or \"changes in scope of consolidation\") are analyzed separately.

While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies' capital requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of the Group, Allianz SE and its other related undertakings, and apply regular stress tests (including standardized, historical, and reverse stress test scenarios as well as monthly stress and scenario analyses focusing on current and possible future developments). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency strength. For example, the risk capital reflecting the risk profile and the cost of capital is an important aspect that is considered in business decisions. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite and in line with the risk strategy. The implemented sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continuous alignment of the risk and business strategy, and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition,our liquidity risk management framework ensures that all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market and business conditions (expected as well as stressed).\n\n# Risk governance system and internal control system\n\nAs a provider of financial services, we consider risk management, including an internal control system (ICS), to be a core competency and an integralpart of our business. Our risk management framework covers all operations and subsidiaries within the Group in proportion to the inherent risks of their activities, ensuring that risks across the Group are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management and internal control system framework are:\n\n- − Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- − Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk capital framework to protect our capital base and support effective capital management.\n- − Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allocating capital to business segments, products, and strategies.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- − Risk identification, assessment and underwriting: A robust system of risk identification, assessment and underwriting forms the foundation for appropriate risk management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation methods, individual transaction and new product approvals, emerging/operational/top risk assessments, liquidity risk and scenario analyses, amongst others.\n- − Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite in line with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards are appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies work in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n- − Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework provides management with the transparency needed to assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n- − Communication and transparency: Transparent risk disclosure provides the basis for communicating our strategy and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens the risk awareness and risk culture.\n\nIn order to support these pillars, especially risk identification, assessment and monitoring, the Allianz Group has established an ICS, which consists of both specific risk controls and further control elements. Its objectives are to:\n\n- − Safeguard the Group's existence and business continuity.\n- − Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n- − Create a strong internal control environment, ensuring that all personnel are aware of the importance of internal controls and their role within the internal control system.\n- − Provide the management bodies with the relevant information for their decision-making processes.\n\nNotwithstanding the oversight exercised by the Supervisory Board of the Allianz SE, controls are performed within the Allianz Group in terms of control areas, activities, and reporting, taking into account independence requirements, where applicable. The controls are embedded into the operational and organizational set-up throughout the Allianz Group and are subject to periodic reviews. Where appropriate, internationally recognized control frameworks such as the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) or the IT-related Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are used.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nInternal controls, therefore, describe the set of activities undertaken by and within the Allianz Group to achieve defined control objectives, applied across all business segments and lines of business. These controls help to continuously review the effectiveness of the relevant processes and procedures (including operations and reporting), their coherence and proportionality within the Group, and to identify potential actions for the timely rectification of deficiencies. The ICS of the Allianz Group encompasses the entirety of activities undertaken to perform controls in different areas.\n\nThe ICS comprises various control concepts. Besides general elements related to all control activities, and in addition to the Risk Management Framework, specific controls are utilized, in particular, but not exclusively, around entity level controls, financial reporting, IT, risk capital calculation, underwriting (including products and distribution), investments, data privacy, customer protection, and protection/resilience. These are supplemented by management reports.\n\n### **Integrated Risk and Control System for financial and non-financial reporting**\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to §289(4) and §315(4) of the German Commercial Code (\"Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB\"). For general information about our Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) and the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), please refer to the section \"Operational risk\".\n\n#### **Accounting and consolidation processes**\n\nThe accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a central consolidation and reporting IT solution and local general ledger solutions. The latter are largely harmonized throughout the Group, using standardized processes, master data, posting logics, and interfaces for data delivery to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are managed according to strict authorization and hierarchylinked procedures.\n\nAccounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure of all items in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes related to the annual and interim financial statements are defined primarily in our Group accounting manual.\n\n#### **Control system for financial and non-financial reporting**\n\nSpecific internal controls for financial reporting, which follow the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) approach and the general Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), are embedded in the accounting and consolidation processes to safeguard the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information provided in our financial statements.\n\nThe dedicated financial reporting control system approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- − A centrally developed risk catalog is linked to individual accounts. This risk catalog is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as the operating entities' scope of financial reporting risks. In the course of the scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria, such as the expected increase in business volume or the complexity of transactions.\n- − Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, our local entities identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- − Preventive and detective key controls addressing financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial misstatements. When a potential risk is detected or materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on information technology systems, we have also implemented IT controls.\n- − Operating entity level controls to address non-financial reporting risks have been introduced and will be expanded going forward.\n- − Group Audit and local internal audit functions ensure that these controls are subject to regular control testing, in order to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness. Internal Audit does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach that assesses the key controls of the company's internal procedures and processes, including local and group-internal controls over financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.\n\n#### **Governance**\n\nGroup Accounting & Reporting and other Group center functions, the Group Disclosure Committee, and our operating entities support the Allianz SE Board of Management to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Group Accounting & Reporting also helps to ensure that non-financial reporting requirements are fulfilled and that data quality requirements are adhered to.\n\nThe Group Disclosure Committee ensures that the Board members are made aware of all material information that could affect our disclosures and assesses the completeness and accuracy of the information provided in the quarterly statements, half-year and annual financial reports (including the Non-Financial Statement) as well as in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report and the Regular Supervisory Report. In 2023, the Group Disclosure Committee met on a quarterly basis before the quarterly statements and financial reports were issued. In addition, the Group Disclosure Committee reviewed and approved the Solvency II reports prior to issuance.\n\nSubsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individually responsible for adhering to the Group's internal governance and control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are similar to the Group-level committee. The entities' CEOs and CFOs provide periodic signoffs to the management of Allianz SE, certifying the effectiveness of their local systems of internal control as well as the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data and nonfinancial information reported to the Holding.\n\n### **Compliance management system**\n\nThe risk management system encompasses both a set of principles for specifically addressing the operational and reputational risks stemming from non-compliance with laws, regulations, and other external requirements that represent a significant compliance risk (hereafter referred to as \"compliance risks\"), as well as their reflection in internal corporate rules.\n\nFor the management of compliance risks, Allianz maintains a Compliance Management System (CMS). At the center of the CMS, Allianz has established compliance functions at the levels of the Allianz Group and the local operating entities as part of the Second Line of Defense. For details of the CMS, or more specifically of anticorruption and bribery matters, please refer to the [Non-Financial](#page-55-0)  [Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Management assessment[1](#page-131-0)**\n\nThe management feels comfortable with the Group's overall risk profile. It has no indication that, as of 31 December 2023, our risk management system or internal control system is inappropriate or ineffective, and is therefore confident that they meet both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and day-to-day business needs.\n\nThis assessment is based on several factors:\n\n- − We run an established system to monitor the effectiveness of the internal control system and to report and promptly address deficiencies, such as control failures, operational loss events, financial limit breaches, or system of governance issues. On a quarterly basis, the Group's Internal Control System Report is jointly prepared by the Group's key control functions, and shared with the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and the members of the Board of Management of the Allianz SE. The report aggregates and rates the severity of known weaknesses in the internal control system, while also tracking their timely and satisfactory resolution.\n- − Our Group risk management framework, including the Group's internal control system, are regularly the subject of audit activities performed by our Group's Internal Audit function.\n- − In addition, external auditors are independently and regularly reviewing Allianz Group's risk governance as well as performing quality reviews of risk processes, including the ICS.\n- − An assessment of the effectiveness of the Allianz operating entities' Risk Management functions, as well as of the implementation maturity of the risk management framework and corresponding risk management processes, is performed following the Risk Assessment, Diagnostics, Analysis and Reporting (RADAR) process.\n- − Allianz has dedicated guidelines and policies that clearly define the general principles, the roles and responsibilities, as well as the processes, for both the risk management framework and the internal control system.\n\nAllianz will be required to comply with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) regulations by the end of the financial year 2024. While the new CSRD reporting requirements are being established, our internal control system is undergoing continual enhancements. A dedicated project helps to ensure diligent preparation for CSRD implementation, including the early identification of where improvements are necessary.\n\n### **Structured Alpha funds of AllianzGI U.S.**\n\nAs highlighted in our prior year report, the settlement of Structured Alpha related litigations was finalized both with investors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the uncertainties linked to this litigation have now been completely curtailed, the Allianz Group continues to exercise diligence in assuring that the Asset Management segment's internal control systems, as well as those of the Group, benefit from the key learnings stemming from this event. We continue to enhance risk management, compliance, and other assurance measures. This covers not only our response to Structured Alpha derived root causes, but we have ensured that periodic reviews of our internal controls systems' frameworks and underlying procedures also remain sensitive to a constant and rapidly evolving risk landscape.\n\nGoing beyond Management's evaluation of control measures and tactics, various audits undertaken by both internal and external auditors have been completed to confirm the robustness and persistence of the internal control system. The Asset Management segment in particular has also undergone various regulatory reviews and audits throughout various regions, and no significant issues or topics have been raised by the regulators.\n\nAs part of our settlement procedures, Allianz has also completed control environment assessment steps related to our U.S. investment advisory services. These assessments were finalized and conclusions reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in 2023. As this was one of the final key milestones, the Allianz Group has fulfilled its legal obligations to the U.S. authorities.\n\nIn addition to efforts triggered by the AllianzGI Structured Alpha matter, a strengthening of trainings for safeguarding functions and Allianz Global Executives further improved the Allianz Group's risk management framework in the last year.\n\n### **Our business aspirations**\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives for the Allianz Group's medium-term strategy, building on the success of the efforts to simplify the company, with the motto \"Simplicity at Scale\":\n\n- <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>− Growth: We consistently seek to capture growth opportunities for our business, and to create growth opportunities for our employees. This is how we ensure our leading market position. Due to our full breadth of products and services, we offer comprehensive solutions that meet our customers' needs and make us a trusted partner.\n- − Margin Expansion: We need to be profitable and efficient. To do so we are continuously improving our productivity, including in our distribution channels, while seeking to grow in high margin business segments. Additionally, we will continue our transformation so that our processes are simpler, digital, and scalable.\n- − Capital Efficiency: We consistently seek ways to use our capital in the most effective way and take action when, among others, it falls below our RoE threshold.\n\nThese objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the 2022 to 2024 period. With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds<sup>2</sup>) of more than 13 %, while aiming to grow our earnings per share from € 21 (baseline full year 2021, as communicated in the Allianz Capital Markets Day 2021) to approximately € 25[3](#page-131-0) by 2024 (reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 5 % to 7 %).\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set ourselves non-financial targets that reflect strong underlying organizational health. For customer loyalty, our ambition is for more than 50 % of the business segments of our entities to be or become rated by their customers as a \"loyalty leader\" in terms of the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS) by 2024. In terms of employee engagement, our ambition is to score above 75 % on the Inclusive Meritocracy Index. At the same time, we have also set the target to become a clear leader in sustainability and diversity.\n\n### **Our business strategy**\n\nTo implement these strategic objectives, to realize our growth ambition, and to accelerate our value creation, we have defined five additional strategic areas of focus:\n\n− Transforming the Life/Health and Asset Management franchise: Fully address protection and savings needs and accelerate transformation to a capital-efficient model, leveraging our \n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nstrengths in Asset Management to deliver investor-defined risk/return requirements, through various investment disciplines.\n\n- − Expanding our Property & Casualty leadership position: Beat the best players in each market, building on productivity gains and scale, in retail motor and beyond.\n- − Boosting growth through scalable platforms: Scale our customerfacing platforms and build new operating platforms to grow our business volume and margin.\n- − Deepening the global vertical integration and execution of agility: Verticalize operating models across lines of business to unleash value from our skills and scale.\n- − Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience: Retain industryleading financial strength and unlock further value creation potential through an improved risk/return profile and an active management and reduction of tail-risk exposure. Our focus on capital resilience is matched with a focus on talent development and diversity that also strengthens our organizational resilience.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on ensuring the integrity of the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\nOur financial strength renders us resilient against market stress, while our ongoing transformation creates capabilities allowing us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment. For example:\n\n- − We are continuously simplifying our products and processes, harmonizing them across our businesses to consequently exploit economies of scale.\n- − We scale our customer-facing platforms (e.g., Mobility, Health, and Travel) and integrate our business models with digital marketplaces for customers and business partners (e.g., claims).\n- − Building on a strong customer base, a deep understanding of customer needs, and excellence in distribution, we strive to achieve customer loyalty leadership in all countries we operate in.\n- − In fast-growing regions, including Asia-Pacific, we are wellpositioned to capture growth opportunities from increasing customer demand for Health & Protection.\n- − Worldwide, there is growth potential from providing our asset management clients (institutional and retail) with opportunities to invest in both private and public markets, pursue returns commensurate with their stated risk appetites, and engage in various investment strategies, be they equity, fixed income or alternatives.\n- − Building on our strong footprint in Europe, we aim to profit from ongoing consolidations, transform the capital productivity of in force businesses, and gain market share in previously unexploited markets.\n- − Together with our partners, we capture opportunities in bancassurance as well as future embedded insurance solutions across products and geographies, tapping into new customer segments.\n- − We are enhancing Allianz's unit-linked platform by converging the Group factory expertise from Life Insurance and Asset Management.\n- − We are focusing on sustainability by realizing ESG-based investment products, social value-added insurance coverages (e.g., flood, earthquake, and storm) and health prevention products (e.g., oncological).\n\nIn a continuously evolving market where the demands of customers constantly change, our knowledge of the industry and our expertise in product development and risk management offers us great opportunities to create timely customer-focused solutions.\n\n### **Supervisory Board and Board of Management**\n\nOur approach to risk governance permits the integrated management of local and global risks and ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and groupwide responsibilities.\n\nThe Board of Management formulates business objectives and sets a corresponding business strategy, risk strategy, and investment strategy. It also defines risk limits and allocates risk capital to the business activities within the Allianz Group. The core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Management. The Board of Management reports to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management activities. The following committees support the Board and the Supervisory Board on risk issues:\n\n### **Supervisory Board Risk Committee**\n\nThe Supervisory Board Risk Committee reports to the Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk management framework. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as general risks and specific risk exposures, and ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the paragraph \"Risk Committee\" in the [Supervisory Board Report.](#page-5-0)\n\n### **Group Finance and Risk Committee**\n\nIn the context of the Group's Committee Framework, the Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) reports to the Board of Management and provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limit-setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Management, and approves major financing and capital management transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including strategic asset allocation for the different business segments.\n\n#### **Overall risk organization and roles in risk management**\n\nA comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved via the Policy Framework by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appetite, limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of riskrelated information (e.g., to the Board of Management via the Management Reporting) and a disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution at both the global level (Board of Management of Allianz SE) and local levels (i.e., the Operating and Legal Entities).\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Three Lines of Defense model, as a general principle, the responsibility for the First Line of Defense rests with business managers in the related undertaking. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. The Second Line of Defense is made up of independent global oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board of Management in defining the risk frameworks within which the business can operate. Group Audit forms the Third Line of Defense, independently and regularly reviewing risk governance implementation, compliance with risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our internal control system, all functions are obliged to cooperate and exchange necessary information and advice. Given that control activities may be exercised by staff in different organizational units, appropriate mechanisms are in place between the control functions to allow fully informed and educated decision-making.\n\n#### **Group Risk Management function**\n\nGroup Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer, who also serves as the Chief Risk Officer of Allianz SE. Group Risk supports Allianz SE's Board of Management, including its committees, by performing various analyses, communicating information related to risk management, and preparing and implementing committee decisions.\n\nGroup Risk also supports the Board of Management in developing the risk management framework – which covers risk governance, risk strategy and appetite – and risk monitoring and reporting. Group Risk's operational responsibility encompasses assessing risks across all risk categories and monitoring limits and accumulations ofspecific risks across businesslines, including natural and human-caused (regulatory terminology: man-made) disasters and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.\n\nGroup Risk strengthens and maintains the Group's risk network through regular and close interaction with the management of related undertakings and with other key stakeholders, such as the local finance, risk, actuarial, underwriting, and investment departments. A strong group-wide risk network enables the Allianz Group to influence risk culture across the Group, identify risks at an early stage, and make management aware of these risks.\n\n#### **Related undertakings**\n\nRelated undertakings are responsible for their own risk management, including adherence to both external requirements (for example, those imposed by local regulators) and internal standards. Their Boards of Management are responsible for setting and approving a local risk strategy − supporting the Group's risk strategy − during the annual Strategic and Planning Dialogues with the Group and for ensuring adherence to their risk strategy.\n\nThe insurance and asset management operations of our related undertakings are subject to regular reviews in the context of the groupwide internal risk management and control system. The control measures are accompanied by local Risk Management functions, headed by Chief Risk Officers, which are independent from business line management. The Risk Management functions run riskmonitoring and -controlling processes, locally set up by the respective entities. Furthermore, the local activities are subject to additional reviews by regional entities, or the Allianz Asset Management GmbH for asset management. This ensures the adherence to Group requirements and the related reporting. A local Risk Committee supports both the Board of Management (or an equivalent executive committee) and the Chief Risk Officer by acting as the primary risk monitoring and controlling body.\n\nConsistent implementation of the Group's risk management framework in the related undertakings, including regular dialogue between the Group and the entity, is ensured, for example, through Group Risk representation on local Risk Committees (or equivalent), and through regular assessment of the appropriateness of the local risk management framework and performance of the Chief Risk Officers by Group Risk. Moreover, the Group Chief Risk Officer must be consulted on decisions regarding the staffing, objectives, and performance evaluation of local Chief Risk Officers. To further enhance the regular dialogue at management level focusing on the internal control environment, the Group is implementing the Governance and Controls Dialogue as one key instrument that should further enhance the already existing strong strategic and financial planning procedures known as the Strategic Dialogue and the Planning Dialogue. The Governance and Controls Dialogue will be enabled by an integrated Governance and Controls Dashboard, to assure a holistic overview of the risk landscape as well as external factors that may be potential risk drivers.\n\n#### **Other functions and bodies**\n\nIn addition to Group Risk and the local Risk Management functions, legal, compliance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and the entity levels constitute additional components of the Second Line of Defense.\n\nGroup Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition, Group Compliance – in conjunction with Group Legal and other experts involved – is responsible for integrity management, which aims to protect the Allianz Group as well as Allianz SE and our other related undertakings and employees from regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nGroup Compliance has defined preventive, detective, and responsive controls for the assigned compliance risk areas, which are based on requirements specified in the compliance standards and Code of Conduct. A compliance control catalog, including the development of control objectives arising from the various corporate compliance guidelines, as well as a cataloging of normative risk scenarios and defined key control activities, are available.\n\nGroup Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing risks of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management system. The latter includes joining Group Risk in a discipline to regularly monitor internal risk capital models, assumptions, and parameters – as well as their changes. It also includes providing support regarding capital efficiency management, contributing to the modeling of insurance risk capital, and supporting the identification of underwriting risks via independent reserve reviews.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Risk-based steering and risk management[1](#page-134-0)\n\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks, including market, credit, underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\nAllianz's Asset Management business segment is primarily exposed to operational risk, reputational risk, and business risk. Market and credit risk are primarily borne by the segment's underlying investors, be they internal or third-party clients.\n\nWe consider diversification across different business segments, lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any disproportionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the Group, our risk profile is measured and steered based on our approved Solvency II internal model<sup>2</sup>. We have introduced a target solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.\n\nUnlike the insurance business, which is balance-sheet sensitive, our Asset Management business is mainly a cash flow business. Therefore, the risk of the Asset Management business segment is also analyzed through the impact of pre-defined material stress scenarios on the operating profit. These are one component in a system of key risk indicators for Asset Management and are regularly monitored. These risk limits are reviewed on a regular basis with First Line of Defense business owners, confirming the pre-assessments derived by the entity's Risk Management functions. These risk limits (sometimes called risk bearing capacity thresholds) are presented to the underlying Risk Committee and are ultimately ratified by the Audit Committees and/or Executive Management Boards.\n\nIn addition, central elements of Allianz's dividend policy are linked to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model. This helps us to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\n2\\_From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems our model to be \"partial\" because not all our entities use the internal model. Some of our smaller insurance entities report under the standard formula and others apply third country equivalence. For asset management, banking, and\n\nAllianz steers its business portfolio taking a comprehensive view of risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits based on our internal model. The Life/Health business segment is steered – in addition to the Return on Equity – by a return on risk capital[3](#page-134-0) (RoRC) approach for new business at the product level, while for the Property-Casualty business segment a return on equity (RoE insurance) at the portfolio level is used.\n\nRoRC and RoE insurance are indicators that allow us to identify profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis. For new Life/Health insurance business, RoRC reflects the expected average return against the capital commitment over the lifetime of the products and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions. For Property-Casualty insurance business, the RoE insurance reflects the return against the underlying equity which is allocated to the specific portfolios based on the respective risk capital requirements. This allows us to take appropriate risk-based decisions.\n\nConsistent with industry practices, the Asset Management business segment is measured on its efficiency based upon cost to income, i.e., the Cost Income Ratio (CIR).\n\nAs a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in the steering of the insurance business, and its application satisfies the socalled \"use test\" requirement under Solvency II.\n\nQualitative assessments as part of the Insurance and Asset Management risk framework include Top Risk Assessments, as well as group-challenged self-assessments and selected group reviews of the maturity of the local risk management systems and the adherence to the risk policy framework. Key results of the entities' qualitative risk assessments are reported to the Group on a regular basis.\n\nAs an inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums from our policyholders and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting investment portfolios back the future claims payments and benefits to our customers. In addition, we also invest shareholders' capital, which is required to support the business. Finally, we use derivatives, mostly to hedge our portfolio against adverse market movements (for example, protective puts) or to reduce our reinvestment risk (for example, by using forwards, swaps, or\n\nInstitutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), sectoral requirements are applied. Without loss of generality, we might use the term internal model in the following chapters, e.g., in case of descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on processes with respect to the internal model components.\n\n<span id=\"page-134-1\"></span><span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>swaptions). Asset/liability management (ALM) decisions are taken based on the internal model, considering both the risks and the returns on the financial market.\n\nAs the fair values of our investment portfolios and liabilities depend on the changes observed in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. The long-dated liabilities in our Life/Health business segment and those attributable to internal pensions contribute to interest rate risk, in particular when they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied volatilities, and currencies, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models[4](#page-134-1) for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the sorted portfolio profit and loss distribution at a certain confidence level (99.5 %) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR). For entities modeled using the standard formula, the market risk is based on aggregating the losses under specified standard formula shock scenarios.\n\nStrategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits – including stand-alone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits, and foreign exchange exposure limits – are defined for the Group, Allianz SE, and the other related undertakings. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include escalation to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nFurthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging activities, due to the exposure to fair-value options embedded in our life insurance products. In addition, we optimize our in-force portfolio through transactional levers, such as partly or entirely divesting discontinued products and businesses; structural levers, such as adjusting the product mix; and operational levers, such as partnering with specialists to manage these books of legacy products, also called life back books.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<sup>3</sup>\\_The return on risk capital is defined as the present value of future real-world profits on the capital requirement (including buffer to regulatory requirements) held at the local level.\n\n<sup>4</sup>\\_Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic cash flow models, following IAS 19 principles.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, guidelines are provided by the Group regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives. Compliance with these guidelines is controlled by the risk and controlling functions at Allianz SE and the other operating entities.\n\nWith respect to investment assets of the Property-Casualty and Life/Health business segments managed by Allianz's asset managers, guidelines applicable to our insurance undertakings must be clearly elaborated as part of the asset managers' client investment guidelines. Notwithstanding the above, portfolios managed by Allianz's asset managers for the benefit of third-party investment clients must adhere to the investment frameworks and constraints as defined by and agreed with them.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nAllianz is a liability-driven investor. We may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts, if the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities. This risk is higher for long-dated life investment and savings products as well as for internal pensions, with a significant part of the Life/Health business segment's interest rate risk coming from Western Europe, mainly from traditional life insurance products with guarantees. Conversely, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our asset/liability management process and controlled via interest rate sensitivity and duration mismatch limits for the Group and the local entities.\n\n### **Inflation risk**\n\nWe are exposed to changing inflation rates, predominantly due to our Property-Casualty insurance obligations but also due to inflationindexed internal pension obligations. While inflation assumptions are taken into account in our underwriting, unexpected rising rates of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities; conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk that inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our internal model. Potential severe structural breaks are monitored via historical and ad-hoc stress tests. Measures have been taken to manage currently observed elevated inflation levels. On the Property-Casualty side, this includes continuous monitoring of claims inflation, sufficient provisioning, and timely adjustments of premium rates to reflect both actual and expected inflation.\n\n### **Equity risk**\n\nInsurance-focused Allianz entities may hold equity investments to diversify their portfolios and to take advantage of expected long-term returns. Strategic asset allocation benchmarks, investment and equity sensitivity limits are used to monitor and manage these exposures. In addition, equity investments fall within the scope of the credit risk platform to avoid single-name risk concentrations. Risks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As stock markets might also increase, opportunities may arise from equity investments in those events.\n\n### **Credit spread risk**\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liabilitydriven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity. This implies that we are less affected economically by short-term changes in market prices. In our capacity as a long-term investor, this gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component.\n\n### **Currency risk**\n\nAllianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group typically invest in assets which are denominated in the same currency as their liabilities. However, some foreign currency exposures are allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign currency risk comes from our non-euro Group companies: Whenever the euro strengthens, the euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsidiaries will decline from an Allianz Group and Allianz SE perspective; however, at the same time, the capital requirements in euro will decrease, partially mitigating the total impact on Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's capitalization. Based on the Allianz Group's foreign exchange management limit framework, currency risk is monitored and managed at the levels of the Allianz Group, Allianz SE, and the other operating entities of the Allianz Group.\n\n### **Real estate risk**\n\nDespite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suitable addition to our investment portfolio due to good diversification benefits, as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable, long-term cash flows.\n\nAllianz's Group Investment Committee has defined a framework for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real estate loan investments. These standards outline diversification targets, minimum-return thresholds, and other qualitative and quantitative requirements. All transactions that do not meet these standards or have a total investment volume (including costs) exceeding a defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group Risk and other Group center functions. In addition, all applicable limits must be respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset allocation as well as its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an investing entity's portfolio.\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties (\"migration risk\") or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (\"default risk\").\n\nThe Group's credit risk profile originates from three sources: our investment portfolio, our credit insurance business, and our external reinsurance.\n\n- − Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obligor. However, losses due to credit events can be shared with the policyholder for certain life insurance products.\n- − Credit insurance: Credit risk arises from potential claim payments on limits granted by Allianz Trade to its policyholders. Allianz Trade insures its policyholders against credit risk associated with short-term trade credits advanced to policyholder's clients. When the client of the policyholder is unable to meet its payment obligations, Allianz Trade indemnifies the loss to the policyholder.\n- − Reinsurance: Credit risk arises from potential losses from nonrecoverability of reinsurance receivables or due to default on benefits under in force reinsurance treaties. Our reinsurance partners are carefully selected by a dedicated team. Besides focusing on companies with strong credit profiles, we may also require letters of credit, cash deposits, funds withheld, or assets held in trust, or other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process. The central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies, and internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied.\n\nThe loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure concentrations per obligor segment. The loss profiles are calculated at different levels of the Allianz Group, and then fed into the internal model at each level for further aggregation across sources of risk to derive diversified credit risk.\n\nOur credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Allianz Trade, based on a proprietary model component which is a local adaptation of the central internal credit risk model. Allianz Trade's loss profile is integrated in the Group's internal credit risk model to capture the concentration and diversification effects.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CrisP<sup>1</sup>) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group, Allianz SE, and other operating-entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit actions and provides notification services featuring the quick and broad communication of credit-related decisions across the Group.\n\nClearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's perspective (i.e., the maximum concentration limit), which are adopted by Allianz SE and serve as maximum local limits for the other operating entities, takes into account the Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure as well as the overall risk strategy.\n\nApart from risks from internal pensions, underwriting risk consists of premium and reserve risks in the Property-Casualty business segment[2](#page-136-0) as well as biometric risks in the Life/Health business segment[3](#page-136-0) and underwriting risks are not relevant for the Asset Management business segment and our banking operations.\n\n### **Property-Casualty**\n\nThe Property-Casualty primary and reinsurance business of the Allianz Group is exposed to premium-risk-related adverse developments in the current year's new and renewed business, as well as to reserve risks related to the business in force.\n\n### **Premium risk**\n\nAs part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive premiums from our customers and provide insurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios. Premium risk can be mitigated by reinsurance as well as by technical excellence in underwriting. Assessing risks as part of the underwriting process is therefore a key element of our risk management framework. There are clear underwriting limits and restrictions which are defined centrally and applied across the Group.\n\nPremium risk is subdivided into three categories: natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate loss distribution models for attritional losses. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, and floods represent a significant challenge for risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses. Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror events and man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber incidents and industrial concentrations.\n\n<span id=\"page-136-0\"></span>These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n#### **Reserve risk**\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we would experience a gain or loss dependent on the assumptions applied for the estimate. In addition, the risk of inflation volatility deviating from historical observations and of changes in yield curves is covered in the specific market risk modules.\n\nSimilar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actuarial models. The reserve distributions derived are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of unexpected reserve volatility, Allianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group constantly monitor the development of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, related undertakings generally conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses and Group representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings.\n\nRetrocession is another important instrument to mitigate reserve risk.\n\n### **Life/Health**\n\nUnderwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks) include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life expectancies of the insured.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several parameters – such as assumptions on future mortality rates, or morbidity claims – the actual development may differ from the expected one. For example, lower-than-expected mortality rates would lead to additional annuity payments in the future. However, \n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nbeneficial deviations are also possible; for example, a trend towards healthier lifestyles will most likely result in lower overall health insurance claims.\n\nWe measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing, where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and pandemic risk scenarios on the other. Depending on the nature and complexity of the risks involved, our health business is represented in the internal model according to Property-Casualty or Life/Health calculation methods and is therefore included in the relevant Property-Casualty and Life/Health figures accordingly. However, most of our health business is attributable to the Life/Health business segment.\n\nBusiness risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks. They are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by the Property-Casualty and the Asset Management business. Cost risks are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering insurance policies – or investment management expenses for portfolio management – are higher than expected or that new business volume decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs. Business risk is measured relative to baseline plans.\n\nFor the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in exercising their contractual options, such as, for instance, early termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and annuity take-up options.\n\nAssumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with accepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment. These are used as a basis to determine the economic impact of policyholder behavior under different scenarios within our internal model.\n\nThe potential interaction between market risks (in particular interest rate risk) and lapse risk is covered by two different modeling aspects:\n\n− Financial rationality: The Life/Health cash flow models generally contain a dynamic modeling of lapse where the best estimate lapse rate is increased if market returns are significantly higher than the overall return of the insurance policy and vice versa.\n\n− Cross effects: This part takes into account that a combined impact of a market rate change and a lapse rate change could deviate significantly from the sum of the two impacts.\n\nOperational risks refer to losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, including the following:\n\n- − \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\": potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations or from the design of products. Examples include mis-selling, non-compliance with internal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These losses tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have a high financial (and reputational) impact.\n- − \"Execution, Delivery, and Process Management\": potential losses arising from transaction or process management failures. Examples include interest and penalties from non-payment or underpayment of taxes, or losses associated with broker and agent distribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher frequency but with little financial impact (although single large-loss events can occur).\n- − Other operational risks including, for example, internal or external fraud, financial misstatement risk, IT risks (such as a cybersecurity incident causing limited availability, loss of confidentiality or integrity, or regulatory fines[1](#page-137-0)), IT-related risks (such as improper delivery/design or operational stability), a potential failure at our outsourcing partners causing a disruption to our working environment, etc.\n\nIn the last year, the following two operational risks related to IT have gained in importance in particular:\n\nThe first operational risk results from fast developments in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) including generative AI. AI can help Allianz to further improve customer services and internal processes but also comes with new operational risks: Public and regulatory concerns about discriminating AI and \"Black Box AI\" triggered various regulatory initiatives by supervisory authorities and regulators across the globe, especially the upcoming European Union AI Act, which is expected to be finalized in 2024. Allianz addresses these new legal and reputational risks seriously with its AI governance framework, <span id=\"page-137-0\"></span>which is already rolled out in various OEs. It basically includes a practical guidance for AI promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, human agency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI solutions. Privacy and ethics impact assessments help to implement these AI principles on a case-by-case basis. These activities are supported by various training and awareness campaigns for Allianz employees, and by a data advisory board preparing decisions for the Board of Management in the area of AI and data ethics. The Allianz AI governance framework will be further adjusted, especially to implement the European Union AI Act in its final version, and structurally rolled out in the operating entities.\n\nThe second operational risk is compliance with rising regulatory requirements on the management of IT risks. In the second quarter 2022, BaFin conducted an audit on the implementation of the supervisory requirements for insurance on IT (VAIT) at Allianz SE, with the new version published on 3 March 2022. To address the findings, Allianz SE has set up a program under the lead of the division \"Operations, IT and Organization\" and approved and submitted to BaFin a corresponding remediation plan. The remediation plan has been accepted by BaFin.\n\nAdditional recent examples are the European Commission's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and similar requirements from local regulators relevant for the Allianz Group. To achieve compliance with the large number of very granular DORA standards, an extensive program coordinated by Group Protection & Resilience was initiated during 2023. The program aims to implement adequate solutions by January 2025, when the requirements set by the act need to be effectively met by Allianz. Group Risk is participating in the project and is actively involved in contributing to the design required by DORA.\n\nIn the last year, one operational risk related to IT has reduced in importance. The project risk related to the Allianz Group's IT transformation program, which aimed at accelerating complexity reduction and achieving additional synergy effects and cost savings in IT, was reduced due to formal closure of the program and transfer of remaining activities to a local project in the Asia region. The program was supported with a tailored risk assessment approach, which will now happen in a similar way for the local project. Risks at all levels of the program – at operating entities, business areas and the global program – were independently identified, assessed, and will – where necessary – continue to be managed, and monitored in a harmonized way.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allianz Group's operational risk primarily refers to losses in either the insurance or the asset management business, or both.\n\nThe Group's operational risk capital is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the categories \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\" and \"Execution, Delivery, and Process Management\". With regard to the largest category \"Clients, Products, and Business Practices\", key external drivers are changes in laws and regulations. Internal drivers reflect potential failures of internal processes. These drivers are considered in the local scenario analyses.\n\nOperational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based approach based on expert judgment, as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz has developed a consistent operational risk management framework, which is applied across the Group based on proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles and responsibilities as well as management processes and methods: Local risk managers at Allianz SE and at the other operating entities of the Allianz Group, in their capacity as Second Line of Defense, identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies via a dialogue with the First Line of Defense, report operational risk events in a central database, and ensure that the framework is implemented in their respective operating entity.\n\nThis framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and dedicated compliance programs monitored by compliance functions across the Allianz Group. The risk of financial misstatement is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management programs to protect critical business functions from these events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cybersecurity, cyber insurance that Allianz buys from third-party insurers, and a variety of ongoing control activities, developed and implemented along the following main themes: slow down hackers, increase threat detection, reduce the damage of attacks, and enhance the skills as well as the organizational structure.\n\nWith regards to the last year, in particularIT risk management and information and cybersecurity were further improved via implementation of the following strategic themes, which were derived from both observed and anticipated risks, considering the strategic outlook of information security, the threat landscape, and industry trends: (1) protection of digital identity, (2) security service health, (3) cyber resilience.\n\nDue to the particular importance of operational risks for the Asset Management business, a key task for the local Risk Management functions in the related entities is a regular monitoring of the internal controls attached to material processes. This is also supported by the introduction of the concept on Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM).\n\nThe ICS for operational risk encompasses the management of compliance, financial reporting, and other operational risks. The effectiveness of this internal control system is monitored along two dimensions:\n\n- − Monitoring the effective implementation of the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) framework, which is progressively replacing the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) framework. If correctly implemented, these frameworks ensure that risks are identified in time, and controls are appropriately set up and tested frequently to identify potential weaknesses or gaps in the internal control system.\n- − Monitoring the resolution of identified weaknesses in the internal control system.\n\nNFRM strengthens the internal control system by using a new risk taxonomy consistent across the Group, which helps to aggregate the risks at Group level, and by using an even more rigorous testing approach. It is being rolled out in so-called waves with close monitoring by Group Risk and Group Compliance. Insurance and Asset Management entities of the first two waves – 44 operating entities out of 67 – have already undergone important implementation steps in 2023 to further bolster assurance activities. Operating entities part of the last wave 3 have continued to apply the IRCS framework and will implement NFRM in 2024.\n\nThe full implementation of the new framework across the Group is expected to be completed by year-end 2024. Meanwhile, Group Risk and Group Compliance are closely monitoring all waves, seamlessly bridging an effective migration between IRCS and NFRM.\n\nThe NFRM is an integral part of the overall ICS, whose fundamentals are described in the section \"Risk Governance System and Internal Control System\".\n\nThe NFRM is the framework by which the Second Line of Defense supports and facilitates the fulfillment of First Line of Defense responsibility to implement an adequate and effective system for managing Non-Financial Risks. The NFRM aims to strengthen the control system by using a harmonized methodology to:\n\n- − Achieve a consistent and commonly accepted definition of risks that fall under the category Non-Financial Risk, via establishing a set of non-financial risk vectors.\n- − Facilitate the implementation of adequate controls via an NFRM control catalog, consisting of control objectives, risk scenarios, and exemplary key controls.\n- − Ensure a robust testing of these controls, using a systematic riskbased approach.\n\nTo achieve these targets, NFRM has connected and evolved already existing pillars and tools of the Allianz Risk Management and Internal Control System framework, e.g., the Top Risk Assessment (TRA) methodology, the Integrated Risk and Control (IRCS) framework, and the use of internal and external operational loss events.\n\nThe NFRM framework has the following key features:\n\n- − Objective data is used through a consistent methodology to facilitate a baseline assessment of non-financial risks.\n- − An assessment of top non-financial risks prioritizes risks to better allocate resources.\n- − A process-level view is used to approach risks and controls from a business view, and to facilitate integrated assurance.\n- − Standardized key controls are defined to support compliance and risk management by design, and to enforce integrated assurance and testing rigor.\n\nFundamental to the NFRM is the concept of a holistic approach. While there are several different sources of operational risks, the process towards the management of the risks always follows the same core principle. This is that operational risks must be identified, assessed, and prioritized, and underlying mitigating controls have to be effective. This is the basic premise behind establishing an integrated approach.\n\nAt the Allianz Group level, it is important to monitor the quality of the local implementation of this framework as a means of ensuring that internal control system weaknesses are identified prior to the occurrence of operational risk events (ex-ante).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo fulfill this objective, Allianz relies on a methodology known as the OE control environment rating. The OE control environment rating evaluates the effectiveness of the framework at the operating entity level by leveraging several sources of data and KPIs, which are then further enhanced via certain qualitative criteria.\n\nAdditionally, an Allianz group-wide Executive Accountability Regime (EAR) is in place to further support the integration of risk management into business processes. It is essential that the Board of Management demonstrates a strong risk culture to support this integration – they lead by example in order to make clear throughout the business that the management of risks is an important factor when it comes to the achievement of business objectives.\n\nFor a selection of key executives, the EAR formalizes clear accountability and ownership for risk management through tailored individual accountability statements, which concretely outline rolespecific responsibilities to reinforce the Allianz purpose and strategy in thinking and behavior across Allianz, as well as to mitigate key risks. In addition, to reinforce these accountabilities amongst business leaders, compliance with internal and external regulations as well as vigilance in living the Group's risk culture is taken into account when determining performance. In 2023, the EAR has been further enhanced to include a minimum set of clearly defined key indicators to measure OE management's timely responsiveness in the areas of Risk, Compliance, Legal, Data Privacy, Audit, and People & Culture. These quantitative indicators are complemented with a holistic qualitative assessment.\n\nThere are risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital. These risks are therefore not considered in the internal model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risk.\n\n### **Strategic risk**\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's Top Risk Assessment process and discussed in various Board of Management-level committees (for example, GFRC). We also monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe most important strategic risks are related to the value creation levers, which focus on three themes: Growth, Margin Expansion, and Capital Efficiency. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the value creation leversis monitored and evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogues between the Allianz Group and Allianz SE and the other related undertakings.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows.\n\nThe liquidity risk profile of Allianz predominantly originates from the uncertainty about the volume and timing of cash needs from insurances liabilities. This relates especially to:\n\n- − Coverage of various types of catastrophes in the Property-Casualty business, with the frequency of such events anticipated to increase going forward as a result of the unfolding climate change effects.\n- − Mass lapse events or rising lapse rates in the Life/Health insurance business, especially in combination with changes in the relevant capital market environment.\n\nMajor risks can also result from derivative transactions used by Allianz to hedge specific market risks.\n\nAllianz is exposed to liquidity risk as well due to large operational risk events, which may potentially result in significant cash outflows.\n\nAnother source of liquidity risk for Allianz are potential regulatory actions by local supervisors, which may reduce dividends from subsidiaries to the Group (e.g., due to global events such as those partially observed during the COVID-19 crisis).\n\nEach legal entity of the Allianz Group measures and manages liquidity risk locally, using asset/liability management systems designed to ensure that assets and liabilities are adequately matched. Local investment strategies particularly focus on the quality of the investments and ensure a significant portion of liquid assets (e.g., highrated government bonds or covered bonds) in the portfolios. In the course of the liquidity planning, liquidity sources (e.g., cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (e.g., payments due to insurance claims and expenses) are reconciled under a best-estimate plan, as well as under adverse idiosyncratic and systemic liquidity scenarios with time horizons of up to 12 months, to allow for a consistent view on liquidity risk across the Group. These analyses are predominantly performed at legal entity level and are monitored by the Group for large- and mid-sized units.\n\nThe annual and the high-level three-year cash flow plan for Allianz SE and the Holding and Treasury reportable segment reflect the overall operating, financing, and investing strategy of the Allianz Group. The liquidity stress-testing framework of Allianz SE is identical to that of the other legal entities. Major contingent liquidity requirements arise mainly from market risk scenarios for Allianz SE and its subsidiaries, from the non-availability of external capital markets, and from reinsurance risk scenarios for Allianz SE.\n\nIn addition, the cash position of the Group cash pool investment portfolio is monitored and forecast on a daily basis.\n\nIn the liquidity risk measurement process, early warning and limit thresholds are applied to regularly measure the local (stressed) liquidity position, inform senior management, and decide on actions if needed.\n\nThe management of Allianz's liquidity risk at a local level is facilitated by a dedicated governance and organizational setup. In general, the First Line of Defense is responsible for managing liquidity risk. Monitoring of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the local Risk Management functions, and potential liquidity gaps are reported to the respective local boards of management.\n\n### **Reputational risk**\n\nAllianz's reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas such as product quality, corporate governance, financial performance, customer service, employee relations, intellectual capital, and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the Allianz SE share price, the value of the in-force business, or the value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in the eyes of internal or external stakeholders.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the annual Top Risk Assessment process, undertaken by the Allianz Group and all operating entities. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk strategy for the most significant risks and their potential reputational impact.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **ESG risks**\n\nEnvironmental, social or governance events and conditions (ESG factors), such as climate change, loss of biodiversity or human rights abuses, are increasingly becoming a relevant source of adverse impacts on our balance sheet, profitability or reputation. These ESGrelated risks are characterized by their transversal nature, meaning they may materialize within any of Allianz's existing risk categories (e.g., market risk, underwriting risk, operational risk) as either a consequence of societal responses to ESG factors – including regulatory changes, litigation, technological developments and changes in human behavior – or due to events causing physical damage, such as droughts, floods or storms, whereby the magnitude or likelihood is attributable to an ESG factor.\n\nAllianz's strategy for the management of these risks begins with establishing a comprehensive understanding of all the ways ESG factors can trigger adverse events within the investment, underwriting, and operations areas of our business, as well as from a broader reputational perspective. For this purpose, a dedicated ESG risk inventory has been established and a corresponding risk assessment performed, which enables us to take a risk-based view in terms of evaluating the adequacy of mitigation measures in place.\n\nESG-related mitigation measures may vary substantially, depending on the precise nature of the underlying risk, ranging from establishment of specific controls at the business process level through to adjustments in Allianz's long-term business strategy. Given that all adverse impacts attributable to ESG factors are ultimately realized within one of Allianz's existing risk categories, we aim – to the greatest extent possible – to embed the identification and management of these risks directly within risk management processes already in place.\n\nAt the Group level, the GFRC is responsible for overseeing ESGrelated risks. In addition, a Group Sustainability Board is in place, which is responsible for Allianz's overall ESG strategy and for steering the integration of ESG aspects into core investment and insurance activities.\n\nFor a broader perspective on our key ESG integration processes, please refer to the sections \"Sustainability integration approach\" and \"Transition plan and strategy\" in th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0) \n\nWith respect to consideration of ESG risks in the management of third-party assets, our asset managers AllianzGI and PIMCO each have their own global ESG framework, which supports their clientderived objectives of ESG investing, while complying with globally and locally relevant rules and regulations.\n\n### **Climate change**\n\nWithin the broad scope of ESG, climate change is currently the ESG factor of primary emphasis, both in terms of regulatory focus and potential to materially influence our risk profile over a short- to midterm and long-term horizon. Commensurate with this emphasis, an assessment of Allianz's climate change-related risks has been conducted during 2023, including both a qualitative risk assessment following the structure of the ESG risk inventory, as well as quantitative scenario analyses and stress-testing.\n\nFor information about the climate change risk management methodology, the outcome of the assessments and next steps, please refer to the section \"Climate-related risks\" in th[e Non-Financial Statement.](#page-55-0)\n\n## Internal risk capital framework[1](#page-140-0)\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization. We calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk capital across all business segments on a quarterly basis. We also regularly project risk capital requirements between reporting periods in times of financial market turbulence.\n\nFor the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules in that it comprises our approved internal model covering Allianz SE and all other major insurance operations. Other entities are reflected based on standard formula results, others under the deduction and aggregation approach as well as on sectoral requirements (e.g., Asset Management) or local requirements for non-insurance operations, in accordance with the Solvency II framework.\n\n### **Internal model**\n\nOur internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss of portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe <span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>(\"holding period\", set at one year) and probability of occurrence (\"confidence level\", set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories (\"sources of risk\") modeled and calculate the portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mitigating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe risk capital required is defined as the difference between the current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we consider the impact of a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and in aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios representing historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests on a monthly basis to reflect current political and financial developments, and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.\n\n### **Coverage of the risk capital calculations**\n\nThe Allianz Group's internal model to calculate our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) covers all major insurance operations[2](#page-140-0). This includes both relevant assets (including fixed income, equities, real estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all current and planned technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt, and other liabilities). For with-profit products in the Life/Health business segment, the options and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts – including policyholder behavior – are taken into account.\n\nSmaller related undertakings in the European Economic Area which are not covered by the internal model are reflected with their standard formula results. Until the third quarter 2023, the Solvency Capital Requirements for certain smaller insurance undertakings outside the European Economic Area with only immaterial impact on the Group's risk profile were accounted for at the level of Allianz Group by means of book value deduction[3](#page-140-0). Due to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter 2023, the book value deduction approach is no longer used for these entities. Instead, the contribution of the solvency capital requirement from these entities to the Group is derived through experience values from the standard model, in alignment with the regulator.\n\n3\\_Under book value deduction, the book value of the respective entity is deducted from eligible Own Funds of the Group.\n\n[1](#page-142-0)\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the notes to \n2\\_Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America is based on third-country equivalence. the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk capital related to our European banking operations is allocated to the Corporate and Other business segment and calculated based on the approach applied by banks in accordance with the local requirements resulting from the Basel regulation (Basel standards). As the impact on the Group's total Solvency Capital Requirement is minor, risk management for the banking operations is not discussed in greater detail.\n\nFor our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal risk capital requirements based on sectoral regulatory capital requirements.\n\nIn view of the above, Allianz's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks not specifically covered by the internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n### **Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment**\n\nWhen calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assumptions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in determining and discounting future cash flows. For liability valuation, we apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to extrapolate the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor.\n\nIn addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility adjustment (VA) in most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows of our insurance liabilities are largely predictable. The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nWe take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful for long-term investors than the default risk. Allianz also models the volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model, which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard formula. For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA would react in practice; however, we base the movement on our own portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio. To account for this deviation, Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment. Validation is performed regularly to verify the appropriateness and prudency of the approach.\n\n### **Valuation assumptions: replicating portfolios**\n\nWe replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business. This technique enables us to represent all product-related options and guarantees, both contractual and discretionary, by means of standard financial instruments. In the risk calculation, we use the replicating portfolio − together with a Least Square Monte Carlo approach for risks that are not covered by the replication − to determine and revalue these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios.\n\n### **Diversification and correlation assumptions**\n\nAs Allianz is an integrated financial services provider offering a variety of products across different business segments and geographic regions, diversification is key to our business model.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors include regions (e.g., windstorm in Australia vs. windstorm in Germany), risk categories (e.g., market risk vs. underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (e.g., commercial vs. personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ultimately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the investment or (re)insurance products in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event in Australia can be considered to be highly independent of a change in credit spreads for a French government bond held as investment.\n\nThe internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results at the Group level, Allianz SE level, or at the level of other Group companies. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nWhere possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering observations over more than a decade. In cases where historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correlations are set by the Correlation Settings Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judgment, we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n### **Actuarial assumptions**\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior, expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, additionally considering recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. Our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework incorporates comprehensive processes and controls to ensure the reliability of these assumptions.\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for example, in an unprecedented crisis or as a possible result of severe structural breaks resulting from climate change, our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore, we validate the model and parameters through sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. To ensure that the model is validated adequately, we have established an Independent Validation Unit (IVU) within Group Risk, responsible for validating our internal model within a comprehensive model validation process. Any limitations identified during the validation process are remedied after consultation with the Group regulator. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nThe construction and application of the replicating portfolios mentioned are subject to the set of replicating instruments that are available and might be too simple or restrictive to capture all factors affecting the change in value of liabilities. As with other model components, the replication framework is subject to independent \n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nvalidation and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data and process quality controls. Therefore, we believe that our liabilities are adequately represented by the replicating portfolios.\n\nSince the internal model takes into account the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible – notably in distressed financial markets – to either obtain a current market price or to apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nIn 2023, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in the course of our consultations with regulators.\n\nThe net impact of regulatory and model changes on the Solvency II risk capital of the Group in 2023 was € 2.9 bn.\n\n#### The most important changes are:\n\n- − Inclusion of capital requirements for certain previously not modeled minor non-EEA insurance entities[1](#page-142-0), including currency risk (impact: € 3.0 bn).\n- − Change in the modeling of contingent capital reinsurance at Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG (€ 0.2 bn).\n- − Dynamic inflation extrapolation, which improves the inflation modeling by refining both the coverage of the term structure and the extrapolation to the central bank's long-term inflation target (€ (0.3) bn).\n\n<span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>In addition, in an effort to enhance the explanatory power of the risk capital movement analyses, our approach for allocating the risk capital from Group insurance entities which are modeled based on the Solvency II standard formula was improved. In the refined approach, the risk contributions to single risk categories are better aligned to the risk profile of the standard formula entities, and the diversification as well as the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes in the standard formula are more appropriately reflected. The change in the allocation approach does not impact the total SCR of the Allianz Group, but it increases all contributions of these standard formula entities to the single risk categories.\n\nIn all subsequent sections, the figures including model changes will form the basis for the movement analyses of our risk profile in 2023.

This is partially offset by the SCR reduction due to the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change.\n\nOverall, these model change result in a € 3.2 bn higher market risk of the Allianz Group at € 26.0 bn (2022: € 22.8 bn).\n\n### **Credit risk and operational risk**\n\nThe higher credit risk, and operational risk figures at Allianz Group level are mainly driven by the improved approach for allocating risk capital from major Group standard formula entities to the risk categories.\n\nThe minor model changes in 2023 do not have a material impact on credit risk and operational risk.\n\n### **Underwriting risk and business risk**\n\nFor underwriting risk and business risk, the higher figures at Allianz Group level are mainly resulting from the improved approach for the allocation of risks from standard formula entities.\n\nThe minor model changes in 2023 do not materially impact underwriting risk and business risk.\n\n### **Diversification benefits and tax relief**\n\nThe higher diversification benefits and tax relief figures are due to the explicit reflection of diversification benefits and the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes from the standard formula entities.\n\n### **Capital add-on**\n\nThe reduction in the capital add-on is mainly due to a decrease in the replicating portfolio add-on due to the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change.\n\n### **Minor non-EEA insurance entities**\n\nDue to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter 2023, the book value deduction approach will no longer be used for certain minor non-EEA insurance entities. Instead, a value for the contribution of solvency capital requirements from these entities to the Group is derived from an approach based on experience values from the standard formula calculations for the Allianz Group, which has been aligned with the regulator.\n\n### **Impact of model changes on Eligible Group Own Funds**\n\nAs a result of regulatory and model changes, we registered a € 7.3 bn increase of Own Funds after tax in 2023, mainly driven by the change for the minor non-EEA insurance entities that were formerly included via book-value-deduction in the amount of € 6.3 bn.\n\nThe remaining impacts of central, minor and immaterial model changes are mainly driven by Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG.\n\n### **Impacts of transitional measures**\n\nThe continued application of transitional measures on technical provisions for Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG resulted in an increase in the Own Funds of € 10.2 bn at the Group level.\n\n# Allianz risk profile and management assessment[1](#page-143-0)\n\nAllianz's core business as a global insurer and asset manager predominantly exposes it to a variety of risks such as underwriting risks, financial market and credit risks, and several other non-financial risks (i.e., operational, reputational, liquidity, and strategic risks). The execution of the strategic objectives may impact the potential severity or likelihood of these existing risks, contribute towards concentrations of certain types of risk, or potentially even give rise to new risks within a given risk category. However, from a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of Allianz has remained and is expected to remain stable. \"Stable\" in this context means a relatively high exposure to financial risks (i.e., the sum of financial market and credit risks), a moderate exposure to underwriting risks, and a modest exposure to operational, business, and other risks (i.e., measured as a share of the Allianz Group's Solvency II risk capital). Please refer to section \"Solvency II Regulatory Capitalization\" for further details.\n\n<span id=\"page-143-0\"></span>To support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, the Allianz Group has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- − Financial risks: The Allianz Group's ultimate objective is to assure that financial risk taking is in line with risk-bearing capacity at the Group and legal entity level, and that it creates shareholder equity. To manage financial risk effectively and avoid accumulated losses in times of financial crisis, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks inherent in the investment portfolios and in insurance products, including the development of new products.\n- − Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are required to serve customers and generate shareholder value. Quality control mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to Allianz's underwriting standards and monitor the quality of the portfolio and underwriting process. The underwriting processes must support sustainable and profitable business, secure consistency, align with the risk appetite of the Group and of the operating entities as well as avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations.\n- − Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to the core business and need to be carefully managed via continuous improvements in risk identification, risk assessment, and control environments. This occurs through elements of the Group Risk management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), Reputational Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\nAllianz faces a challenging financial market and operating environment. Markets are characterized by the risk of persistently high volatility. Interest rates have further increased, reflecting continued monetary policy tightening by key central banks to counter current inflation rates and long-term inflation expectations being above central banks' long-term inflation targets. Bonds and equity markets are fragile, as inflation and economic growth prospects for Europe and the United States are still impacted by repercussions from the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nand there is the risk of further global political and economic destabilization.\n\nLasting geopolitical and new regional political crises dominate the political and economic agenda. There is no clear resolution on the horizon for the lasting war in Ukraine. In addition, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza risks escalating into a regional military conflict with the involvement of Iran and the U.S., encompassing new risks for energy prices and inflation. Furthermore, there is the risk of a deterioration in the United States-China relationship, as well as of a further hardening of China's attitudes towards Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the geopolitical crises, there are several other factors that may lead to a persistent high financial market volatility. Lasting momentum for populist and radical parties in the Americas, in Europe, and around the globe could make international cooperation and coordination more challenging and complex, leading to a lower chance of impactful political action on geopolitical and regional crises, as well as on issues such as climate change, due to conflicting objectives. The risk factors also include further disruptions to global supply chains, which weigh on global trade, with the potential to prompt long-term structural shifts in these chains. Lasting risk factors include the challenges of implementing long-term structural reforms in key eurozone countries.\n\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies, combined with the rising use of artificial intelligence, increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyberattacks, data breaches, system failures, negative impacts from the use of deepfake tools on political and business processes, as well as the risk of non-compliance with increasing regulation covering IT-related business processes.\n\nTherefore, we continue to closely monitor political, financial and technological developments as well as the global trade situation to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.\n\nOur approved partial internal model has been applied since the beginning of 2016 when Solvency II came into effect. There is some uncertainty whether the provisional equivalence of the U.S. solvency regime for Solvency II purposes will be extended beyond 2025, as well as about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential introduction of future global capital requirements and from the current Solvency II review.\n\nThe Solvency II concept of \"equivalence\" allows third country solvency regimes to be recognized and used for Solvency II purposes. Most relevant for Allianz today, it allows the integration of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America into the Group capital calculation based on U.S. solvency requirements. The current provisional equivalent treatment of the U.S. expires at the end of 2025 and there is some risk that the equivalence will not be extended beyond 2025, with a potential negative impact on the solvency ratio of the Allianz Group.\n\nThe framework for potential future capital requirements for Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) is yet to be finalized by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nIn addition, in recent years, the European Commission reviewed the Solvency II directive as foreseen in European legislation. The review has been politically agreed by the trilogue parties (European Commission, European Parliament, and European Council) in December 2023, and the final text of the directive is expected to be published in the official journal of the European Union in the second or the third quarter of 2024. The corresponding update of Level 2 legislation (Solvency II regulation) as well as EIOPA guidelines will be performed by the European Commission and EIOPA during 2024 and 2025 and will cover outstanding technical details as delegated by the directive. The application of the new rules will start 24 months after their publication in the official journal of the European Union, i.e., for the second quarter of 2026 at the earliest.\n\nFinally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements based on a parallel application of a global capital framework (Insurance Capital Standard – ICS) as well as Solvency II could increase operational complexity and costs.\n\nThe management feels comfortable with the Group's overall risk profile and capitalization level. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- − Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well capitalized and has met its internal, rating agency, and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2023. Allianz remains one of the most highly rated insurance groups in the world, as reflected by our external ratings.\n- − The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Asset Management business segments, leading to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n- − Allianz is well-positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events such as those related to the ongoing war in Ukraine – due to our strong internal limit framework, stress testing, internal model, and risk management practices.\n- − Furthermore, the Group has the additional advantage of being well-diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of businesses and products.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, we expect to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement. However, Allianz is carefully monitoring the development of the war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions and regional political crises in particular, and manages its portfolios to ensure that the Group, Allianz SE, and the other Group companies have sufficient resources to meet their solvency capital needs.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Own Funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach, which is consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II[1](#page-145-0). Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization1**\n\n| As of 31 December    |      | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Own Funds            | € bn | 89.6 | 77.9 |\n| Capital requirement  | € bn | 43.5 | 38.8 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    | 206  | 201  |\n\n1\\_Excluding the application of transitional measures on technical provisions.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Allianz had been granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions for the two entities Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG. As of 31 December 2023 and including the application of transitional measures on technical provisions, the Own Funds and SCR amounted to € 99.7 bn and € 43.5 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 229 %. Our general capital steering, however, continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the application of transitional measures on technical provisions. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude transitional measures unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe following table summarizes our Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratios disclosed over the course of the year 2023:\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratios**\n\n| %                    | 31 Dec 2023 | 30 Sept 2023 | 30 Jun 2023 | 31 Mar 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |\n|----------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Capitalization ratio | 206         | 212          | 208         | 206         | 201         |\n\nCompared to year-end 2022, our Solvency II capitalization ratio increased by 5 percentage points to 206 % (2022: 201 %) since the increase in the Solvency II Capital Requirement was overcompensated by significantly higher Own Funds.\n\nThe development of the Solvency II ratio was positively supported by a solid operating Solvency II capital generation and business evolution (27 percentage points pre-tax) and a favorable impact of regulatory and model changes (4 percentage points), the latter primarily resulting from the dynamic inflation extrapolation model change and other central and local model changes.\n\nThis was partially compensated by negative effects. The main impact came from (capital) management actions ((16) percentage points), dominated by dividend accruals and share buy backs. Taxes also contributed to the decrease of the capitalization ratio ((8) percentage points). A small negative contribution ((1) percentage point) resulted from the net impact of capital market developments, whereby strain, especially from lower real estate valuations and interest rates, was largely offset by positive impacts, e.g., from stronger equity markets and lower inflation.\n\nThe following table presents the sensitivities of our Solvency II capitalization ratio under certain standard financial market scenarios.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratio sensitivities**\n\n| %                                                                                                            |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                                            | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Base capitalization ratio                                                                                    | 206  | 201  |\n| Interest rates up by 0.5%1                                                                                   | 208  | 202  |\n| Interest rates down by 0.5%1                                                                                 | 201  | 198  |\n| Equity prices up by 30%                                                                                      | 217  | 211  |\n| Equity prices down by 30%                                                                                    | 191  | 188  |\n| Combined scenario:<br>Equity prices down by 30%<br>Interest rate down by 0.5% 1<br>Credit spreads up by 0.5% | 179  | 179  |\n\n1\\_Non-parallel interest rate shifts due to extrapolation of the yield curve beyond the last liquid point in line with Solvency II rules.\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>The presented sensitivity analyses are based on defined variations of specific parameters and describe the resulting development of our Solvency II capitalization under such idealized scenarios (e.g., decrease in interest rates by 50 basis points). The observed developments will, however, typically materialize in a more complex way (e.g., interest rates are typically not decreasing in a parallel shift manner along the term structure). Therefore, sensitivities are to be interpreted in a way such that they provide valuable information on areas to which our capitalization is particularly sensitive together with an indication of the estimated magnitude. The actual observed developments in the capitalization can, however, be more or less pronounced depending on the specific realized circumstances. Our comprehensive stress testing framework is regularly analyzed in order to identify potential enhancements to support the explanatory power of stress tests conducted in light of our risk profile.\n\nThe Allianz Group is a financial conglomerate within the scope of the Financial Conglomerate Directive (FCD). The FCD does not impose a materially different capital requirement on the Allianz Group compared to Solvency II.\n\n# Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk category[2](#page-145-0)\n\nThis Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group's risk figures, reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and Group diversification effects.\n\nWe measure and steer risk based on an approved internal model which quantifies the potential adverse developments of Own Funds. The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed over different risk categories and determine the regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II.\n\nThe pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effect within each modeled risk category (i.e., market, credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification effects across risk categories. Group diversified risk figures also capture the diversification effect across all risk categories.\n\nThe Group diversified risk is broken down as follows:\n\n1\\_Own Funds and capital requirement are calculated under consideration of volatility adjustment and yield \n2\\_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to curve extension, as described in section \"Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment\".\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **C \\_ Group Management Report**\n\n**Allianz Group: Allocated risk according to the risk profile (total portfolio before non-controlling interests)**\n\n| € mn                                                                            |             |        |             |       |                   |        |               |       |                  |                          |                 |          |         |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------------------|--------|---------------|-------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|--------|\n|                                                                                 | Market risk |        | Credit risk |       | Underwriting risk |        | Business risk |       | Operational risk |                          | Diversification |          | Total   |        |\n| As of 31 December                                                               | 2023        | 20221  | 2023        | 20221 | 2023              | 20221  | 2023          | 20221 | 2023             | 20221                    | 2023            | 20221    | 2023    | 20221  |\n| Property-Casualty                                                               | 6,205       | 7,064  | 2,748       | 2,695 | 14,693            | 13,344 | 722           | 593   | 1,957            | 1,872                    | (10,039)        | (9,167)  | 16,285  | 16,401 |\n| Life/Health                                                                     | 17,591      | 17,064 | 1,657       | 1,531 | 2,280             | 1,647  | 5,729         | 5,490 | 1,854            | 1,645                    | (8,858)         | (8,830)  | 20,254  | 18,548 |\n| Corporate and Other                                                             | 2,053       | 1,853  | 286         | 286   | 33                | 73     | -

This was partially compensated by risk capital relief from effects such as model and assumptions updates at Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and various other companies of the Group.\n\nThe following sections explain the evolution of our risk profile per modeled risk category. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.\n\nThe following table presents our group-wide risk figures related to market risks by business segment and source of risk.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Risk profile – market risk by business segment and source of risk (total portfolio before tax and non-controlling interests)** pre-diversified, € mn\n\n|                                           | Interest rate |       | Inflation |       | Credit spread |       | Equity |        | Real estate |       | Currency |       | Total  |        |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                         | 2023          | 20221 | 2023      | 20221 | 2023          | 20221 | 2023   | 20221  | 2023        | 20221 | 2023     | 20221 | 2023   | 20221  |\n| Property-Casualty                         | (244)         | 328   | (1,171)   | (407) | 2,429         | 2,451 | 2,908  | 2,891  | 1,741       | 1,585 | 541      | 216   | 6,205  | 7,005  |\n| Life/Health                               | (27)          | 3,434 | (237)     | (58)  | 4,262         | 4,242 | 11,278 | 7,264  | 1,719       | 1,813 | 596      | 369   | 17,591 | 17,064 |\n| Corporate and Other                       | 77            | (181) | (103)     | (7)   | 216           | 310   | 1,773  | 1,517  | 166         | 168   | (76)     | 46    | 2,053  | 1,853  |\n| Total Group                               | (194)         | 3,581 | (1,511)   | (472) | 6,908         | 7,004 | 15,959 | 11,672 | 3,626       | 3,566 | 1,061    | 631   | 25,849 | 25,982 |\n| Share of total Group pre-diversified risk |               |       |           |       |               |       |        |        |             |       |          |       | 37.8 % | 39.7 % |\n\n1\\_2022 risk profile figures adjusted based on the impact of 2023 model changes.\n\nIn 2023, the Allianz Group's total pre-diversified market risk barely changed, as a strong increase in equity risk was offset by a decrease in interest rate risk and a higher risk relief from inflation risk.\n\nThe rise in the contribution of equity risk to market risk, especially in the Life/Health business segment, primarily resulted from stronger equity markets, together with a higher exposure to alternative equity investments and diversification effects within market risk. A decrease in interest rates, together with a lower duration gap, caused a shift in the contribution of interest rate risk and inflation risk to market risk.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our interest-rate-sensitive investments excluding unit-linked business – amounting to a market value of € 360.7 bn (2022: € 347.1 bn)[1](#page-147-0) – would have gained € 32.4 bn (2022: € 32.1 bn) or lost € 27.7 bn (2022: € 27.7 bn)[2](#page-147-1) in value in the event of interest rates shifting by -100 and +100 basis points, respectively. However, these impacts would have been partially offset by policyholder participation. In addition, the Solvency II Own Funds effect is much more limited due to our active duration management, reducing the duration mismatch of the Group to 0.2 years (from 0.6 years in 2022), representing Solvency II liabilities of shorter duration than assets.\n\nThe impact of a 0.5 % increase in interest rates on the Solvency II ratio is shown in the table \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratio sensitivities\" in the section \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization\".\n\n### **Equity risk**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our investments excluding unit-linked business that are sensitive to changing equity markets – amounting to a market value of € 77.4 bn[3](#page-147-0) (2022: € 73.6 bn) – would have lost € 19.7 bn[4](#page-147-1) (2022: € 18.4 bn) in value assuming equity markets had declined by 30 %. However, this impact would have been partially offset by policyholder participation.\n\nThe following table presents our group-wide risk figures for credit risks by business segment.\n\n#### **Allianz Group: Risk profile – allocated credit risk by business segment (total portfolio before tax and non-controlling interests)** pre-diversified\n\n|                                              |      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                            |      |       |       |\n| Property-Casualty                            | € mn | 2,748 | 2,695 |\n| Life/Health                                  | € mn | 1,657 | 1,531 |\n| Corporate and Other                          | € mn | 286   | 286   |\n| Total Group                                  | € mn | 4,691 | 4,513 |\n| Share of total Group pre-diversified<br>risk | %    | 6.86  | 6.89  |\n\nThroughout 2023, the Allianz credit portfolio was not affected by significant movements or events with respect to credit migration risk and default risk.\n\nUltimately, the overall credit risk for the Allianz Group increased by € 0.2 bn to € 4.7 bn (2022: € 4.5 bn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the maximum exposure to credit risk[5](#page-147-0) from debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to € 583.8 bn (2022: € 594.1 bn), the theoretical maximum exposure to credit risk from credit insurance <span id=\"page-147-2\"></span><span id=\"page-147-1\"></span><span id=\"page-147-0\"></span>amounted to € 1,185.7 bn (2022: € 1,102.0 bn), and the maximum exposure to credit risk from reinsurance amounted to € 28.1 bn (2022: € 28.8 bn).\n\n### **Credit risk – investments**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the credit risk arising from our investment portfolio accounted for 64.8 % (2022: 64.2 %) of our total Group prediversified internal credit risk[6](#page-147-2) .\n\nCredit risk in the Life/Health business segment is primarily driven by long-term assets covering long-term policyholder liabilities. Typical investments are government bonds, senior corporate bonds, covered bonds, self-originated mortgages and loans, and a modest number of derivatives. In the Property-Casualty business segment, fixed-income securities tend to be short- to mid-term, due to the nature of the business, and are not subject to policyholder participation.\n\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives is low, since derivatives usage is governed by the group-wide internal guideline for collateralization of derivatives, which stipulates master netting and collateral agreements with each counterparty and requires highquality and liquid collateral. In addition, Allianz closely monitors counterparties' credit ratings and exposure movements.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the rating distribution of our fixedincome portfolio based on issue (instrument) ratings was as follows:\n\n1\\_The stated market value includes all assets from internal model entities whose market value is sensitive to interest rate movements (excluding unit-linked business) reflecting the Solvency II framework, and therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles.\n\n2\\_The effects do not consider policyholder participation.\n\n3\\_The stated market value includes all assets from internal model entities whose market value is sensitive to equity movements (excluding unit-linked business) reflecting the Solvency II framework, and therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles.\n\n4\\_The effect does not consider policyholder participation.\n\n- 5\\_The stated investment exposure figures reflect gross carrying amounts. They are based on IFRS requirements and include investments that are not within the scope of the Solvency II framework.\n- 6\\_Additionally, 10.8 % (2022: 11.7 %) of our total Group pre-diversified internal credit risk is allocated to receivables, potential future exposure for derivatives and reinsurance, and other off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Rating distribution of Allianz Group's fixed-income portfolio1**\n\nBook values, € bn\n\n| Type of issuer    | Government bonds |       | Covered bonds |      | Corporate bonds |       | Banks |      | ABS/MBS |      | Short-term investments |      | Total |       |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------|---------------|------|-----------------|-------|-------|------|---------|------|------------------------|------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December | 2023             | 2022  | 2023          | 2022 | 2023            | 2022  | 2023  | 2022 | 2023    | 2022 | 2023                   | 2022 | 2023  | 2022  |\n| AAA               | 30.3             | 38.6  | 34.5          | 33.9 | 5.3             | 4.6   | 2.6   | 2.1  | 10.0    | 13.9 | -                      | -    | 82.7  | 93    |\n| AA                | 78.7             | 69.1  | 9.6           | 9.8  | 22.8            | 21.0  | 3.9   | 3.2  | 10.0    | 6.3  | 0.8                    | 0.9  | 125.8 | 110.4 |\n| A                 | 31.6             | 28.4  | 0.3           | 1.0  | 74.3            | 65.6  | 20.3  | 18.3 | 5.2     | 3.6  | 0.6                    | 0.8  | 132.4 | 117.7 |\n| BBB               | 37.7             | 35.0  | 0.1           | 0.3  | 99.7            | 101.5 | 6.0   | 7.5  | 2.2     | 1.9  | 0.3                    | 0.2  | 145.8 | 146.4 |\n| BB                | 7.2              | 6.7   | -             | -    | 9.1             | 11.5  | 0.4   | 0.4  | 0.2     | 0.1  | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 16.8  | 18.7  |\n| B                 | 1.6              | 2.9   | -             | -    | 3.2             | 2.5   | 0.1   | 0.1  | 0.1     | 0.1  | 0.2                    | 0.1  | 5.3   | 5.7   |\n| CCC               | 0.3              | 0.4   | -             | -    | 0.2             | 0.2   | 0.1   | -    | 0.1     | 0.1  | -                      | -    | 0.8   | 0.8   |\n| CC                | 0.2              | 0.2   | -             | -    | -               | -     | -     | -    | 0.1     | 0.1  | -                      | -    | 0.2   | 0.2   |\n| C                 | -                | -     | -             | -    | -               | -     | -     | -    | -       | -    | -                      | -    | 0.1   | 0.1   |\n| D                 | -                | -     | -             | -    | 0.1             | -     | -     | -    | -       | -    | -                      | -    | 0.2   | 0.1   |\n| Not rated         | 0.4              | 0.2   | -             | 0.1  | 8.4             | 5.8   | -     | 0.1  | 0.3     | 0.1  | 0.3                    | 0.1  | 9.4   | 6.4   |\n| Total             | 188.1            | 181.5 | 44.5          | 45.1 | 223.0           | 212.8 | 33.4  | 31.6 | 28.2    | 26.3 | 2.2                    | 2.2  | 519.4 | 499.5 |\n\n1\\_In accordance with the Group Management Report, figures stated include investments of Banking and Asset Management.

This is mainly due to changes in the interest rates environment. Materially lower EUR interest rates in particular led to a significant increase in longevity risk. In addition, local model calibration updates had an upward impact on mortality risk.\n\nContributions from the Property-Casualty and the Corporate and Other business segments are generated by the longevity risk of the internal pension schemes they contain.\n\nDue to effective product design and the diversity of our products, there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks within our Life/Health business segment.\n\nBusiness risk capital increased by 0.4 bn to € 6.5 bn (2022: € 6.1 bn). The main reason is the impact of the significantly lower EUR interest rates on the cost risk.\n\nOverall, the operational risk capital showed a slightly increased risk profile after the regular annual update of central and local parameters (increase by 0.4 bn from € 3.9 bn in 2022 to € 4.3 bn in 2023), mainly due to regulations and increasing cyber threats in some local markets.\n\nDetailed information regarding our liquidity risk exposure, liquidity, and funding – including changes in cash and cash equivalents – is provided i[n Liquidity and Funding Resources](#page-125-0) and i[n notes 7.3.1,](#page-215-0) [7.3.2](#page-215-1) and [7.5](#page-219-0) to the consolidated financial statements. As can be inferred from the section on the management of liquidity risks, while these are quantified and monitored through regular stress test reporting as well as properly managed, they are not quantified for risk capital purposes.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/1 description: The image features a large, light blue letter 'D' set against a dark blue background.

After the release of the Annual Report 2022, the Allianz Group continued with the preparation of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet and made some non-material adjustments. As such, the final version of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet for 2022 is slightly different from the preliminary version in the Annual Report 2022.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n#### **Consolidated income statement**\n\n€ mn\n\n|

These changes have also been reflected in comparative periods.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-0\"></span>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n# 1\\_ Natureof operationsand basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements present the operations of Allianz SE with its registered office in Königinstrasse 28, 80802 Munich, Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Allianz Group). Allianz SE is recorded in the Commercial Register of the municipal court in Munich under the number HRB 164232.\n\nThey have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted under European Union (E.U.) regulations in accordance with § 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). Within these consolidated financial statements, the Allianz Group has applied all standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and endorsed by the E.U. that are compulsory as of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn these consolidated financial statements, the Allianz Group has applied IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 for the first time. The related changes in significant accounting policies are described i[n note](#page-156-1) 2.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared as of and for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Allianz Group's presentation currency is the euro (€). Amounts are rounded to the nearest million (€ mn) unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Management on 22 February 2024.\n\nThe Allianz Group offers property-casualty insurance, life/health insurance, and asset management products and services in almost 70 countries.\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-1\"></span>2 \\_ Accounting policies, significant estimates, andnew accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following paragraphs describe important accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions relevant for the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions particularly influence the inclusion method as well as the accounting treatment of financial instruments and insurance contracts, goodwill, litigation provisions, pension liabilities and similar obligations, and deferred taxes. Significant estimates and assumptions are explained in the respective paragraphs.\n\n### **Reporting and presentation principles**\n\nThe Allianz Group's consolidated balance sheet is not presented using a current/non-current classification. The following balances are generally considered to be current: cash and cash equivalents, noncurrent assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale. The following balances are generally considered to be non-current: investments, deferred tax assets, intangible assets, and deferred tax liabilities.\n\nInsurance contracts are split by contracts issued (insurance) and held (reinsurance). Insurance contract portfolios in asset and liability position are further presented separately on the balance sheet. IFRS 17 is conceptually based on a prospective cash view, therefore all payables and receivables from insurance contracts as well as any deposits are part of the (re)insurance contract assets or liabilities.\n\nThe Allianz Group has made an accounting policy choice to apply the year-to-date approach for the accounting for insurance contracts. Therefore, the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements may change under IFRS 17 in subsequent interim financial statements and in the annual reporting period.\n\n### **Principles of consolidation**\n\n### **Scope of consolidation and consolidation procedures**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are generally entities where Allianz SE, directly or indirectly, owns more than half of the voting rights or similar rights with the ability to affect the returns of these entities for its own benefit.\n\nEntities where the Allianz Group does not hold a majority stake are included in the consolidated financial statements if the Allianz Group controls these entities based on either distinctive rights stipulated by shareholder agreements between the Allianz Group and the other shareholders in these companies or voting rights held by the Allianz Group which are sufficient to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.\n\nEntities where the Allianz Group holds a majority stake are not included in the consolidated financial statements if the Allianz Group does not control these entities because it has no majority representation in the governing bodies and/or it requires at least the confirmative vote of another investor to pass any decisions over relevant activities.\n\nFor certain entities, voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor of control, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and returns are directed by means of contractual arrangements, as is the case mainly for investment funds managed by Allianz Group internal asset managers. For investment funds managed by Allianz Group entities on the basis of contractual arrangements, the Allianz Group considers an exposure to variability from the aggregate economic interests (consisting of fees and direct interests in the investment funds) of more than 30% as indicative for control, unless there is evidence to the contrary, for example, if the \n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\ninvestment funds' financial and operating policies are largely predetermined or other parties engaged in the investment funds have substantive spin-off rights.\n\n### **Initial accounting for business combinations and measurement of non-controlling interests**\n\nWhere newly acquired subsidiaries are subject to business combination accounting, the provisions of IFRS 3 are applied. During the IFRS 3 measurement period, which is for a maximum of one year post the acquisition date, it may be necessary to adjust existing or recognize additional assets and liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holdersto a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation are generally measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n#### **Associates and joint arrangements**\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Allianz Group can exercise significant influence. In general, if the Allianz Group holds 20% or more of the voting power in an investee but does not control the investee, it is assumed to have significant influence.\n\nAlthough the Allianz Group's share in some entities is below 20%, the Allianz Group has significant influence over these entities if it is sufficiently represented in the governing bodies that decide on the relevant activities of these entities.\n\nFor certain third party managed investment funds in which the Allianz Group holds a stake of above 20%, the Allianz Group has no significant influence if it is not represented in the governing bodies of these investment funds or their investment activities are largely predetermined.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements have to be classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Allianz Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures in most cases.\n\nGenerally, investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, which may imply a time lag of up to three months. Income from investments in associates and joint arrangements – excluding distributions – is included in the interest − fair value through other comprehensive income, or result. Accounting policies of associates and joint arrangements are − fair value through profit or loss.\n\ngenerally adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Allianz Group.\n\nHowever, if investments in associates or joint ventures are held as the underlying items for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features, the Allianz Group elects the exemption from applying the equity method and measures these investments at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 instead. For the purposes of this election, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nFor further information, please refer t[o note 7.2.](#page-210-0) \n\n### **Foreign currency translation**\n\nForeign currency translation follows the guidance set forth in IAS 21. Income and expenses from subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the Allianz Group's presentation currency (euro) are translated to euro at the quarterly average exchange rate, unless the subsidiary's functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy, in which case the closing rate is applied in accordance with IAS 21.42.\n\nForeign currency gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reported in the valuation result in the consolidated income statement, unless they relate to the foreign exchange component of fair value changes that are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the latter case, the foreign exchange component is also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n### **Financial instruments**\n\n#### **Recognition and derecognition**\n\nFinancial assets are generally recognized and derecognized on the trade date, i.e., when the Allianz Group commits to purchase or sell securities.\n\n#### **Classification and measurement of financial assets**\n\nBased on the applicable business model and the respective contractual cash flow characteristics, the Allianz Group classifies a financial asset on initial recognition into one of the three measurement categories:\n\n- − amortized cost,\n- \n- \n\nAt the Allianz Group, financial assets that are backing insurance liabilities are generally considered to be held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (\"hold and sell\" business model).\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, investments in equity financial instruments are measured at fair value. The Allianz Group generally uses the irrevocable election at initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the instrument's fair value in other comprehensive income, provided that the instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies.\n\nMeasurement at fair value through profit or loss is only applied in exceptional cases, e.g., to reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise or if the above-mentioned preconditions for fair value through other comprehensive income measurement are not fulfilled.\n\n### **Classification and measurement of financial liabilities**\n\nIn general, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost, except for:\n\n- − Financial liabilities that are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, either because they are held for trading (including derivatives) or irrevocably designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition in accordance with IFRS 9.4.2.2.\n- − Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing involvement approach applies. These liabilities are measured in accordance with paragraphs 3.2.15 and 3.2.17 of IFRS 9.\n- − Financial guarantee contracts. Provided that the measurement rules in any of the first two points above do not apply, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognized less (where appropriate) the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.\n- − Contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies; such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Measurement at fair value**\n\nThe Allianz Group carries certain financial instruments at fair value and discloses the fair value of all financial instruments.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are measured and classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13, which categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.\n\nLevel 1 inputs of financial instruments traded in active markets are based on unadjusted quoted market prices or dealer price quotations for identical assets or liabilities on the last exchange trading day prior to or at the reporting date, if the latter is a trading day.\n\nLevel 2 applies if the market for a financial instrument is not active or when the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques based on observable input parameters.\n\nLevel 3 applies if not all input parameters that are significant to the entire measurement are observable in the market. Accordingly, the fair value is based on valuation techniques using non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques include the discounted cash flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which observable market prices exist, and other valuation models. Appropriate adjustments are made, for example, for credit risks.\n\nFor fair value measurements categorized as level 2 and level 3, the Allianz Group uses valuation techniques consistent with the three widely used valuation techniques listed in IFRS 13:\n\n- − Market approach: Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n- − Cost approach: Amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (current replacement cost).\n- − Income approach: Conversion of future amounts such as cash flows or income to a single current amount (present value technique).\n\nThere is no one-to-one connection between valuation technique and hierarchy level. Depending on whether valuation techniques are based on significant observable or unobservable inputs, financial instruments are classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nEstimates and assumptions of fair values and hierarchies are particularly significant when determining the fair value of financial instruments for which at least one significant input is not based on observable market data (classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The availability of market information is determined by the relative trading levels of identical or similar instruments in the market, with emphasis placed on information that represents actual market activity or binding quotations from brokers or dealers.\n\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments closely correlates with the use of non-market observable inputs. The Allianz Group uses a maximum of observable inputs and a minimum of non-market observable inputs when measuring fair value. Observability of input parameters is influenced by various factors such as type of the financial instrument, whether a market is established for the particular instrument, specific transaction characteristics, liquidity, and general market conditions. If the fair value cannot be measured reliably, amortized cost is used as a proxy for determining fair values.\n\nIn discharging its responsibilities in the area of the fair value measurement of illiquid investments (level 3), the Allianz Group has set up an independent Group Valuation Committee (GVC). The GVC is a cross-functional body which includes representation from the Allianz Group's accounting and reporting, risk, and, investment management functions as well as major operating entities. The GVC's objectives are the establishment and maintenance of appropriate market valuation standards as well as checks and balances in order to successfully manage the risks inherent in the internal and external fair valuation of illiquid investments. In this regard, the GVC initiates, approves, and maintains documented valuation best practices by illiquid asset cluster. Furthermore, the GVC is responsible for performing regular independent price verifications, onsite visits of operating entities, and for requiring the implementation of best practices in the area of the illiquid assets valuation. It also has prerogatives to implement measures to resolve any related findings and valuation disputes.\n\nFor further information with regards to the measurement at fair value, please refer t[o note](#page-219-0) 7.5.\n\n### **Impairments**\n\nThe Allianz Group's central risk framework under Solvency II serves as the basis for IFRS 9 impairment calculations. In regard of credit ratings which represent a central parameter of credit risk, the Allianz Group reuses the Solvency II assessment of the long-term creditworthiness of its debtors. In detail, the Solvency II rating assignment for the investment portfolio of the Allianz Group is based on external agency ratings enhanced by the Group's internal credit assessment. The internal credit assessment is used to add a point-in-time component to long-term ratings in order to capture current market information and to add forward-looking information. The Allianz Group uses hurdle ratings that indicate a significant increase in credit risk and consequently a transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 on a notch-by-notch basis. In addition, the rating hurdle is dependent on the expected maturity of the investment. A transfer to Stage 3 is triggered by a D rating or when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. The loss-given default assignment is performed based on the established methods applied for Solvency II purposes. The Allianz Group follows a cash-flow-based approach for the expected credit loss (ECL) calculation. In order to calculate the ECL, the Allianz Group uses transition matrices that take into account the probability of default (PD) as a quantitative measure of the credit quality of a financial instrument or counterparty assigned per rating notch as well as the transition probabilities quantifying the likelihood of rating changes over time.\n\n#### **Modifications of financial assets**\n\nIn some circumstances, the renegotiation or modification of the contractual cash flows of a financial asset can lead to the derecognition of the existing financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9. The Allianz Group accounting policies prescribe that a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial asset shall lead to the derecognition of the original financial asset and the recognition of a new financial asset. The determination whether the contractual terms have been modified substantially is based on a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment is required in case the qualitative assessment is not sufficient to establish that the terms of the modified financial asset are substantially different from those of the original financial asset. For the quantitative assessment, the Allianz Group applies the criteria for the extinguishment of financial liabilities analogically. Accordingly, a modification is deemed to be substantial if the net present value of the cash flows under the modified contractual terms, including any fees paid or received and discounted at the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the gross carrying amount of the financial asset prior to the modification.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Hedge accounting**\n\nThe Allianz Group has chosen as its accounting policy to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements, except for fair value hedges of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities, which continue to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.\n\nDerivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships are included in the line items investments measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Freestanding derivatives are included in the same line items.\n\nFor further information on derivatives, please refer t[o note](#page-217-0) 7.4.\n\n### **Insurance contracts**\n\n#### **Insurance and investment contracts**\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features are accounted for under the insurance accounting provisions of IFRS 17. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, please see section \"Investment contracts liabilities\".\n\nInsurance contracts are classified as direct participating contracts or contracts without direct participation features. The classification of insurance contracts forms the basis for the measurement model applied (see section \"Measurement\"). Direct participating contracts are contracts for which, at inception:\n\n- − the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- − the Allianz Group expects to pay the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n- − the Allianz Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nAs IFRS 17 does not provide any threshold for determining whether a share or proportion is substantial, this assessment requires judgment. Allianz has set up a group-wide process for assessing insurance contracts based on qualitative and quantitative criteria in order to appropriately reflect the individual contract specifics. For this assessment, the terms \"substantial share\" and \"substantial proportion\" have been applied by using 50% as rebuttable presumption.\n\n#### **Separation of components**\n\nIFRS 17 requires the separation of embedded derivatives, investment components, and performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services at inception of a contract, if certain conditions are met. The separated components need to be accounted for separately according to IFRS 9 (embedded derivatives, investment components) or IFRS 15 (non-insurance goods and services). The Allianz Group has not identified material performance obligations embedded in insurance contracts to provide non-insurance goods and services.\n\nThe Allianz Group applies IFRS 9 to determine whether there is an embedded derivative to be separated and, if so, how to account for that derivative, unless the derivative is itself a contract within the scope of IFRS 17. The majority of embedded derivatives identified in insurance contracts issued by the Allianz Group have been considered closely related or to include significant insurance risk, because there are usually strong interdependencies with other components of the contract such as contractual options, policyholder behavior, contractual surplus sharing, and mortality.\n\nIFRS 17 defines investment components as the amounts that an insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs. The Allianz Group identifies the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance. These include circumstances in which an insured event occurs or the contract matures or is terminated without an insured event occurring.\n\nAn investment component is classified as being distinct or nondistinct. The Allianz Group has not identified material distinct investment components.\n\nInvestment components that are non-distinct are not to be separated from the host insurance contract but are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. For most common life insurance products, the Allianz Group defines the cash surrender value as the non-distinct investment component. Generally, propertycasualty contracts do not have a surrender or maturity value and only have a benefit payment when a claim occurs. Therefore, a standard property-casualty contract without additional guaranteed payment features does not include any investment component. However, it is common with property-casualty contracts to have other explicit guaranteed payments, for example a low or no claim bonus or profit participation, which the Allianz Group defines as non-distinct investment components, if all respective criteria are met.\n\n### **Level of aggregation**\n\nMeasurement is not carried out at the level of individual contracts, but based on groups of contracts. To allocate individual insurance contracts to groups of contracts, the Allianz Group first defines portfolios which include contracts with similar risks that are managed together. These portfolios are subdivided into groups of contracts on the basis of profitability and annual cohorts. Both portfolios and groups of insurance contracts are always determined by the individual operating entities, considering their respective circumstances. The requirement to form annual cohorts that prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from being included in the same group (IFRS 17.22) is subject to an optional exemption in the E.U. endorsement of IFRS 17. The E.U. Commission grants E.U. users the right to choose whether or not to apply the requirement in IFRS 17.22 for certain contracts. The Allianz Group does not make use of this exemption.\n\nContracts in different currencies can fulfill the standard requirements of similar risks that are managed together. At the Allianz Group, there is one calculation currency per group of contract (GoC). In case of a GoC with contracts with different transaction currencies, a leading currency (GoC currency) is determined.\n\n#### **Measurement**\n\nIFRS 17 includes three measurement models. Insurance contracts\n\n- − with direct participation features are measured in line with the Variable Fee Approach (VFA);\n- − without direct participation features are measured under the General Measurement Model (GMM, also referred to as Building Block approach) applied; or\n- − without direct participation features can be measured under the PAA, if selected instead of GMM and eligibility criteria are fulfilled.\n\nThe Allianz Group generally applies the same accounting policies to reinsurance contracts held as to insurance contracts issued.\n\nThe Allianz Group applies the same accounting policies to the measurement of a group of reinsurance contracts held as to insurance contracts issued without direct participation features, with following adjustments:\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe estimates of the present value of future cash flows are measured using assumptions that are consistent with those used to measure the estimates of the present value of future cash flows for the underlying insurance contracts, with an adjustment for any risk of nonperformance by the reinsurer. The effect of the non-performance risk of the reinsurer is assessed at each reporting date and the effect of changes in the non-performance risk is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### **Liability for remaining coverage under the GMM/VFA**\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage (LRC) under the GMM consists of the fulfillment cash flows related to future services and the contractual service margin (CSM). The fulfillment cash flows represent the riskadjusted present value of Allianz's rights and obligations to the policyholders, comprising the building blocks of estimates of expected future cash flows, discounting, and an explicit risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk. The CSM represents the unearned profit from in-force contracts that an entity will recognize as it provides services over the coverage period. Each building block is measured separately, both on initial recognition and for subsequent measurement.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows comprise all cash flows expected to arise as the insurance contract is fulfilled. In estimating these future cash flows, the Allianz Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. Cash flows within the boundary of a contract relate directly to the fulfillment of the contract, including those for which the Allianz Group has discretion over the amount or timing. These include premiums from policyholders, payments to (or on behalf of) policyholders, insurance acquisition cash flows, and other costs incurred in fulfilling the contracts.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows arise from the activities of selling, underwriting and starting a group of contracts that are directly attributable to the portfolio of contracts to which the group belongs.\n\nDepending on the type of services provided, other costs that are incurred in fulfilling the contracts include:\n\n- − claims handling, maintenance and administration costs;\n- − recurring commissions payable on instalment premiums receivable within the contract boundary;\n- − costs that the Allianz Group will incur in providing investment services;\n- − costs that the Allianz Group will incur in performing investment activities to the extent that the Allianz Group performs them to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders by generating an investment return from which policyholders will benefit if an insured event occurs; and\n\n− income tax and other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholders under the terms of the contracts.\n\nAccording to IFRS 17, all future cash flows must be discounted. The IFRS 17 requirements for the interest curves used in the discounting are principle-based. An entity should use observable market data based on a risk-free base curve and portfolio-specific adjustments to reflect the illiquidity of insurance obligations in determining the interest curves. The Allianz Group applies a bottom-up approach in which the basic risk-free liquid yield curves are usually derived from swap rates or government yields for the specific currency and adjusted for remaining credit risk. These risk-free liquid yield curves are then adjusted to reflect illiquidity of the underlying insurance liabilities based on reference portfolios. In case of participating business, the reference portfolio reflects own assets and it is a currency-specific portfolio for non-participating business.\n\nThe table below sets out the continuously compounded rates used to discount the cash flows of insurance contracts for major currencies:\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Discount rates**\n\nin %\n\n|

Such non-financial risks include insurance risks, lapse and expense risk. IFRS 17 does not prescribe a specific approach for determining the risk adjustment. Allianz applies a Cost of Capital approach with a Cost of Capital rate of currently 6% as under Solvency II. The main differences in disclosure are that IFRS 17 requires a separate presentation of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for gross and ceded business, and a split for LRC and LIC. The main valuation differences are the reflection of diversification across Group subsidiaries in the risk adjustment of individual entities which is not allowed in the Solvency II risk margin, the exclusion of operational risk in the risk adjustment, differences in discounting, and the smoothing of risk inputs to address cross effects with financial risks not in scope of the risk adjustment.\n\nThe risk adjustment for LRC for life/health corresponds to a confidence level of 72% to 77% and is calculated based on distribution assumptions consistent to Solvency II (where applicable). For life/health, an ultimate distribution is estimated based on the Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital methodology for calculation of the risk adjustment for the LRC, projected to ultimate horizon per entity and aggregated to diversified group level. The confidence level is derived as the quantile of the Group net of reinsurance risk adjustment in the ultimate distribution of the Group.\n\nAt initial recognition, the CSM is measured to result in no income or expenses arising from the fulfillment cash flows, any cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date, and the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows and any other asset. If the fulfillment cash flows lead to a negative CSM at inception, it will be set to zero and the negative amount will be recorded immediately in the statement of profit or loss. At subsequent measurement, the CSM gets adjusted for changes in cash flows related to future services and for the interest accretion at interest rates locked-in at initial recognition of the group of contracts. A release from the CSM is recognized in profit or loss each period to reflect the services provided in that period based on \"coverage units\". IFRS 17 only provides principle-based guidance on how to determine these coverage units. Generally, the Allianz Group has defined the account value for the reflection of investment services and the sum at risk for insurance services as the default approach to determine these coverage units. If multiple services are provided in one contract, a weighting is applied, which is determined by the respective operational entity based on the respective features of the contract.\n\nThe VFA is a mandatory modification of the GMM regarding the treatment of the CSM to accommodate direct participating contracts. The assessment of whether an insurance contract meets the VFA eligibility criteria is made at the contract's inception and not revised later, except in case of a substantial modification of the contract. For contracts with direct participation features, the CSM is adjusted for changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items. No explicit interest accretion is required since the CSM is effectively remeasured when it is adjusted for changes in financial risks.\n\nAn additional CSM release is considered to avoid a delayed profit recognition by systematic real-world returns of direct participating business measured with the VFA. This adjustment reflects the expected real-world returns in relation to the risk-neutral returns applied in IFRS 17 measurement for a more appropriate allocation of the services provided in the current period, i.e., the relating income in the P&L is based on real-world assumptions. The adjustment is applied by the life/health entities in Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Expected real-world returns are updated once a year based on a fundamental analysis of long-term expectations.\n\nIf certain criteria are met, an entity may apply the so-called risk mitigation option when it uses a derivative, a non-derivative financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss, or a reinsurance contract held to mitigate financial risk. The entity may then choose to exclude from the CSM some or all of the changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risk on the amount of the entity's share of the underlying items, if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on that amount using derivatives or reinsurance contracts held; and changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items, if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on those fulfillment cash flows using derivatives, non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contracts held. The \n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nAllianz Group applies the risk mitigation option only for a limited number of portfolios in the Life/Health segment.\n\n#### **LRC under the PAA**\n\nThe Allianz Group uses the PAA for measuring contracts with a coverage period of one year or less and for groups of contracts where it is reasonably expected that the measurement of the LRC does not differ materially from the one that would be produced by applying the GMM or the VFA. The PAA eligibility per group of contract is regularly assessed. This assessment takes into account qualitative and quantitative factors which are determined at the Group level. The qualitative factors include but are not limited to the volatility of financial variables, related embedded derivatives, and the average length of the coverage period. For the quantitative test, the Allianz Group provides detailed scenarios including interest rate shocks per selected currency. Overall, the PAA is applied for the vast majority of the Allianz Group's property-casualty business (gross and ceded).\n\nIf facts and circumstances (e.g., an expected combined ratio above 100%) indicate that a group of insurance contracts measured under the PAA is onerous on initial recognition or subsequently becomes onerous, the Allianz Group increases the carrying amount of the LRC to the amounts of the fulfillment cash flows determined under the GMM with the amount of such an increase recognized in insurance service expenses and a loss component is established for the amount of the loss recognized. Subsequently, the loss component is remeasured at each reporting date as the difference between the amounts of the fulfillment cash flows determined under the GMM relating to the future service and the carrying amount of the LRC without the loss component.\n\n#### **Insurance acquisition cash flow asset**\n\nAt the Allianz Group, insurance acquisition cash flows are not expensed as incurred, but deferred over the coverage period for all measurement models. IFRS 17 foresees two levels of deferral (precoverage DAC and in-coverage DAC, DAC = deferred acquisition costs). Firstly, when insurance acquisition cash flows are incurred before the group of contracts is recognized (pre-coverage), and secondly, when the contracts are recognized following IFRS 17.38 (c) and IFRS 17.B125, where the insurance acquisition cash flows are implicitly deferred over the coverage period of the contracts to which the insurance acquisition cash flows relate. Regarding the precoverage DAC, a four-step approach applies to ensure standard compliant measurement:\n\n- 1. Identify and allocate insurance acquisition cash flows that relate to expected contract renewals and recognize those insurance acquisition cash flows as an asset (pre-coverage DAC).\n- 2. As soon as the expected contract renewals turn into insurance contracts, the pre-coverage DAC has to be transferred into incoverage DAC and included in the contractual cash flows.\n- 3. Regular assumption review of pre-coverage DAC per reporting period.\n- 4. Perform an assessment regarding the recoverability of the precoverage DAC, if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment.\n\n#### **Liability for incurred claims (LIC)**\n\nThe LIC is measured at the fulfillment cash flows relating to incurred claims. It comprises the fulfillment cash flows related to past service at the reporting date. It is calculated at a level of aggregation, which is determined at the local level based on relevant factors, e.g., line of business, region, or distribution channel. The LIC consists of the present value of future cash flows relating to incurred claims and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, applying the same principles for the estimates of future cash flows, the discount rate and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that apply to the LRC.\n\nFor the insurance contracts measured under the PAA, the Allianz Group decided to discount the future cash flows relating to incurred claims, even if those cash flows are expected to be paid or received in one year or less from the date the claims are incurred.\n\n#### **Risk adjustment for non-financial risk under PAA**\n\nThe risk adjustment for LIC for property-casualty corresponds to a confidence level in the range of 65% to 70% and is calculated based on distribution assumptions consistent to Solvency II (please refer also to risk adjustment for non-financial risk at Liability for remaining coverage under the GMM/VFA).\n\nFor property-casualty, this is based on the ultimate distribution underlying the Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital methodology for the calculation of the risk adjustment for the LIC, aggregated and diversified at Group level. The confidence level is derived as the quantile of the Group net of reinsurance risk adjustment in the ultimate distribution of the Group.\n\n#### **Reserving process**\n\nIn the following, the term reserves is meant to include the present value of future cash flows, the risk adjustment and the CSM.\n\nFor the business segments Life/Health and Property-Casualty, the central oversight process around reserve estimates includes the setting of group-wide standards and guidelines, regular site visits, as well as regular quantitative and qualitative reserve monitoring.\n\nThe oversight and monitoring of the Allianz Group's reserves culminate in quarterly meetings of the Allianz Group Reserve Committee, which is the supervising body that governs all significant reserves. It particularly monitors key developments across the Allianz Group affecting the level of the best estimate reserves.\n\nLife/Health reserves are subject to estimates and assumptions, especially on the life expectancy and health of an insured individual (mortality, longevity, and morbidity risk), on portfolio persistency (surrender and premium increase), and on the development of interest rates and investment returns (including asset-liability mismatch risk). These assumptions also have an impact on the presentation of costs arising from the origination of insurance business (acquisition cash flows). To ensure consistency in the application of actuarial methods and assumptions in the Life/Health reserving process, the Allianz Group has designed a two-stage reserving process:\n\nStage one: Life/Health reserves are calculated by qualified local staff experienced in the subsidiaries' business. The process follows group-wide standards for applying consistent and reasonable assumptions. The appropriateness of the best-estimate reserves and their compliance with group-wide standards is confirmed by the local chief actuary and local reserve committee.\n\nStage two: The Allianz Group actuarial function regularly evaluates the local reserving processes as well as reserving results, including the appropriateness and consistency of the assumptions, monitors and approves the validation of the actuarial models, and analyzes the movements of the reserves. Any adjustments to the reserves and other insurance-related reporting items are reported to and analyzed together with the Allianz Group Reserve Committee.\n\nProperty-Casualty reserves are set by leveraging the use of actuarial techniques and educated judgment. These include the best estimate of the cash flows (e.g., claims, premiums, and expenses) and the discounting of the claims. A two-stage process exists for the setting of the P&C reserves in the Allianz Group:\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nStage one: Property-Casualty reserves are calculated by local reserving actuaries at the Allianz subsidiaries. The reserves are set at a best-estimate level based on a thorough analysis of historical data, enhanced by interactions with other business functions (e.g., Underwriting, Claims and Reinsurance). Actuarial judgment is applied where necessary, especially in cases where data is unreliable, scanty, or unavailable. The judgment of Property-Casualty actuaries is based on past experience of the characteristics of each line of business, the current stage of the underwriting cycle, and the external environment in which the subsidiary operates. The reserves are proposed to a local reserve committee, where the rationale of the selections is discussed and subsequently documented. The appropriateness of the bestestimate reserves and their compliance with group-wide standards is confirmed by the local chief actuary and local reserve committee.\n\nStage two: The Allianz Group Actuarial function forms an opinion on the best-estimate level of the reserves proposed by the local entities. The Allianz Group Actuarial function challenges the operating entities' selection through their continuous interaction with local teams and quarterly attendance in the local reserve committees. The ability to form a view on the reserve best-estimate level is further enabled by regular reviews of the local reserving practices. Such reviews consist of an evaluation of the reserving process as well as of the appropriateness of models, methods, and assumptions, and an analysis of the movements of the reserves. Significant findings from these reviews are communicated in the Allianz Group Reserve Committee to initiate actions where necessary. The Allianz Group Actuarial function monitors and assesses the documentation of the validation work performed by the Allianz subsidiaries.\n\n### **Distinction between financial and non-financial risk**\n\nIn general, the Allianz Group recognizes inflation as a financial risk for claims benefits and other insurance expenses (e.g., claims handling) only when inflation is contractually linked to an index. There are insurance products where the amounts to be paid are legally or contractually linked to an inflation-index such as a consumer price index.\n\n### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise balances with banks payable on demand, balances with central banks, cash on hand, and treasury bills to the extent they are not included in investments measured at fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore, this balance sheet item contains checks and bills of exchange that are eligible for refinancing at central banks, subject to a maximum term of three months from the date of acquisition as well as reverse purchase agreements that are due within three months.\n\n### **Investments**\n\n### **Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss**\n\nInvestments measured at fair value through profit or loss comprise debt instruments that are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss based on the underlying business model or cash flow characteristics as well as financial assets that are irrevocably designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Equity instruments are included in this line item if Allianz deviates from its general approach to designate them as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or if they do not fulfill the prerequisites for such a designation.\n\n### **Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nThese investments include debt financial assets that are held within a \"hold and sell\" business model and whose contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nIn addition, investments in equity instruments that are designated to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are presented in this line item. As prescribed by IFRS 9, amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. Instead, the Allianz Group accounting policies foresee that the cumulative amounts are transferred directly within equity upon derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n#### **Investments measured at amortized cost**\n\nInvestments measured at amortized cost relate to debt financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (\"hold to collect\" business model) and whose contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\n#### **Investments in associates and joint ventures**\n\nFor details on the accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures, please see the section \"Principles of consolidation\".\n\n#### **Real estate held for investment**\n\nReal estate held for investment is initially measured at cost, including directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nFor the subsequent measurement, the Allianz Group applies the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40.33 if the property is held as an underlying item for insurance contracts with direct participation features and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nIn all other cases, the Allianz Group applies the cost model pursuant to IAS 40.56 and carries real estate held for investment at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the property's useful life, with a maximum of 50 years. Furthermore, real estate held for investment is regularly tested for impairment.\n\n#### **Fixed assets from alternative investments**\n\nExcept for biological assets, these assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments in accordance with IAS 16.\n\nThey are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life, with a maximum of 35 years, and regularly tested for impairment.\n\nBiological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with changes therein recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Financial assets for unit-linked contracts**\n\nFinancial assets for unit-linked contracts are neither held within a \"hold to collect\" nor within a \"hold and sell\" business model. Consequently, they are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n### **(Re-)Insurance contract assets**\n\nThe balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (\"insurance contracts\") or held (\"reinsurance contracts\"). For details regarding main accounting policies and significant estimates please see separate section Insurance contracts.\n\n### **Other assets**\n\nOther assets primarily consist of leased or owned real estate held for own use, software and equipment, receivables, non-current assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, and assets for deferred compensation programs.\n\nThe Allianz Group has elected the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 as its accounting policy to measure properties held for own use that are underlying items of (a group of) insurance contracts with direct participation features. For the purpose of this election, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nAll other items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured based on the cost model pursuant to IAS 16.30. When applying the cost model, depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Software is generally amortized straight-line over its expected useful life. The right-of-use assets related to leased property and equipment are generally depreciated over the lease term.\n\nThe table below summarizes estimated useful lives for real estate held for own use, software, and equipment.\n\n### **Estimated useful lives (in years)**\n\n|                              | Years   |\n|------------------------------|---------|\n| Real estate held for own use | max. 50 |\n| Software                     | 3 - 13  |\n| Equipment                    | 2 - 10  |\n\n### **Intangible assets and goodwill**\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairments.\n\nThe table below summarizes estimated useful lives and the amortization methods for each material class of intangible assets with finite useful lives.\n\n#### **Estimated useful lives (in years) and amortization methods**\n\n|                                   | Useful lives | Amortization method                                     |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Long-term distribution agreements | 10 - 20      | straight-line considering<br>contractual terms          |\n| Customer relationships            | 4 - 40       | straight-line or in relation<br>to customer churn rates |\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations is recognized in the amount of the consideration transferred plus the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree held by the direct parent in excess of the fair values assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is generally carried in the acquiree's functional currency. An evaluation of whether the goodwill is deemed recoverable takes place at least once a year.\n\nFurther explanations on the impairment test for goodwill and its significant assumptions as well as respective sensitivity analyses are given i[n note](#page-231-0) 8.9.\n\n### **Financial liabilities**\n\n#### **Financial liabilities for puttable financial instruments**\n\nThe Allianz Group records financial liabilities where non-controlling shareholders have the right to put their ownership interests back to the Allianz Group (puttable instruments). If these non-controlling shareholders still have present access to the risks and rewards associated with the underlying ownership interests, the non-controlling interests remain recognized, and profit or loss is allocated between controlling and non-controlling interests. The financial liabilities for puttable instruments are generally required to be recorded at the redemption amount. The Allianz Group recognizes valuation changes in equity where the non-controlling shareholders have present access to risks and rewards of ownership. In all other cases, valuation changes are recognized in the income statement. As an exception, for puttable instruments that are classified as equity instruments in the separate or individual financial statements of the issuer in accordance with IAS 32.16A-16B and are to be presented as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group instead of noncontrolling interests, valuation changes of these liabilities are always recognized in the income statement. This is the case for puttable instruments issued by mutual funds controlled but not wholly owned by the Allianz Group.\n\n### **Certificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities**\n\nCertificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method to amortize the premium or discount to the redemption value over the life of the liability.\n\n### **(Re-)Insurance contract liabilities**\n\nThe balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (\"insurance contracts\") or held (\"reinsurance contracts\") . For details regarding main accounting policies and significant estimates please see separate section Insurance contracts.\n\n### **Investment contract liabilities**\n\nInvestment contract liabilities include financial liabilities of investment contracts without discretionary participation features accounted for under IFRS 9. The financial liabilities for those contracts are initially recognized at fair value, or the amount of the deposit by the contract holder, net of the transaction costs, that are directly attributable to the \n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nissuance of the contract. Subsequently, the non-unit-linked investment contracts are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, while the unit-linked contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n### **Other liabilities**\n\n### **Pensions and similar obligations**\n\nPensions and similar obligations are measured at present value and presented net of plan assets by applying the provisions of IAS 19. For a reliable estimate of the obligations owed to employees, the Allianz Group makes separate estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as discount rates, inflation rates, compensation increases, pension increases, and rates of medical cost trends) for each material pension plan, considering the circumstances in the individual countries.\n\nFurther explanations and sensitivity calculations are given in [note](#page-239-0) 8.16.\n\n#### **Share-based compensation plans**\n\nThe share-based compensation plans of the Allianz Group are classified as either equity-settled or cash-settled plans. Where equitysettled plans involve equity instruments of Allianz SE, a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity is recognized. Where equity-settled plans involve equity instruments of subsidiaries of the Allianz Group, the corresponding increase is recognized in non-controlling interests. Where expected tax deductions differ, in terms of amount and timing, from the cumulative share-based payment expense recognized in profit or loss, deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences.\n\n#### **Lease liabilities**\n\nThe Allianz Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Furthermore, the Allianz Group does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for car leases. The expenses relating to the shortterm leases and leases of low-value assets including car leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor further information on these expenses, please refer to note [8.15.](#page-239-1)\n\n### **Equity**\n\nIssued capital represents the mathematical per-share value received at the issuance of shares.\n\nAdditional paid-in capital represents the premium exceeding the issued capital received at the issuance of shares.\n\nUndated subordinated bonds comprise Restricted Tier 1 notes that qualify as equity instruments pursuant to IAS 32. The instruments are presented within shareholders' equity and any related interest charges are classified as distributions from shareholders' equity, without affecting profit or loss. The notes are measured at their historical value. In addition, notes denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro at the quarterly closing exchange rate. The corresponding foreign exchange differences are recognized as foreign currency translation adjustments in equity.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent equity in subsidiaries, not attributable directly or indirectly, to Allianz SE as parent.\n\nRetained earnings comprise the net income of the current year and of prior years not yet distributed, treasury shares, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income, and any amounts directly recognized in equity according to IFRS.\n\nPlease refer to the section \"Foreign currency translation\" above for an explanation of foreign currency changes that are recognized in equity. The effective portion of gains and losses of hedging instruments designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nOther unrealized gains and losses (net) include unrealized gains and losses from investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and from derivative financial instruments that either meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting or, in the case of a fair value hedging relationship, hedge equity financial instruments that are designated to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe unrealized gains and losses from insurance contacts (net) are the cumulative amounts between the total insurance finance income or expenses and the amount included in profit or loss.\n\n### **Insurance revenue**\n\n#### **Insurance revenue under the GMM/VFA**\n\nThe Allianz Group recognizes insurance revenue as it provides services under groups of insurance contracts. For contracts measured under the GMM or VFA, the insurance revenue relating to services provided for each reporting period represents the total of the changes in the LRC that relate to services for which the Allianz Group expects to receive consideration, and comprises the following items:\n\n- − A release of the CSM, measured based on coverage units provided.\n- − Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current services.\n- − Claims and other insurance service expenses incurred in the year, generally measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the year, excluding amounts allocated to a potential loss component, repayments of investment components, insurance acquisition expenses, and amounts that relate to transactionbased taxes collected on behalf of third parties.\n- − Other amounts, including experience adjustments for premium receipts for current or past services.\n\n#### **Insurance revenue under the PAA**\n\nIn applying the PAA, insurance revenue for the period is the amount of expected premium receipts (excluding any investment component and adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, if applicable) allocated to the period. As such, for contracts measured under the PAA at the Allianz Group, the expected premium receipts are allocated to insurance revenue based on the passage of time, unless the expected pattern of incurring the insurance service expenses differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case the latter should be used.\n\n### **Insurance service expenses**\n\nThese expenses consist of claims and other insurance service expenses incurred during the period as well as the amortization of insurance acquisition cash flows, but exclude repayments of investment components. Furthermore, they include the changes in the fulfillment cash flows relating to the LIC, the losses on onerous groups of contracts and reversals of such losses and the impairment loss on the assets for the pre-coverage acquisition cash flows and the reversals of such losses. For the insurance contracts with direct participation features, it also includes an adjustment for experience adjustments of the nonfinancial underlying items.\n\nInsurance service expenses include only costs that relate directly to the fulfillment of the insurance contracts. The Allianz Group furthermore distinguishes between direct costs and overhead costs.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Reinsurance result**\n\nThe Allianz Group applies the accounting policy option outlined in IFRS 17.86 to present income and expenses from a group of reinsurance contracts held, other than insurance finance income and expenses, as a single amount.\n\n### **Interest result**\n\nInterest result is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. This line item also includes dividends from equity securities, income from investments in associates and joint ventures measured using the equity method, as well as lease income. Dividends are recognized in income when the right to receive the dividend is established.\n\nLease income from operating leases (excluding receipts for services provided such as insurance and maintenance, which are recognized as income under fee and commission income) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the receipts are not on such a basis, for example upfront payments.\n\n### **Valuation result**\n\nValuation result contains all investment income and expenses as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for income and expenses that are recognized in interest result.\n\nIn addition, commissions attributable to trading operations and related interest expenses, as well as refinancing and transaction costs are included in this line item. Foreign currency gains and losses on monetary items are also reported within valuation result.\n\nFor further details on the composition of this line item, please refer t[o note 7.1.](#page-207-1) \n\n### **Net insurance finance expenses**\n\nNet insurance finance expenses consist of finance income or expenses from insurance contracts issued and the finance income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held including the effect of time value of money and the effect of financial risk. It includes the interest accretion of the fulfillment cash flows and the CSM as well as the changes in the fulfillment cash flows due to changes in financial assumptions. For groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features, changes in the value of underlying items excluding additions and withdrawals are included in net insurance finance expenses.\n\nGenerally, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the insurance finance income or expenses other than those arising from the risk mitigation option between profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) based on a systematic allocation. Furthermore, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the change in risk adjustment for non-financial risk between a change related to non-financial risk and the effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money, which are included in net insurance finance expenses.\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the GMM, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is determined using the discount rates by which estimated future cash flows have been discounted on initial recognition, i.e., the \"locked-in\" interest rate. For Life/Health entities, the Allianz Group applies a cash flow-weighted average of interest curves through the quarters. It means averaging each quarterly interest curve for each maturity over the cash flows with maturity over the quarters. For the indirect participating insurance contracts accounted for under the GMM, for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the future cash flows is determined by using the effective yield approach or expected crediting rate approach for contracts that use a crediting rate to determine amounts due to the policyholders. An expected crediting rate approach uses an allocation that is based on the amounts credited in the period and expected to be credited in future periods based on the crediting strategy of the operating entities and under the contractual features. For the finance income or expenses arising from the CSM, a systematic allocation is determined using the \"locked-in rate\".\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features accounted for under the VFA, the Allianz Group generally holds the underlying items. The insurance finance income or expense included in profit or loss is the amount that exactly matches the income or expenses included in profit or loss for the underlying items (i.e., the current period book yield of the underlying items), resulting in the net of the separately presented items being nil.\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the PAA, the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is determined using the discount rates at the date of the incurred claim, i.e., the \"locked-in\" interest rate based on accident year. For Property-Casualty entities, the Allianz approach is the simple average of interest curves through the quarters weighted by ¼ each.\n\n### **Net result from investment contracts**\n\nThe net result from investment contracts consists of changes to the investment contracts liabilities, benefits paid to the policyholders, acquisition costs, settlement costs and administrative expenses from unit-linked investment contracts and non-unit-linked investment contracts without discretionary participation features as well as investment income and expenses from unit-linked investment contracts.\n\n### **Fee and commission income**\n\nFee and commission income primarily consists of asset management fees which are recognized when the service is provided. For those fees, the service is considered to be provided periodically. Performance fees from funds are not usually recognized as income until the end of the funds' term. Before its completion, the payment claim depends on the occurrence of certain events, such as the future development of the fund, which is regularly not reliably estimable. Carried interest is generally recognized as revenue on the date of the formal declaration of distribution by the investee and only earlier if sufficient evidence exists to support that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of carried interest revenue will not occur. The transaction price for asset management services is determined by the fees contractually agreed.\n\n### **Income taxes**\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective local taxable income and local tax rules for the period. In addition, current income taxes presented for the period include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally assessed, excluding interest expenses and penalties on the underpayment of taxes. In the event that amounts included in the tax return are considered unlikely to be accepted by the tax authorities (uncertain tax positions), a provision for income taxes is recognized. The amount is based on the best possible assessment of the tax payment expected. Tax refund claims from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that they can be realized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated for temporary differences between the tax bases and the financial statement carrying amounts, including differences from consolidation, unused tax loss carry-forwards, and unused tax credits. The measurement of deferred tax assets has to take into account estimates on the availability of future taxable profits. This includes the character and amounts of taxable future profits, the periods in which those profits are expected to occur, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. \n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allianz Group recognizes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is unlikely that a corresponding amount of future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards, and tax credits can be utilized.\n\nFurther explanations are given in [note](#page-227-0) 8.4.\n\n### **First application of IFRS 9 and 17**\n\n#### **General information**\n\nThe Allianz Group has initially applied IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, including any consequential amendments to other standards, from 1 January 2023. These standards have brought significant changes to the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments.\n\nIFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4 and establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held, and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Detailed qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the effects from the initial application of IFRS 17 on the Allianz Group's financial statements have been included in note 2 of the Annual Report 2022. IFRS 17 has to be applied retrospectively unless this is impracticable. Fulfillment cash flows are determined prospectively at every reporting date, including the date of initial application. However, the contractual service margin is rolled forward over time, a split of profits between equity (\"earned profits\") and contractual service margin (\"unearned profits\") is required but is often judgmental. If a full retrospective application is impracticable, an entity can choose between a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach. This accounting policy choice for the transition approach was made on a group of contract level. The decision involved the consideration of multiple criteria, such as availability of reliable and objective information, operational complexity, or the reasonableness of the split between earned and unearned profits. For contracts measured under the variable fee approach, the Allianz Group has generally applied the modified retrospective approach using the fair value of the underlying items as the basis from which to determine the contractual service margin at transition. The most significant portion of insurance contracts measured under the fair value approach is the life business in the U.S.\n\nThe AllianzGroup applied modifications under the modified retrospective approach only to the extent that it did not have reasonable and supportable information available to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively.\n\nUnder the fair value approach, the contractual service margin of a group of contracts at transition is determined as the difference between the fair value of this group at transition determined in accordance with IFRS 13 and the corresponding IFRS 17 fulfillment cash flows measured at transition. Conceptually, the contractual service margin usually reflects the insurer's expected future profits from writing business (entry price concept). Under the fair value approach, however, the contractual service margin reflects the margin an average market participant would require taking over the contracts (exit price concept). Therefore, when determining the fair value of a group of contracts, the Allianz Group replaces entity-specific assumptions with objective assumptions that an average market participant would use for pricing the liability. For this, the AllianzGroup has determined the exit price either based on a real-world projection of the present value of future profits of the group of contracts or using an internal rate of return methodology based on distributable earnings. For most groups of contracts for which the internal rate of return methodology was applied, the AllianzGroup used an internal rate of return of 13%.\n\nBesides the determination of the contractual service margin, another crucial key topic at transition is the determination of historic interest rates. The Allianz Groupmakes use of the introduction of Solvency II, which is the general basis for the interest rates.\n\nIFRS 9, issued by the IASB in July 2014, fully replaces IAS 39 and provides a new approach on how to classify financial instruments based on their cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they are managed. Furthermore, the standard introduces a new forwardlooking impairment model for debt instruments and provides new rules for hedge accounting.\n\nGiven the strong interrelation between the measurement of direct participating insurance contracts and the underlying assets held, the AllianzGroup decided to use the option to defer the full implementation of IFRS 9 until annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 when IFRS 17 came into effect.\n\nUpon transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the Allianz Group has elected to restate the comparative information of financial assets for IFRS 9. This includes the application of the classification overlay to all financial assets derecognized in the comparative period. In connection with the classification overlay, the AllianzGroup also applies the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 to all financial assets in scope.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9**\n\n#### **Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9**\n\n| € mn

Due to differences in the nature of products, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into the business segments Property-Casualty and Life/Health. In accordance with the responsibilities of the Board of Management, each of the insurance business segments is grouped into the following reportable segments:\n\n- − German Speaking Countries and Central & Eastern Europe,\n- − Western & Southern Europe, Allianz Direct and Allianz Partners,\n- − Asia Pacific,\n- − USA (Life/Health only),\n- − Global Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East and Africa.\n\nBoth asset management as well as corporate and other activities represent separate reportable segments. In total, the Allianz Group has identified 11 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8.\n\nThe types of products and services from which the reportable segments derive revenues are described below.\n\n### **Property-Casualty**\n\nIn the business segment Property-Casualty, reportable segments offer a wide variety of insurance products to both private and corporate customers, including motor liability and own damage, accident, general liability, fire and property, legal expense, credit, and travel insurance.\n\n### **Life/Health**\n\nIn the business segment Life/Health, reportable segments offer a comprehensive range of life and health insurance products on both an individual and a group basis, including annuities, endowment and term insurance, unit-linked and investment-oriented products, as well as full private health, supplemental health, and long-term care insurance.\n\n### **Asset Management**\n\nThe reportable segment Asset Management operates as a global provider of institutional and retail asset management products and services to third-party investors. It also provides investment management services to the Allianz Group's insurance operations. The products for retail and institutional customers include equity and fixedincome funds as well as multi-assets and alternative products. The United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region represent the primary asset management markets.\n\n### **Corporate and Other**\n\nThe reportable segment Corporate and Other includes the management and support of the Allianz Group's businesses through its strategy, risk, corporate finance, treasury, financial reporting, controlling, communication, legal, human resources, technology, and other functions. Furthermore, it includes the banking activities in France, Italy, and Bulgaria, as well as digital investments.\n\nPrices for transactions between reportable segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Lease transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS, except for intra-group lease transactions which are classified as operating leases (i.e., off-balance sheet treatment by lessee) for internal and segment reporting purposes. Transactions between reportable segments are eliminated in the consolidation. Financial information is recorded based on reportable segments; cross-segmental countryspecific information is not determined.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses operating profit and shareholders' core net income to evaluate the performance of its reportable segments as well as of the Allianz Group as a whole.\n\nOperating profit highlights the portion of income before income taxes that is attributable to the ongoing core operations of the Allianz Group. The Allianz Group considers the presentation of operating profit to be useful and meaningful to investors because it enhances the understanding of the Allianz Group's underlying operating performance and the comparability of its operating performance over time.\n\nTo better understand the ongoing operations of the business, the Allianz Group generally excludes the following non-operating effects:\n\n- − realized gains/losses (net),\n- − expected credit loss allowance,\n- − income from derivatives (net),\n- − interest expenses from external debt,\n- − impairments of investments (net),\n- − valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss,\n- − specific acquisition and administrative expenses, consisting of acquisition-related expenses (from business combinations), income taxes related incidental benefits/expenses, litigation expenses, and one-time effects from significant reinsurance transactions with disposal character,\n- − amortization of intangible assets,\n- − restructuring and integration expenses, and\n- − income and expenses from the application of hyperinflation accounting.\n\nThe following exceptions apply to this general rule:\n\n- − In all reportable segments, the valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss is treated as operating profit if it relates to operating business.\n- − For life/health insurance business and property-casualty insurance products with policyholder participation, all items listed above are included in operating profit if the profit sources are shared with policyholders.\n\nShareholders' core net income presents the shareholders' portion of income before market movements and amortization of specific intangible assets from business combinations (including any related tax effects). The Allianz Group considers the presentation of shareholders' core net income to be useful and meaningful because it reduces the volatility and impact caused by non-operating items which are not attendant to the Allianz Group's sustainable performance.\n\nWhen determining shareholders' core net income, the Allianz Group generally excludes the following non-operating items (including any related tax effects):\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n- − Non-operating market movements:\n\t- − valuation result from investments and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and\n\t- − income from derivatives.\n- − Non-operating amortization and impairments of intangible assets from business combinations except for insurance, investment or service contracts or agreements for the distribution of such contracts.\n\nOperating profit and shareholders' core net income should be viewed as complementary to, and not as a substitute for, income before income taxes or net income as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the responsibilities of the Board of Management. The insurance activities in Iberia & Latin America have been included in the reportable segment Global Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East and Africa. Greece was moved into the reportable segment Western & Southern Europe, Allianz Direct and Allianz Partners. Previously reported information has been adjusted to reflect this change in the composition of the Allianz Group's reportable segments.\n\nAdditionally, some minor reallocations between the reportable segments have been made.\n\n#### **Business segment information – consolidated balance sheet**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                            | Property-Casualty |         | Life/Health |

commission income in Property-Casualty, statutory gross premiums in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management. The definition of total business volume is comparable to the definition of total revenues previously used within the Allianz Group. The revenues from the banking business are, however, not part of the total business volume anymore as the remaining banking activities can be considered immaterial. Moreover, in Property-Casualty and in Life/Health, smaller adjustments to premiums at some entities are applied, following some interpretation/presentation changes.\n\n2\\_Total revenues comprise insurance revenue and fee and commission income in Property-Casualty, insurance revenue in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management.\n\n3\\_Includes acquisition and administrative expenses, other income, and other expenses.\n\n4\\_Includes, if applicable, acquisition-related expenses, income taxes related incidental benefits/expenses, litigation expenses, one-time effects from significant reinsurance transactions with disposal character, and income and expenses from the application of hyperinflation accounting. Until 2022, the effects from the application of hyperinflation accounting were included in non-operating investment income (net).\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Business segment information – reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes to shareholders' core net income (loss)**\n\n€ mn\n\nFor steering purposes, the Allianz Group classifies certain income and expenses differently than required by IFRS as this is considered to provide more meaningful information. The main line items affected are the operating insurance service result, the operating net result from investment contracts, and the operating net investment income.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses operating insurance service result as a performance indicator. In contrast to the IFRS 17 definition of insurance service result, the following components not included in the IFRS insurance service result are included in the operating insurance service result:\n\n- − non-attributable acquisition, administrative, and claims expenses which before adoption of IFRS 17 were also included in the underwriting result. These expenses are included in the line acquisition and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement[1](#page-175-0) ;\n- − adjustments for experience variances at claims and expenses if the technical result is shared with the policyholders. In the consolidated income statement, these experience variances are part of the net insurance finance expenses;\n- − specific restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets which are shared with the policyholders.\n\n<span id=\"page-175-0\"></span>For a better analysis of the result from investment contracts, all related income and expenses are included in the line operating result from investment contracts. For this, fee and commission income and expenses as well as net investment income are reclassified from the respective line items in the Group income statement.\n\nFee and commission income and expenses are reclassified to operating net investment income if they are related to insurance contracts.\n\nThe following table reconciles the amounts in the consolidated Group income statement to the amounts presented in the reconciliation of operating profit (loss) to net income (loss) (OP reconciliation).\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_For the following reconciliation, non-attributable acquisition, administrative, and claims expenses and restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets are included in the line Other result.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **D \\_ Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n#### **Reconciliation for special line items between Group income statement and reconciliation of operating profit to net income**\n\n€ mn\n\n| Consolidated income statement<br>line items                        | Consolidated income<br>statement |          | Reclassification of non-<br>attributable expenses |         | Reclassification of<br>variances and<br>restructuring expenses |       | Reclassification of income<br>related to investment<br>contracts |       | Reclassification of fee<br>income related to<br>insurance contracts |         | OP reconciliation |                                                 | OP reconciliation line items                              |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--|\n|                                                                    | 2023                             | 2022     | 2023                                              | 2022    | 2023                                                           | 2022  | 2023                                                             | 2022  | 2023                                                                | 2022    | 2023              | 2022                                            |                                                           |  |\n| Insurance revenue                                                  | 91,251                           | 86,985   | -

This includes underlying items that are not solely financial in nature, e.g., an entity's profit based on local accounting principles.\n\nThe composition of underlying items for contracts with direct participation features and their fair values are disclosed in the following table:\n\n### **Fair values of underlying items**\n\n|  | € mn |  |\n|--|------|--|\n|--|------|--|\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                         |                       | 2023        | 2022    |                       |             |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------|---------|\n|                                                                                           | Property<br>Casualty1 | Life/Health | Total   | Property<br>Casualty1 | Life/Health | Total   |\n| Equities                                                                                  | 1,925                 | 108,625     | 110,551 | 2,011                 | 112,475     | 114,486 |\n| Debt securities                                                                           | 6,859                 | 283,644     | 290,502 | 7,141                 | 269,365     | 276,506 |\n| Investment funds                                                                          | 25                    | 12,466      | 12,491  | 21                    | 13,446      | 13,466  |\n| Real estate                                                                               | 139                   | 12,501      | 12,640  | 110                   | 10,815      | 10,926  |\n| Fixed assets of alternative investments                                                   | -                     | 287         | 287     | -                     | 246         | 246     |\n| Derivatives                                                                               | -                     | 214         | 214     | -                     | 417         | 417     |\n| Financial assets for unit-linked contracts                                                | -                     | 112,707     | 112,707 | -                     | 102,894     | 102,894 |\n| Other                                                                                     | 2                     | 633         | 634     | 64                    | 204         | 267     |\n| Total                                                                                     | 8,950                 | 531,075     | 540,025 | 9,347                 | 509,863     | 519,209 |\n| 1_Consists mainly of the underlying items of the accident insurance with premium refunds. |                       |             |         |                       |             |         |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.14 \\_ Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table sets out sensitivities for the Allianz Group's shareholders' equity and shareholders' net income, as well as the CSM of the Life/Health business segment, reflecting relevant scenarios for market risk and insurance risk.\n\nDeriving these sensitivities requires complex and judgmental valuations. Furthermore, market developments or insurance events reflected in the scenarios would usually trigger management reactions to balance the impact, reflecting the overall circumstances and the variety of simultaneous sensitivities including cross effects. The impact taking into account these reactions cannot be reasonably reflected in a single number.\n\nThe sensitivities are thus calculating the theoretical impact of an instantaneous shock at the end of the reporting period. They do not fully take into account all management actions and indirect effects, such as changes in the asset allocation.\n\nConsequently, the shareholders' net income sensitivity should not be interpreted as a comprehensive reflection of the respective scenarios.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\n| As of 31 December                                                            |      |                         | 2023                        |         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|\n|                                                                              |      | Shareholders'<br>equity | Shareholders'<br>net income | CSM     |\n| Allianz Group                                                                |      |                         |                             |         |\n| Base amount                                                                  | € mn | 58,477                  | 8,541                       | 52,601  |\n| Equity markets up by 30 %                                                    | %    | 4                       | 12                          | 5       |\n| Equity markets down by 30 %                                                  | %    | (4)                     | (14)                        | (5)     |\n| Interest rates up by 0.5 %                                                   | %    | (0.5) - 0               | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Interest rates down by 0.5 %                                                 | %    | 0 - 0.5                 | (0.5) - 0                   | 0 - 0.5 |\n| Credit spread on government bonds up by 0.5 %                                | %    | (1)                     | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Credit spread on non-government bonds up by 0.5 %                            | %    | (1)                     | (0.5) - 0                   | (1)     |\n| Property-Casualty                                                            |      |                         |                             |         |\n| 1 in 10 years natural catastrophe excess loss                                | %    | (1)                     | (7)                         |         |\n| Life/Health                                                                  |      |                         |                             |         |\n| Lapse rates up by 10 %                                                       | %    | (0.5) - 0               | (1)                         | (3)     |\n| 1_CSM sensitivities are presented for the Life/Health business segment only. |      |                         |                             |         |\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.15 \\_ Claims development\n\nThe loss triangle is a tabular representation of loss-related data (such as payments, loss reserves, ultimate losses) in two time-related dimensions. One of these is the calendar year, the other is the accident year (year of loss occurrence). Loss triangles – as the basis for measuring loss reserves – express how the loss reserves change over the course of time due to payments made and new estimates of the expected ultimate loss at the respective reporting date.\n\nThe ultimate loss of an accident year comprises all payments made for that accident year up to the reporting date, plus the loss reserves at the reporting date. Given complete information regarding all losses incurred up to the reporting date, the ultimate loss for each accident-year period would remain unchanged. In practice, however, the ultimate loss (based on estimates) is exposed to fluctuations that reflect the increase in knowledge regarding the loss cases.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the following triangles, which show only figures of the Property-Casualty business segment, follow different accounting standards on the disclosure of the payments, loss reserves, and ultimate losses.\n\nCalendar years 2021 and prior are disclosed according to IFRS 4, meaning that the overall development of loss reserves considers undiscounted non-annuities and discounted annuities.\n\nCalendar years 2022 and onward are disclosed according to IFRS 17, hence loss development by accident year is fully on an undiscounted basis (for both annuities and non-annuities). A full reconciliation of the undiscounted reserves disclosed in below triangles to the net liabilities for incurred claims (LIC) is presented in the second table below. It should be noted, that a simplified approach has been used for the calendar year 2022 loss development. While the first disclosure of calendar year 2022 followed IFRS 4 accounting, the below restated calendar year 2022 loss developments are disclosed according to IFRS 17. The simplified approach adopted relies on the split by accident year of the undiscounted IFRS 4 reserves, applied on the IFRS 17 undiscounted reserves underlying the financial year 2023 opening balance sheet.\n\nThe data is only presented on a net basis, as this is considered to be more meaningful in order to represent the retained impact on Group results. The loss triangles are not prepared on a currencyadjusted basis. This means all figures are translated from the respective local currency into the Allianz Group presentation currency (euro), consistently using the exchange rates applicable at the respective reporting date. This ensures that the reserves reconcile with reserves in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n**Loss payments for the individual accident years (per calendar year, net)** € mn\n\n|               |

As of 31 December 2023, the derivative financial instruments used for the related fair value hedges of the Allianz Group had a total negative fair value of € 128 mn.\n\nThe ineffectiveness that arises from fair value hedges amounted to € (10) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n### **Cash flow hedges**\n\nCash flow hedges were used to hedge the exposure to the variability of cash flows arising from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations as well as inflation. As of 31 December 2023, the derivative instruments utilized had a total negative fair value of € 414 mn.\n\nThe ineffectiveness that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to € (1) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023. The change in the value of the hedging instrument recognized in other comprehensive income was € 948 mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n### **Hedges of net investment in foreign operations**\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group hedged part of its foreign currency net investments through the issuance of several foreign currency denominated liabilities and the use of forward contracts. The total negative fair value was € 107 mn for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Allianz Group enters into enforceable master netting arrangements and similar arrangements mainly for derivatives transactions. None of these enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements meet the requirements for offsetting in line with IAS 32.\n\nCredit risk associated with netting arrangements is further mitigated by collateral. For further information on collateral, please refer to [note 7.5.](#page-219-0) The maximum credit risk exposure is represented by the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nRegarding IBOR Reform, the transition to alternative benchmark rates affects two components, the risk-free rates for discounting cash flows in derivative transactions as well as reference rates of variable financial instruments and transactions.\n\nIn the meantime, the derivatives of the Allianz Group are fully migrated due to the already implemented transition of the risk-free discount rate in major currency blocks. For cash instruments, the transition of the risk-free discount rate and the transition of the reference rate Euribor used for the euro region, where the majority of the relevant financial instruments are, has already happened. The USD Libor transition happened by mid 2023. Overall the associated or expected effect of this transition is not material for the Allianz Group.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-219-0\"></span>7.5 \\_

The fair value is determined using the market and the income approach. Primary inputs for the market approach are quoted prices for identical or comparable assets in active markets, where comparability between the security and the benchmark defines the fair value level. The income approach in most cases means that a present value technique is applied where either the cash flows or the discount curve are adjusted to reflect credit risk and/or liquidity risk. Depending on the observability of these risk parameters in the market, the security is classified as level 2 or level 3.\n\nLevel 3 investments are mainly priced based on the income approach. The primary non-market observable input used in the discounted cash flow method is an option-adjusted spread taken from a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics. A significant yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a decreased fair value, while a significant yield decrease could result in an increased fair value. However, a 10% stress of the main non-market observable inputs has only immaterial impact on fair value.\n\n### **Equity investments in fair value through other comprehensive income and funds**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is mainly determined using the market approach or net asset value techniques for funds.\n\nLevel 3 mainly comprises private equity fund investments as well as alternative investments of the Allianz Group, and in most cases these are delivered as net asset values by the fund managers. These net asset values are calculated using material, non-public information about the respective private equity companies. The Allianz Group has only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers, hence a sensitivity analysis is not applicable. The fund's asset manager generally prices the underlying single portfolio companies in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines, using discounted cash flow (income approach) or multiple methods (market approach). For certain investments, the capital invested is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value. In these cases, sensitivity analyses are also not applicable.\n\n### **Derivatives**\n\nThe fair value of these derivatives is mostly determined based on the income approach, using present value techniques and the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Primary inputs for the valuation include volatilities, interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates \n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nobservable at commonly quoted intervals. In some cases, the fair value **Financial liabilities** is determined based on the market approach.\n\n### **Loans measured at fair value through other comprehensive income**\n\nFor loans measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, quoted market prices are rarely available. Level 1 mainly consists of highly liquid advances, e.g., short-term investments. The fair value for assets in level 2 and level 3 is mainly derived based on the income approach using deterministic discounted cash flow models.\n\n#### **Financial assets measured at amortized cost**\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized costs only include debt investments. For the valuation measurement please refer to the passage debt investments.\n\n#### **Associates and joint ventures**\n\nFor level 2 and level 3, fair values are mainly based on the income approach, using a discounted cash flow method or net asset values as provided by third-party vendors.\n\n### **Real estate held for investment**\n\nFair values are mostly determined using the market or the income approach. Valuation techniques applied for the market approach include market prices of comparable assets in markets that are not active. The fair values are either calculated internally and validated by external experts or derived from expert appraisals with internal controls in place to monitor these valuations.\n\n### **Financial assets for unit-linked contracts**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is determined using the market or the income approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models as well as the Black-Scholes-Merton model.\n\n### **Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss**\n\nThis position mainly includes derivative financial instruments.\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is determined using the income or the market approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models as well as the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Main observable input parameters include volatilities, yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, and credit spreads observable in the market.\n\nFor level 3, the fair value is determined using the income or the market approach. Valuation techniques applied for the income approach mainly include discounted cash flow models. A significant proportion of level 3 liabilities represent derivatives embedded in certain life insurance and annuity contracts. Significant non-market observable input parameters include mortality rates and surrender rates. A significant decrease (increase) in surrender rates, in mortality rates, or in the utilization of annuitization benefits could result in a higher (lower) fair value. For products with a high death benefit, surrender rates may show an opposite effect.\n\n#### **Liabilities to banks and customers**\n\nLevel 1 mainly consists of highly liquid liabilities, e.g., payables on demand. The fair value for liabilities in level 2 and level 3 is mainly derived based on the income approach, using future cash flows discounted with risk-specific interest rates. Main non-market observable inputs include credit spreads. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate of the fair value.\n\n#### **Certificated and subordinated liabilities**\n\nFor level 2, the fair value is mainly determined based on the market approach, using quoted market prices, and based on the income approach, using present value techniques. For level 3, fair values are mainly derived based on the income approach, using deterministic cash flows with credit spreads as primary non-market observable inputs. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate for the fair value.\n\n#### **Unit-linked investment contracts at fair value**\n\nFinancial liabilities for unit-linked investment contracts are valued based on their corresponding financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts.\n\n#### **Non-unit-linked investment contracts at cost**\n\nThe fair value for non-unit-linked investment contracts in level 2 is mainly derived based on the income approach, using future cash flows discounted with risk-specific interest rates. Main non-market observable inputs include credit spreads. In some cases, the carrying amount (amortized cost) is considered to be a reasonable estimate of the fair value.\n\nIn general, financial assets and liabilities are transferred from level 1 to level 2 when their liquidity, trade frequency, and activity are no longer indicative of an active market. The same policy applies conversely for transfers from level 2 to level 1.\n\nTransfers into/out of level 3 may occur due to a reassessment of input parameters.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group substantially retained all the risks and rewards from the ownership of transferred assets. There have not been any transfers of financial assets that were derecognized in full or partly in which Allianz continues to control the transferred assets. Transfers of financial assets mainly relate to securities lending and repurchase agreement transactions. Financial assets transferred in the context of repurchase agreement and securities lending transactions are mainly debt and equity securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income for which substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. As of 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the assets transferred for securities lending transactions amounted to € 6,329 mn (2022: € 8,008 mn).

Changes to applicable tax rates due to changes in tax law led to deferred tax income of € 0 mn (2022: € 2 mn).\n\nFor the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022, the income taxes relating to components of other comprehensive income consist of the following:\n\nThe recognized income taxes for the year ended 31 December 2023 are € 129 mn below (2022: € 443 mn above) the expected income taxes, which are determined by multiplying the respective income before income taxes with the applicable country-specific tax rates. The following table shows the reconciliation from the expected income taxes to the effectively recognized income taxes for the Allianz Group. The Allianz Group's reconciliation is a summary of the individual company-related reconciliations, which are based on the respective country-specific tax rates, taking into consideration consolidation effects with an impact on the Group result. The applicable tax rate used in the reconciliation for domestic Allianz Group companies includes corporate tax, trade tax, and the solidarity surcharge, and amounted to 31.0 % (2022: 31.0 %).\n\nThe effective tax rate is determined on the basis of the effective income tax expenses on income before income taxes.\n\n#### **Effective tax rate**\n\n€ mn\n\n|                                  | 2023   | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Income before income taxes       | 11,582 | 9,664 |\n| Applied weighted income tax rate | 23.1%  | 24.5% |\n| Expected income taxes            | 2,679  | 2,365 |\n| Trade tax and similar taxes      | 243    | 204   |\n| Net tax-exempt income            | (304)  | (142) |\n| Effects of tax losses            | (104)  | 56    |\n| Other effects                    | 36     | 325   |\n| Effective income taxes           | 2,550  | 2,808 |\n| Effective tax rate               | 22.0%  | 29.1% |\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the write-down of deferred taxes on tax losses carried forward increased the tax expenses by € 33 mn (2022: € 108 mn). The reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward resulted in deferred tax income of € 122 mn (2022: € 24 mn). Due to the use of tax losses carried forward, for which deferred tax assets had previously been written off, the current income tax expenses decreased by € 0 mn (2022: € 0 mn). Deferred tax income increased by € 16 mn (2022: € 29 mn) due to the use of tax losses carried forward, for which deferred tax assets had previously been written off. The aforementioned effects are shown in the reconciliation statement as \"effects of tax losses\".\n\nThe reconciling item \"other effects\" includes expenses of € 18 mn (2022: € 29 mn) related to the write-down of deferred tax assets on temporary differences and tax credits. Deferred tax income increased by € 0 mn (2022: € 0 mn) due to the reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets on temporary differences and tax credits.\n\nThe tax rates used in the calculation of the Allianz Group's deferred taxes are the applicable national rates, which in 2023 ranged from 10.0% to 40.0%, with changes to tax rates that had already been adopted in the Czech Republic and Türkiye by 31December 2023 taken into account.\n\nDeferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recognized to the extent to which it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable profits will be available for realization. Entities which suffered a tax loss in either the current or the preceding period recognized deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities amounting to € 4,271 mn (2022: € 3,644 mn), as there was convincing other evidence that sufficient future taxable profit will be available, including recovery of assets for more than their carrying amount.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Deferred tax assets and liabilities**\n\n€ mn\n\n| € mn                                                                                            |          |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                               | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                                             |          |          |\n| Investments                                                                                     | 28,643   | 35,054   |\n| Insurance contract assets/liabilities                                                           | 20,457   | 17,984   |\n| Other assets                                                                                    | 2,025    | 2,385    |\n| Intangible assets                                                                               | 150      | 148      |\n| Tax losses carried forward                                                                      | 2,541    | 2,379    |\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                                                | 2,066    | 1,957    |\n| Other liabilities                                                                               | 4,152    | 3,248    |\n| Total deferred tax assets                                                                       | 60,034   | 63,155   |\n| Non-recognition or valuation allowance for<br>deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward | (704)    | (684)    |\n| Effect of netting                                                                               | (53,338) | (56,103) |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                                                         | 5,992    | 6,369    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                                        |          |          |\n| Investments                                                                                     | 20,266   | 21,629   |\n| Insurance contract assets/liabilities                                                           | 27,536   | 28,541   |\n| Other assets                                                                                    | 2,564    | 1,729    |\n| Intangible assets                                                                               | 1,459    | 1,463    |\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                                                | 628      | 714      |\n| Other liabilities                                                                               | 3,009    | 4,183    |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities                                                                  | 55,462   | 58,261   |\n| Effect of netting                                                                               | (53,338) | (56,103) |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities                                                                    | 2,124    | 2,158    |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                                                           | 3,868    | 4,210    |\n\nTax losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 of € 9,653 mn (2022: € 9,307 mn) resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent that there is sufficient certainty that the unused tax losses will be utilized. At the reporting date, this prerequisite was considered not fulfilled for a partial amount of € 2,839 mn (2022: € 2,752 mn). According to tax legislation as of 31 December 2023, an amount of € 2,599 mn (2022: € 2,519 mn) of these tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely, whereas an amount of € 240 mn (2022: € 233 mn) of these tax losses carried forward will expire over the next 20 years if not utilized.\n\nTax losses carried forward are scheduled according to their expiry periods as follows:\n\n#### **Tax losses carried forward**\n\n| € mn      |       |\n|-----------|-------|\n| 2023      |       |\n| 2024      | 15    |\n| 2025-2026 | 44    |\n| 2027-2028 | 746   |\n| 2029-2033 | 239   |\n| >10 years | 2,060 |\n| Unlimited | 6,550 |\n| Total     | 9,653 |\n\nAs Allianz is able to control the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences arising from investments in Allianz Group companies, deferred tax liabilities are only recognized to the extent these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. For an amount of € 4,589 mn (2022: € 4,664 mn) no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, because they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. For deductible temporary differences arising from investments in Allianz Group companies in the amount of € 355 mn (2022: € 437 mn) no deferred tax assets are recognized because it is not probable that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nUnder the Pillar Two legislation, a multinational Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its Pillar Two effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15 % minimum rate. The Allianz Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two rules. The Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Germany, the jurisdiction in which Allianz SE as the ultimate parent entity of the Allianz Group is incorporated, and is applicable starting from 1 January 2024. As of the reporting date, local Pillar Two legislations were not applicable in any of the jurisdictions in which Allianz Group entities are domiciled.\n\nTherefore, the Allianz Group has no related current tax exposure. The Allianz Group applies the exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\nThe Allianz Group is not expecting any material impacts from the OECD Pillar Two rules. Impacts are expected in jurisdictions Allianz is situated that have an overall enacted income tax rate of below 15 %, like Bulgaria, Ireland, and Liechtenstein, or in countries with a potential Pillar Two effective tax rate of below 15 %, like China, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.\n\n# <span id=\"page-228-0\"></span>8.5 \\_ Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are generally calculated by dividing net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. According to IFRS, the net income attributable to shareholders was adjusted for net financial charges related to undated subordinated bonds classified as shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Allianz Group recognized net financial charges of € (142) mn for 2023 (2022: € (119) mn).\n\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the nominator and denominator are adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive shares. These effects arise from various share-based compensation plans of the Allianz Group.\n\n#### **Earnings per share** € mn\n\n|                                                            | 2023        | 2022        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to shareholders –<br>basic         | 8,399       | 6,302       |\n| Effect of potentially dilutive shares                      | (6)         | (13)        |\n| Net income attributable to shareholders –<br>diluted       | 8,393       | 6,289       |\n| Weighted-average number of shares<br>outstanding – basic   | 396,190,104 | 404,793,132 |\n| Potentially dilutive shares                                | 125,880     | 1,467,572   |\n| Weighted-average number of shares<br>outstanding – diluted | 396,315,983 | 406,260,704 |\n| Basic earnings per share (€)                               | 21.20       | 15.57       |\n| Diluted earnings per share (€)                             | 21.18       | 15.48       |\n\nThe Allianz Group also uses core earnings per share as a measure for profitability per share.

The Allianz Group applies generally acknowledged valuation principles to determine the value in use.\n\nFor all CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for the CGU Asset Management, the Allianz Group mainly uses the discounted earnings method to derive the value in use. Generally, the basis for the determination of the discounted earnings value is the business plan (\"detailed planning period\") as well as the estimate of the sustainable returns and eternal growth rates, which can be assumed to be realistic on a long-term basis (\"terminal value\") for the operating entities included in the CGU. The discounted earnings value is calculated by discounting the future earnings using an appropriate discount rate. The business plans applied in the value in use calculations are the results of the structured management dialogues between the Board of Management of Allianz SE and the operating entities in connection with a reporting process integrated into these dialogues. Generally, the business plans comprise a planning horizon of three years and are based on the current market environment.\n\nThe terminal values are largely based on the expected profits of the final year of the detailed planning period. Where necessary, the planned profits are adjusted to reflect long-term sustainable earnings. The financing of the assumed eternal growth in the terminal values is accounted for by appropriate profit retention.\n\nIn the prior years, the value in use for all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment was mainly based on an Appraisal Value method which was derived from the Market Consistent Embedded Value and a multiple of the New Business Value (VNB) calculation.\n\nIn 2023 for all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment, the value in use is mainly derived from the IFRS net asset value (NAV), a New Business Value calculation (VNB), and a multiple of the value of New Business. For valuation purposes, the Allianz Group defines the NAV as the sum of the IFRS total equity without goodwill plus the CSM net of tax, net of reinsurance and net of the present value of non-attributable costs. This NAV reflects the in-force value including expected profits in the form of CSM. As it is based on the IFRS balance sheet, the NAV reflects a market consistent valuation in line with core steering measures applied at the Allianz Group, in particular (net) CSM and VNB.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 9 and 17 standards is a fundamental new development in the financial reporting process for insurance entities. Considering the key advantages of these standards for insurance entities, the Allianz Group changed the input basis for the value in use calculation to the IFRS balance sheet for year-end 2023. The change in the input assumption from embedded value or appraisal value to an IFRS balance sheet basis is recognized as an IAS 8 change of estimate.\n\nIn the Corporate and Other business segment, the value in use in the Digital Investments is derived by using the discounted cash flow and multiple method. Discounted cash flows are calculated based on the companies' business plan as well as an estimate of sustainable returns and eternal growth rates (terminal value). The discounted earnings value is calculated by discounting the future earnings using an appropriate discount rate. For the multiple method, transactions and revenues of comparable companies are used.\n\n### **Significant assumptions**\n\nIn determining the business plans, certain key assumptions were made in order to project future earnings.\n\nFor entities included in the CGUs of the Property-Casualty business segment, the business plans are mainly based on key assumptions including expense ratio, loss ratio, investment income, risk capital, market share, premium rate changes, and taxes. The bases for determining the values assigned to the key assumptions are current market trends and earnings projections.\n\nThe discount rate is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and appropriate eternal growth rates. The assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, segment beta, and leverage ratio used to calculate the discount rates, are generally consistent with the parameters used in the Allianz Group's planning and controlling process. The discount rates and eternal growth rates for the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment are as follows:\n\n#### **Discount rates and eternal growth rates for the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment1**\n\n%\n\n|                                                                         | 2023             |                        | 2022             |                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Discount<br>rate | Eternal<br>growth rate | Discount<br>rate | Eternal<br>growth rate |\n| Insurance German<br>Speaking Countries                                  | 8.1              | 0.5                    | 7.6              | 0.4                    |\n| Insurance Western &<br>Southern Europe                                  | 10.1             | 1.7                    | 7.9              | 0.5                    |\n| Insurance Asia<br>Pacific                                               | 9.6              | 1.5                    | 9.7              | 2.0                    |\n| Insurance Iberia &<br>Latin America                                     | 15.1             | 3.6                    | 11.1             | 2.7                    |\n| Insurance Central &<br>Eastern Europe                                   | 9.8              | 1.8                    | 9.4              | 1.5                    |\n| Global Insurance<br>Lines & Anglo<br>Markets, Middle East<br>and Africa | 9.2              | 1.4                    | 9.0              | 1.0                    |\n| Specialty Lines I                                                       | 9.0              | 1.2                    | 8.3              | 0.7                    |\n| Specialty Lines II                                                      | 9.2              | 1.1                    | 8.4              | 0.5                    |\n\n1\\_The table provides an overview of weighted key parameters on the CGU level of the countryspecific discount rates and eternal growth rates used.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor entities included in the CGUs of the Life/Health business segment, the valuation is based on the NAV that reflects the in-force value including the expected profits in the form of the CSM. The CSM is part of the insurance contract liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet consisting of the present value of future cash flows, a risk adjustment, and the value of unearned profits. These unearned profits are also included from a shareholder's perspective for the company value, i.e., after tax and reinsurance.\n\nThe present value of future cash flows corresponds to the probability-weighted average of future cash flows considering the time value of money, using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. The calculation of the best estimate is based on assumptions made for demographic factors (e.g., mortality, morbidity, lapse/surrender rates), expense allowances, taxation, assumptions on market conditions for market consistent projections (e.g., reference rates, volatilities) as well as investment strategy and asset allocation of the entity. The risk adjustment reflects an additional provision to account for the uncertainty in future cash flows with respect to nonfinancial risk. For further information regarding the different components, please refer to the section \"Insurance contracts\" i[n note](#page-156-1) 2.\n\nThe VNB calculation is based on a best estimate of one year of VNB, multiplied by a factor (multiple) to capture expected future new business. The best estimate of new business is generally derived from the achieved value of new business. The new business multiple accounts for the risk and the growth associated with future new business analogous to the discount rate and the growth rate in a discounted earnings method. For all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment, a multiple of not more than ten times the VNB is applied.\n\nFor entities included in the CGU of the Asset Management business segment, key assumptions include assets under management growth, cost-income ratio, and risk capital. The key assumptions are based on the current market environment. The discount rate for the CGU Asset Management is 12.0 % (2022: 10.8 %) and the eternal growth rate is 2.6% (2022: 1.3%).\n\nFor the Digital Investments included in the Corporate and Other business segment, the bases for determining the values assigned to the key assumptions are current market trends and earnings projections. The discount rate is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and appropriate eternal growth rates. The discount rate and the eternal growth rates are calculated in line with market practice and are subject to company-specific factors, its development status, and the markets in which the company operates.\n\n### **Sensitivity analyses**\n\nSensitivity analyses were performed with regard to discount rates and key value drivers of the business plans.\n\nFor the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for the CGU Asset Management, sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the long-term sustainable combined ratios/cost-income ratios and the discount rate. For all CGUs discounted earnings, value sensitivities still exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\n\nIn the Life/Health business segment, sensitivity analyses were performed mainly based on NAV and VNB sensitivity testing on the reference rate. The analyses have shown that in case of a change in reference rates by 50 basis points, the value in use of each CGU still exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nIn the Corporate and Other business segment, a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to earnings and interest rates for the Digital Investments. The analysis has shown that in case of an increase in the interest rates by 50 basis points and under consideration of a holding period usual for the asset class, the recoverable amount approximates its carrying value.\n\n# <span id=\"page-233-1\"></span><span id=\"page-233-0\"></span>8.10 \\_ Equity\n\n### **Equity**\n\n| € mn                                                       |          |          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| As of 31 December                                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Shareholders' equity                                       |          |          |\n| Issued capital                                             | 1,170    | 1,170    |\n| Additional paid-in capital                                 | 27,732   | 27,732   |\n| Undated subordinated bonds                                 | 4,764    | 4,843    |\n| Retained earnings1                                         | 30,702   | 29,354   |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments                   | (2,883)  | (3,048)  |\n| Unrealized gains and losses from insurance contracts (net) | 34,207   | 54,854   |\n| Other unrealized gains and losses (net)2,3                 | (37,215) | (60,490) |\n| Subtotal                                                   | 58,477   | 54,415   |\n| Non-controlling interests                                  | 5,103    | 4,320    |\n| Total                                                      | 63,580   | 58,735   |\n\n1\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € (38) mn (2022: € (333) mn) related to treasury shares. 2\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € 844 mn (2022: € 1,059 mn) related to expected credit losses. 3\\_As of 31 December 2023, includes € (818) mn (2022: € (1,460) mn) related to cash flow hedges.\n\nIssued capital as of 31 December 2023 amounted to € 1,170 mn, divided into 391,718,983 fully paid registered shares.

Such treasury shares are not entitled to the dividend pursuant to §71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Should there be any change in the number of shares entitled to the dividend by the date of the Annual General Meeting, the above proposal will be amended accordingly and presented for resolution on the appropriation of net earnings at the Annual General Meeting, with an unchanged dividend of € 13.80 per each share entitled to dividend.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE held 260,394 (2022: 1,724,834) treasury shares. Of these, 60,394 (2022: 54,482) were held for covering future subscriptions by employees in Germany and abroad in the context of Employee Stock Purchase Plans. 200,000 (2022: 200,000) were held as a hedge for obligations from the Allianz Equity Incentive Program.\n\nIn 2023, 818,526 (2022: 964,487) treasury shares were transferred to employees of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries in Germany and abroad. This includes 104,383 (2022: 87,172) shares granted as part of the so-called \"free share program\" (\"Gratisaktienprogramm\"). The 54,482 (2022: 38,720) treasury shares earmarked for the purposes of Employee Stock Purchase Plans from the previous year were fully consumed and, in addition, 824,435 (2022: 980,249) treasury shares were acquired from the market for this purpose. In addition, 10,240 (2022: 0) shares were acquired from the market and transferred free of charge to tied agents in Germany.\n\nAs in the previous years, no capital increase for the purpose of Employee Stock Purchase Plans was carried out in 2023. Employees of the Allianz Group purchased approximately 75% of the shares of the purchase plan at a reference price of € 224.11 (2022: € 164.61) per share and were allocated one additional share per three shares purchased, which is equivalent to a discount of approximately 25%. The shares were sold to employees at an average price of € 168.08 (2022: € 123.46).\n\nIn the year ending 31 December 2023, the total number of treasury shares of Allianz SE decreased by 1,464,440, which corresponds to a decrease by € 4 mn or by 0.37% of issued capital.\n\nThe treasury shares of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries represented € 0.8 mn (2022: € 5.0 mn) or 0.07% (2022: 0.43%) of the issued capital.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, a total dividend of € 4,541 mn (2022: € 4,383 mn), or € 11.40 (2022: € 10.80) per qualifying share, was paid to the shareholders.\n\nIn its meeting on 9 November 2022, the Board of Management of Allianz SE resolved to carry out a share buy-back program in an amount of up to € 1 bn within a period between mid-November 2022 and 31 December 2023 (Share Buy-Back Program 2022/II), based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022. In the period between 21 November 2022 and 17 March 2023, a total of 4,682,857 treasury shares with a market value of € 999,999,983.29 were acquired for an average price of € 213.54.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn its meeting on 10 May 2023, the Board of Management of Allianz SE resolved to carry out an additional share buy-back program in an amount of up to € 1.5 bn within a period between end of May 2023 and 31 December 2023 (Share Buy-Back Program 2023), based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022. In the period between 29 May 2023 and 24 November 2023, a total of 6,912,156 treasury shares with a market value of € 1,499,999,820.26 were acquired for an average price of € 217.01.\n\nAll of the treasury shares acquired within the Share Buy-Back Programs 2022/II and 2023 have been redeemed according to the simplified procedure without reduction of the share capital.\n\n#### **Non-controlling interests**\n\n| € mn                              |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| As of 31 December                 | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Unrealized gains and losses (net) | (180) | (236  |\n| Share of earnings                 | 491   | 435   |\n| Other equity components           | 4,792 | 4,123 |\n| Total                             | 5,103 | 4,320 |\n\nThe Allianz Group's capital requirements primarily depend on the type of business that it underwrites, the industry and geographic locations in which it operates, and the allocation of the Allianz Group's investments. During the Allianz Group's annual planning and strategic dialogues with its related undertakings, internal capital requirements are determined through business plans regarding the levels and timing of capital expenditures and investments. These plans also form the basis for the Allianz Group's capital management. Resilience under stress conditions is also considered when determining the internal capital requirements of the Group. The regulators impose minimum capital requirements on the Group and its related undertakings. For further details on how Allianz Group manages its capital, please refer to the section \"Target and strategy of risk management\" of the [Risk](#page-129-0)  [and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nWith Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the Group as of 1 January 2016, the risk profile is measured and steered based on the approved Solvency II internal model<sup>1</sup>. The Allianz Group has introduced a target Solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.\n\nThe Allianz Group's Own Funds are composed of the eligible Own Funds relating to the Group of internal model and standard formula entities, the sectoral Own Funds of entities from other financial sectors, as well as the equivalent Own Funds of entities included via the deduction and aggregation (D&A) method. The eligible Own Funds relating to the Group of internal model and standard formula entities essentially consist of the MVBS excess of assets over liabilities plus qualifying subordinated liabilities, less deductions for foreseeable dividends as well as further deductions relating, for example, to transferability restrictions.\n\nBased on the information available to the Allianz Group as of the end of 31 December 2023 and with a Solvency II capitalization of 206 % (2022: 201 %)<sup>2</sup>, it is expected that the Group continues to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the minimum consolidated Group Solvency Capital Requirement. For further information on Solvency II capitalization, please refer to the section \"Solvency II regulatory capitalization\" of th[e Risk and Opportunity Report.](#page-129-0)\n\nThe Allianz Group is a financial conglomerate within the scope of the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FCD). The FCD does not impose a materially different capital requirement on Allianz Group compared to Solvency II.\n\nThe Allianz Group's insurance subsidiaries (including Allianz SE) prepare individual financial statements based on local laws and regulations. The local regulations establish additional restrictions on the minimum level of capital and the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders. The respective local minimum capital requirements are based on various criteria including, but not limited to, the volume of premiums written or claims paid, amount of insurance reserves, investment risks, credit risks, and underwriting risks.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group believes that there are no outstanding regulatory capital or compliance matters that would have material adverse effects on the financial position or the results of <span id=\"page-235-1\"></span>operations of the Allianz Group. For further information on the Structured Alpha matter please refer to [note 8.13.](#page-237-0)\n\nSome insurance subsidiaries of the Allianz Group are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be remitted to Allianz SE without prior approval by the appropriate regulatory body. These restrictions require that a company may only pay dividends up to an amount in excess of certain regulatory capital levels, or based on the levels of undistributed earned surplus or current year income or a percentage thereof. The Allianz Group's Board of Management believes that these restrictions will not affect the ability of Allianz SE to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future.\n\n# <span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>8.11 \\_ Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nUnder IFRS 12, a structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting rights or similar rights held by an investor are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Allianz Group engages in some business activities that involve the use of entities that meet the above-mentioned definition of structured entities. Primarily, the Allianz Group is involved with such entities due to its investment activities associated with its insurance business and due to its asset management activities. Furthermore, structured entities are used by the Allianz Group to source out certain risks to investors as part of its reinsurance business. Generally, the classification of an entity as a structured entity may require significant judgment.\n\nIn the following sections, the business activities involving unconsolidated structured entities are described.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\\_From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems the model to be \"partial\" because not all of the related entities are using the internal model. Some of the smaller entities report under the standard formula and others under the deduction and aggregation approach. Without loss of\n\ngenerality, the term internal model might be used in the following chapters, e.g., in case descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on processes with respect to the internal model components.\n\n<sup>2</sup>\\_Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions, the Solvency II capitalization ratio amounts to 229 % as of 31.12.2023 (2022: 230 %).\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Investments in asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by securitization vehicles**\n\nThe Allianz Group acts as an investor in ABS- or MBS-issuing securitization vehicles that purchase pools of assets, including commercial mortgage loans (CMBS), auto loans, credit card receivables, and others. These securitization vehicles refinance the purchase of assets by issuing tranches of ABS or MBS whose repayment is linked to the performance of the assets held by the vehicles.\n\nSecuritization vehicles invested in by the Allianz Group have generally been set up by third parties. Furthermore, the Allianz Group has neither transferred any assets to these vehicles nor has it provided any further credit enhancements to them.\n\nIncome derived from investments in securitization vehicles mainly includes interest income generated from ABS and MBS, as well as realized gains and losses from disposals of these securities.\n\nWithin the asset management business, the Allianz Group acts as asset manager for some securitization vehicles. The assets under management of these vehicles amounted to € 3,884 mn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 3,051 mn). Some of the affected vehicles have been set up by the Allianz Group, others by third parties. In this context, the role of the Allianz Group is limited to asset management.\n\nIncome derived from the management of securitization vehicles comprises asset management fees.\n\n### **Investments in investment funds**\n\nConsidering the broad variety of investment funds across different jurisdictions, the classification of investment funds as structured entities based on the definition in IFRS 12 is judgmental. As a general rule, the management of relevant activities of an investment fund is delegated to the fund manager via asset management agreements. In contrast, influence from investors on the relevant activities of investment funds is usually either precluded by legal or regulatory provisions or not deemed substantial.\n\nInvestment funds are generally subject to stringent regulatory requirements from financial authorities in all jurisdictions across the world. Comprehensive regulation of funds protects fund investors and also helps to limit investment risk. These mechanisms result in a legal set-up of funds that the Allianz Group has to accept as investor and which may lead to a classification as structured entities under IFRS 12.\n\nWith regard to investment activities, income mainly includes distributions from the funds as well as realized gains and losses from disposals.\n\n### **Asset management activities**\n\nWithin the asset management business, investment funds are established and managed to accommodate retail and institutional clients' requirements to hold investments in specific asset classes, market segments, or regions. Within the insurance business, policyholder money is partly invested in investment funds managed by Allianz's group-internal asset managers. Investment funds managed by the Allianz Group may include mutual funds, special funds, and other funds.\n\nIncome derived from the management of investment funds mainly includes asset management fees and performance-based fees.\n\nInvestment funds launched by group-internal asset managers can be considered to be sponsored by the Allianz Group. As a sponsor, the Allianz Group is involved in the legal set-up and marketing of internally managed investment funds through its asset management subsidiaries. This may include providing seed capital to the funds and providing administrative services to ensure the investment funds' operation. Investment funds managed by group-internal asset managers can be reasonably associated with the Allianz Group. The use of the Allianz name for investment funds is another indicator that the Allianz Group has acted as a sponsor for the respective funds. Information on the management fees generated in the asset management business is disclosed i[n note](#page-226-0) 8.1.\n\n**Nature of risks associated with unconsolidated structured entities**\n\n### **Interests in asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by securitization vehicles**\n\n#### **Carrying amounts of ABS and MBS investments by type of category** € mn\n\n| As of 31 December | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| CMBS              | 8,383  | 9,783  |\n| CMO/CDO           | 7,652  | 6,897  |\n| U.S. agency       | 2,818  | 2,730  |\n| Auto              | 737    | 558    |\n| Other             | 8,514  | 6,435  |\n| Total1,2          | 28,104 | 26,402 |\n\n1\\_Comprises mainly investments.\n\n2\\_Thereof rated AAA or AA € 19,947 mn (2022: € 20,229 mn).\n\nThe carrying amounts in the tables listed above correspond to an aggregated amortized cost amount of € 29,791 mn (2022: € 28,902 mn).

Furthermore, the Allianz Group has entered commitments to invest in private equity funds and further financial instruments of up to € 35,346 mn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 36,605 mn).\n\nThe carrying amounts in the tables listed above correspond to an aggregated amortized cost amount of € 63,231 mn (2022: € 56,538 mn). In a very extreme scenario, this amortized cost amount represents the maximum exposure to loss for the Allianz Group from these investments. In the reporting period, the Allianz Group has not provided any financial or other support to these entities, nor does it have the intention to provide such support in the future.\n\nBesides the investments in investment funds described above, the Allianz Group also holds investment funds to fund unit-linked insurance contracts. However, these holdings are held on behalf and for the benefit of unit-linked policyholders only. For that reason, these holdings are not included in the table above. As of 31 December 2023, the volume of unit-linked assets amounted to € 152,872 mn (2022: € 141,034 mn). Any exposure to loss on these investments is solely borne by the unit-linked policyholder.\n\n## 8.12 \\_ Related party transactions\n\nDetailed information on the remuneration of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board according to the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code are disclosed in the [Remuneration](#page-25-0)  [Report.](#page-25-0) The following descriptions are made in accordance with IAS 24.17 and IAS 24.18.\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Management consists of a fixed remuneration component and a performance-based remuneration component:\n\n- − The fixed remuneration component comprises the base salary, perquisites (e.g., contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and a company car) and pension contributions. The pension contributions of the company to the current defined contribution pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\" are generally 15% of the target remuneration of the Board members.\n- − The performance-based variable remuneration includesthe shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. The long-term, share-based compensation (Long-Term Incentive – LTI) is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the longterm development of key performance indicators is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration of the Board of Management:\n\n**Remuneration of the Board of Management (expenses of the year)** € mn\n\n| As of 31 December             | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| Short-term employee benefits1 | 21   | 22   |\n| Post-employment benefits      | 5    | 6    |\n| Share-based payment           | 28   | 17   |\n| Total                         | 54   | 46   |\n\n1\\_Includes base salary, perquisites as well as short-term annual bonus.\n\nExisting provisions are mainly related to post-employment benefits and share-based payment. As of 31 December 2023, reserves for pensions and similar benefits for active members of the Board of Management amounted to € 35 mn (2022: € 35 mn). Provisions for share-based payment amounted to € 47 mn (2022: € 40 mn).\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE consists of a fixed remuneration, committee-related remuneration, as well as attendance fees and reimbursement of expenses. These are considered as short-term employee benefits. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board was € 4 mn (2022: € 3 mn).\n\nTransactions between Allianz SE and its subsidiaries that are to be deemed related parties have been eliminated in the consolidation and are not disclosed in the notes.\n\nBusiness relations with joint ventures and associates are set on an arm's length basis and are mainly related to loans (please refer to note [7.2.4\\)](#page-213-0) and reinsurance agreements.\n\nFor information on the formation of the partnership with Sanlam Ltd., please se[e note](#page-169-0) 3.\n\n# <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>8.13 \\_ Litigation, guarantees, commitments, and other contingencies\n\nAllianz Group companies are involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and a number of foreign jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business, including, amongst others, their activities as insurance, banking and asset management companies, employers, investors and taxpayers. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in adverse publicity and damage to the Allianz Group's reputation. As a result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on the Allianz Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. Apart from the proceedings discussed below, Allianz SE is not aware of any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its and/or the Allianz Group's financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz Group companies are involved include in particular the following:\n\nIn January 2023 a putative class action complaint has been filed against Allianz SE and, in its amended version, against AllianzGI U.S. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges violation of Federal U.S. Securities Laws by making false or misleading statements in public disclosures such as the annual reports of Allianz in the period between March 2018 and May 2022 regarding the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha matter and internal controls. Allianz SE considers the action to be unfounded.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Guarantees**\n\n| € mn                     |       |      |\n|--------------------------|-------|------|\n| As of 31 December        | 2023  | 2022 |\n| Financial guarantees     | 803   | 54   |\n| Non-financial guarantees | 790   | 929  |\n| Total                    | 1,593 | 983  |\n\n### **Commitments**\n\n€ mn\n\n| € mn                                                                                     |        |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As of 31 December                                                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Commitments to acquire interests in joint ventures,<br>associates and equity investments | 35,346 | 36,605 |\n| Commitments to purchase debt investments                                                 | 7,383  | 8,072  |\n| Other commitments                                                                        | 3,465  | 4,164  |\n| Total                                                                                    | 46,194 | 48,843 |\n\n**Reconciliation of gross carrying amount for financial guarantees and commitments to purchase debt investments as of 31 December 2023 and 2022**\n\n|                                                                   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| As of 1 January                                                   | 8,126   | 6,283   |\n| Additions                                                         | 3,104   | 2,713   |\n| Changes in the consolidated subsidiaries of the<br>Allianz Group  | -       | -       |\n| Changes in models and risk parameters and due to<br>modifications | -       | -       |\n| Matured or sold                                                   | (942)   | (1,590) |\n| Reclassifications between stages                                  | -       | (34)    |\n| Write-offs                                                        | -       | -       |\n| Amortization                                                      | -       | -       |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments                          | (91)    | 51      |\n| Other changes                                                     | (2,011) | 703     |\n| As of 31 December                                                 | 8,186   | 8,126   |\n\nAny material contingent liabilities resulting from litigation matters are captured in the litigation section above.\n\nPursuant to §§221 et seq. of the German Insurance Supervision Act (\"Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – VAG\"), mandatory insurance guarantee schemes (\"Sicherungsfonds\") for life insurers as well as for health insurers are implemented in Germany, which are financed through their member undertakings.\n\nThe insurance guarantee scheme for life insurers levies annual contributions and, under certain circumstances, special contributions. As of 31 December 2023, the future liabilities of Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries of Allianz SE to the insurance guarantee scheme pursuant to the SichLVFinV amount to annual contributions of € 32.1 mn (2022: € 4.8 mn) and potential special contributions of, in principle, € 357 mn (2022: € 303 mn) per year. In addition, Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries have assumed a contractual obligation to provide, if required, further funds to Protektor Lebensversicherungs-AG (\"Protektor\"), a life insurance company that has assumed the task of the mandatory insurance guarantee scheme for life insurers. Such obligation is, in principle, based on a maximum of 1% of the sum of the net underwriting reserves with deduction of payments already provided to the insurance guarantee scheme. As of 31 December 2023, and under inclusion of the contributions to the mandatory insurance scheme mentioned above for a limited period of time, and assuming that no other life insurer is exempted from payments, the aggregate outstanding commitment of Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and further subsidiaries to the insurance guarantee scheme and to Protektor is € 3,243 mn (2022: € 2,734 mn).\n\n# 8.14 \\_ Hyperinflationary economies\n\nSubsidiaries of the Allianz Group that operate in Türkiye and Argentina have to apply hyperinflation accounting in accordance with IAS 29.\n\nIn applying IAS 29, the Allianz Group has adopted the accounting policy to present the combined effect of the restatement in accordance with IAS 29 and the translation according to IAS 21 as a net change for the year in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe identities and levels of the price indices applied by the operating entities concerned are as follows:\n\n#### **Hyperinflationary economies**\n\n|           | Index                                                                                   | As of<br>31 December<br>2023 | As of<br>31 December<br>2022 |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Türkiye   | Consumer Price Index<br>published by the Turkish<br>Statistical Institute<br>(TURKSTAT) | 1,859.38                     | 1,128.45                     |\n| Argentina | Consumer Price Index<br>published by the Argentinian<br>Statistical Institute           | 3,533.19                     | 1,134.59                     |\n\nOverall, for the year ended 31 December 2023, the application of hyperinflation accounting according to IAS 29 had a negative impact on net income of € (264) mn (2022: € (282) mn).

Investment property comprises a number of commercial properties that are leased to third parties.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the maturities for the future minimum lease payments of operating leases were as follows:\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>\n\n| As of 31 December           | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|\n| One year and less           | 1,110 | 916   |\n| Between 1 and up to 2 years | 948   | 778   |\n| Between 2 and up to 3 years | 855   | 702   |\n| Between 3 and up to 4 years | 765   | 599   |\n| Between 4 and up to 5 years | 502   | 496   |\n| More than 5 years           | 1,730 | 1,690 |\n| Total                       | 5,909 | 5,181 |\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 8.16 \\_ Pensions and similar obligations\n\nRetirement benefits in the Allianz Group, which are granted to employees and in Germany also to agents, are either in the form of defined benefit or defined contribution plans. For defined benefit plans, the beneficiary is granted a defined benefit by the employer or via an external entity. In contrast to defined contribution arrangements, the future cost to the employer of a defined benefit plan is not known with certainty in advance.\n\nThe Allianz Group provides competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability benefits using risk-appropriate vehicles. The plans may vary from country to country due to the different legal, fiscal, and economic environments.\n\nRisks typically associated with defined benefit plans are biometric risks such as longevity, disability, and death, as well as economic risks such as interest rates, inflation, and compensation increases. New plans are primarily based on contributions and may include, in some cases, guarantees such as the preservation of contributions or minimum interest rates.\n\nEach of the pension plans in Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland contributes more than 5% to the Allianz Group's defined benefit obligation or its plan assets. As the Allianz Retirement and Death Benefits Fund in the U.K. closed from 1 July 2015 to future accrual and the plans in Switzerland are nearly negligible from a risk perspective, except a minor liquidity risk due to the \"Freizügigkeitsleistung\", only the defined benefit plans in Germany are described in more detail regarding key risks and regulatory environment.\n\nMost active German employees participate in contributionbased plans using different vehicles to cover the base salary both below and above the German social security ceiling (GSSC). Since 1 January 2015, the Allianz Group contributes for new entrants and for the majority of contribution-based pension plan beneficiaries to the low-risk pension plan \"My Allianz Pension\", where only contributions are preserved. For salaries above the GSSC, the Allianz Group decides each year whether and to which extent a budget for the contribution-based pension plans is provided. Independently of this decision, an additional risk premium is paid to cover death and disability. Generally the accruals of the contributionbased pension plans are wholly funded, whereas the grandfathered plans are funded to a minor extent. On retirement, the accumulated capital is paid as a lump sum or converted to a lifetime annuity.\n\nEmployees who joined Allianz before 1 January 2015 participate in the Allianz Versorgungskasse VVaG (AVK), financed through employee contributions, and the Allianz Pensionsverein e.V. (APV), which is financed by the employer. Both pension funds provide pension benefits for the base salary up to the GSSC, are wholly funded along local regulatory requirements, and were closed to new entrants, effective 31 December 2014. AVK and APV are legally separate administered pension funds with trustee boards being responsible for the investment of the assets and the risk management. AVK is subject to German insurance regulation. The assets of the contribution-based pension plans are allocated to a trust (Methusalem Trust e.V.) and managed by a board of trustees. For the AVK, the annual minimum interest rate guaranteed is 1.75% – 3.50%, depending on the date of joining the Allianz Group, and for the closed part of the contributionbased pension plan it is 2.75%.\n\nThere is also a partly funded defined benefit pension plan for agents (\"VertreterVersorgungsWerk, VVW\"), which has been closed for new entrants since 31 December 2011. A part of the pension plan serves as a replacement for the compensatory claim of agents according to German Commercial Code (§89b). VVW is similar to a final salary benefit plan.\n\nPension increases apart from AVK and APV are guaranteed at 1% p.a. at a minimum. Depending on legal requirements, some pension increases are linked to inflation. In AVK, the complete surplus share of the retirees is used to increase their pension.\n\nThe period in which a retirement benefit can be drawn is usually between the ages of 60 and 67. Disability benefits are granted until retirement pension is paid. In the case of death under the previous plans, surviving dependents normally receive 60% (widow/widower) and 20% (per child) of the original employee's pension, in total not to exceed 100%. Under the \"My Allianz Pension\" plan, the surviving dependents receive the capital accrued.\n\nAdditionally, the Allianz Group offers a deferred compensation program, \"Pensionszusage durch Entgeltumwandlung (PZE)\", for active employees. Within some boundaries they convert at their discretion parts of their gross income and, in exchange, receive a pension commitment of equal value.

Although this represents the best estimate as of today, considering a further increase in life expectancy could be reasonable. The weighted average life expectancy of a currently 65-year-old female plan participant is about 89.3(2022: 89.6) years, and of a currently 65-year-\n\nold male plan participant about 87.4(2022: 86.9) years. An increase in life expectancy by one year would lead to an increase of the defined benefit obligation by € 519 mn (2022: € 493 mn).\n\nThe weighted average values of the assumptions for the Allianz Group's defined benefit plans used to determine the defined benefit obligation and the recognized expenses are as follows:\n\n**Assumptions for defined benefit plans**\n\n| %                                          |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| As of 31 December                          | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Discount rate                              | 3.2  | 3.6  |\n| This includes the following country rates: |      |      |\n| Germany                                    |      |      |\n| long duration                              | 3.2  | 3.7  |\n| short duration                             | 3.2  | 3.7  |\n| United Kingdom                             | 4.5  | 4.8  |\n| Switzerland                                | 1.5  | 1.8  |\n| Rate of compensation increase              | 1.9  | 1.8  |\n| Rate of pension increase                   | 2.2  | 2.2  |\n| Rate of medical cost trend                 | 5.6  | 9.4  |\n\nThe recognized expenses are recorded based on the assumptions of\n\nThe discount rate assumption is the most significant risk for the defined benefit obligation. It reflects market yields at the balance sheet date of high-quality fixed-income investments corresponding to the currency and duration of the liabilities. In the eurozone, the decision for the discount rate is based on AA-rated financial and corporate bonds, and a standardized cash flow profile for a mixed population.\n\nThe range for the sensitivity calculations was derived by analyzing the average volatility over a five-year period.\n\nAn increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points would lead to a decrease of € 1.0 bn (2022: € 1.0 bn) in the defined benefit obligation, whereas a decrease in the discount rate by 50 basis points would lead to an increase of € 1.2 bn (2022: 1.1 bn).\n\nAn increase of pre-retirement benefit assumptions (e.g., a salary increase) of 25 basis points would have an effect of € 42 mn (2022: € 39 mn) on the defined benefit obligation. However, the increase of post-retirement assumptions (e.g., inflation-linked increases of pension payments) of 25 basis points would increase the defined benefit obligation by € 359 mn (2022: € 343 mn).\n\n### **Plan assets/Asset liability management (ALM)**\n\nBased on the estimated future cash flows of € 1,058 mn for 2024, € 989 mn for 2025, € 1,035 mn for 2026, € 1,087 mn for 2027, € 1,109 mn for 2028, and € 5,585 mn for 2029 – 2033, the weighted duration of the defined benefit obligation is 13.9 (2022: 14.0) years. Based on the liability profiles of the defined benefit obligation and on the regulatory funding requirements, the Allianz Group usesstochastic asset liability models to optimize the asset allocation from a risk-return perspective.\n\nDue to a well-diversified portfolio of approximately 132,000 (2022: 129,000) plan participants, no reasonable uncertainty is expected with regard to future cash flows that could affect the liquidity of the Allianz Group.

Plan assets do not include any real estate used by the Allianz Group, and include only € 4.7 mn (2022: € 4.0 mn) of its own transferable financial instruments.\n\nIn addition to the plan assets of € 14.4 bn (2022: € 13.7 bn), the Allianz Group has dedicated assets at Group level amounting to € 8.7 bn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 7.1 bn), which are likewise managed according to Allianz ALM standards.\n\n### **Contributions**\n\nFor the year ending 31 December 2024, the Allianz Group expects to contribute € 235 mn to its defined benefit plans (2022: € 229 mn for the year ending 31 December 2023), and to pay € 486 mn directly to participants in its defined benefit plans (2022: € 431 mn for the year ending 31 December 2023).\n\nthe corresponding previous year.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nDefined contribution plans are funded through independent pension funds or similar organizations. Contributions fixed in advance (e.g., based on salary) are paid to these institutions and the beneficiary's right to benefits exists against the pension fund. The employer has no obligation beyond payment of the contributions.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recognized expenses for defined contribution plans of € 319 mn (2022: € 345 mn). Additionally, the Allianz Group paid contributions for state pension schemes of € 402 mn (2022: € 342 mn).\n\n# 8.17 \\_ Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe AEI plan is granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and is part of the variable compensation component for the plan beneficiaries.\n\nThe RSU granted to a plan participant obligatesthe Allianz Group to pay in cash the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share on the vesting day, or to convert one RSU into one Allianz SE share. The Allianz Group can choose the settlement method for each unit. The payout is capped at a 200 % share price growth above the grant price.\n\nThe RSUs are subject to a contractual vesting period of four years and the payout per RSU is fixed on the last day of the contractual vesting period, which ends on the tenth trading day following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective AEI plan expires.\n\nIn addition, upon the death of a plan participant, a change of control or notice for operational reasons, the RSUs vest immediately and are exercised by the company.\n\nThe RSUs are virtual stocks without dividend payments and with a capped payout. The fair value is calculated by subtracting the net present value of expected future dividend payments until maturity, as well as the fair value of the cap from the prevailing share price as of the valuation date. The cap is valued as a European short call option, using prevailing market data as of the valuation date.\n\nThe following table showsthe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the RSUs at grant date:\n\n#### **Assumptions of AEI plans**\n\n| Year of issue1                                    |   | 20242  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share price                                       | € | 247.32 | 219.06 | 200.99 |\n| Average dividend yield of Allianz SE share        | % | 5.1    | 5.3    | 5.8    |\n| Average interest rate                             | % | 3.0    | 3.3    | (0.3)  |\n| Expected volatility of the Allianz SE share price | % | 18.0   | 20.2   | 21.2   |\n\n1\\_The AEI RSUs are granted as part of the remuneration of the respective prior year. 2\\_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.\n\nThe RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans because the Allianz Group intends to settle in cash. Therefore, the Allianz Group accrues the fair value of the RSUs as compensation expenses over the IFRS vesting period. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recognized compensation expenses related to the AEI plans of € 219 mn (2022: € 113 mn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recorded provisions of € 415 mn (2022: € 326 mn) for these RSUs in other liabilities.\n\nUnder the LTI plan, awards are granted in the form of index-linked restricted stock units (RSUs) which are part of the remuneration policy[1](#page-243-0) for the members of Allianz SE's Board of Management.\n\nRSUs granted to the members of the Board of Management obligate Allianz SE to pay per RSU a cash amount equal to the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share on the last day of the contractual vesting period, multiplied by a performance factor which reflects the total performance of the Allianz stock, relative to the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index during the fouryear contractual vesting period.\n\nThe contractual vesting period ends on the tenth trading day following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective RSU award expires. The payout per RSU is subject to a 200% share price cap relative to the share price at the grant date and a 200% cap applied to the performance factor. In addition, there is a cap <span id=\"page-243-0\"></span>applicable to the total compensation including the LTI payout and various other compensation components.\n\nThe fair value of the index-linked RSUs is calculated as the present value of the expected future payout, taking into account the link between share price performance and relative performance compared to the index, as well as the relevant caps and thresholds as defined in the payout formula. The expected future payout is determined on the basis of observable market data as of the valuation date and market standard simulation techniques.\n\nThe following table shows the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the index-linked RSUs at grant date:\n\n#### **Assumptions of LTI plans**\n\n| Year of issue1                                               | 20242    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Share price                                                  | € 247.32 | 219.06 | 200.99 |\n| Average dividend yield of Allianz SE share                   | % 5.1    | 5.3    | 5.8    |\n| Average interest rate                                        | % 2.3    | 3.2    | 0.0    |\n| Expected volatility of the Allianz SE share price            | % 19.3   | 20.3   | 21.9   |\n| Expected volatility of the index                             | % 17.1   | 16.4   | 18.4   |\n| Expected correlation of the Allianz SE share price and index | % 88.4   | 86.8   | 92.3   |\n\n1\\_The LTI RSUs are granted as part of the remuneration of the respective prior year. 2\\_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.\n\nThe index-linked RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans because the Allianz Group settles in cash.

Participants in the plan are granted options to acquire an own class of equity instruments (M-units), which vest in one-third increments on approximately the third, fourth, and fifth anniversary of the option grant date. Upon vesting, options will automatically be exercised in a cashless transaction, provided they are in the money. Participants may elect to defer the receipt of M-units through the Munit Deferral Plan until termination of their service at the latest. With the M-unit Plan, participants can directly participate in PIMCO's performance. Class M-units are non-voting common equity with limited information rights. They bear quarterly distributions equal to a pro-rata share of PIMCO's net distributable income. Deferred M-units have a right to receive a quarterly cash compensation equal to and in lieu of quarterly dividend payments.\n\nA maximum of 250,000 M-units are authorized for issuance under the M-unit Plan.\n\nAccording to an amendment of the PIMCO LLC Class M-unit Plan, no new M-unit options will be issued after 14 March 2020. Already issued and outstanding M-unit options remain valid and continue as is.\n\nThe fair value of the underlying M-unit options was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Volatility was derived in part by considering the average historical and implied volatility of a selected group of peers. The expected life of one granted option was calculated based on treating the three vesting tranches (one third in years 3, 4, and 5) as three separate awards.\n\nThe number and weighted-average exercise price of the M-unit options outstanding and exercisable are as follows:\n\n### **Reconciliation of outstanding M-unit options**\n\n|                                  | 2023                 |                                          | 2022                 |                                          |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of<br>options | Weighted<br>average<br>exercise<br>price | Number of<br>options | Weighted<br>average<br>exercise<br>price |\n|                                  |                      | €                                        |                      | €                                        |\n| Outstanding as of 1<br>January   | 59,004               | 14,364.26                                | 102,231              | 13,480.70                                |\n| Granted                          | -                    | -                                        | -                    | -                                        |\n| Exercised                        | (31,613)             | 14,299.41                                | (38,379)             | 13,080.42                                |\n| Forfeited                        | (2,666)              | 15,112.58                                | (4,848)              | 15,165.61                                |\n| Outstanding as of 31<br>December | 24,725               | 14,979.42                                | 59,004               | 14,364.26                                |\n| Exercisable as of 31<br>December | -                    | -                                        | -                    | -                                        |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options outstanding was € 121 mn (2022: € 173 mn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the M-unit options outstanding have an exercise price between € 13,140.81 and € 16,119.13, and a weightedaverage remaining contractual life of 0.87 years.\n\nThe share options settled by delivery of PIMCO LLC shares are accounted for as equity-settled plans.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Allianz SE including the non-financial group statement to comply with §§ [Articles] 315b to 315c HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] included in section \"Non-Financial Statement\" for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- − the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023,\n- − the accompanying group management report (excluding the nonfinancial group statement) as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group\n\nmanagement report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development; we do not express an audit opinion on those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report and\n\n− the non-financial group statement included in section \"Non-Financial Statement\" of the group management report is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial group statement included in the group management report.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- ❶ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance\n- ❷ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property-casualty insurance\n- ❸ Measurement of financial instruments using parameters not observable on the market and forward-looking information\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n① Matter and issue\n\n- ② Audit approach and findings\n- ③ Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n### ❶ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance\n\n① In the consolidated financial statements of the Company, liabilities amounting to € 776,944 million (79.0 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported under the \"Insurance contracts liabilities\" balance sheet item, which are accounted for in accordance with \n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\nIFRS 17 beginning 1 January 2023. Of this amount, liabilities of € 680,654 million (69.2 % of the consolidated total assets) are relating to the life and health business segment. Within the life and health business segment, € 671,886 million of this is attributable to the liability, which is measured using the variable fee approach (VFA) or the general measurement model (GMM, also known as the building block approach).\n\nTo the extent that the above-mentioned liabilities are measured using the two measurement models, the measurement is based on complex actuarial methods (hereinafter referred to as the \"measurement methods\") on the basis of comprehensive processes for determining assumptions about future developments of the insurance portfolios to be valued. Within the measurement of the liabilities, the present values of the estimated future cash flows in particular are affected by possible material uncertainties. This uncertainty stems in particular from the methods used and the actuarial assumptions determined in connection with interest rates, investment income, mortality, disability, longevity, costs and policyholder behaviour.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the material significance of the amounts for the group's assets, liabilities and financial performance as well as the complexity of determining the underlying assumptions and estimates made by the executive directors, the measurement of these liabilities was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected controls of the Group for selecting the valuation methods applied as well as for determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued.\n\nWith the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we have compared the valuation methods and key assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods and industry standards and examined to what extent these are suitable for measuring the liabilities. One focus was the assessment of the cash flows used by the IT systems used as well as the appropriate derivation and use of assumptions for the measurement of selected liabilities.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate overall for measuring certain technical liabilities.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health insurance are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and \"Insurance operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### ❷ Measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property-casualty insurance\n\n① In the consolidated financial statements of the Company, liabilities amounting to € 776,944 million (79.0 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported under the balance sheet item \"Insurance contract liabilities\" which are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17 beginning 1 January 2023. Of this amount, liabilities € 96,339 million (9.8 % of the consolidated total assets) is attributable to the Property and Casualty Insurance business segment.\n\nWithin the insurance contracts liabilities, € 79,148 million is attributable to \"Liability for incurred claims\" in the property and casualty insurance segment, which recognises the expectations regarding insurance claims that have been incurred but not yet settled. These represent the company's expectation of future payments for known and unknown claims as well as the associated expenses. The company uses various methods to estimate these obligations. In addition, the measurement of this liability requires a significant degree of judgement by the executive directors of the Company regarding assumptions to be made, such as the impact of changing inflation rates, loss developments and regulatory changes. In addition, there is a significant judgement of the executive directors regarding the determination of the discount rate for calculating the liability. In particular, product lines with a low claims frequency, high individual claims or long claims settlement periods are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties.\n\nDue to the material significance of the amount of this liability for the Group's assets, liabilities, and financial performance as well as the considerable scope for judgement of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in property and casualty insurance was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected controls of the Group for selecting actuarial methods as well as for determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued in the property and casualty insurance.\n\nWith the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods and key assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods and industry standards and examined to what extent these are suitable for measuring the liabilities. Our audit also included an evaluation of the appropriateness and integrity of the data and assumptions, including the assessment of the executive directors regarding the impact of changing inflation rates, used in the valuation and a reconstruction of the claims settlement process. Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the liability for selected lines of product, in particular lines of product with large liability amounts or increased estimation uncertainties. For these lines of product, we compared the amounts calculated by us with the values determined by the Company for the liabilities and evaluated any differences. We also examined whether any adjustments to estimates in the loss reserves were adequately documented and substantiated.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate overall for measuring the technical liabilities in property and casualty insurance.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of liabilities for outstanding claims in property and casualty insurance are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and on \"Insurance operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### ❸ Measurement of financial instruments using parameters not observable on the market and forward-looking information\n\n① Financial instruments of € 721,802 million (73.4 % of the consolidated total assets) are reported in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\nOf these financial instruments, financial assets totalling € 704,390 million are measured at fair value, of which in turn the fair values of € 220.967 million are calculated using valuation models or based on third-party value indicators. These financial instruments in particular relate to unlisted securities, other loans, \n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\nderivatives and investments in infrastructure, private equity and real estate.\n\nOf the financial instruments reported in the consolidated financial statements, financial assets in the amount of € 8,829 million are measured at amortised cost and € 562,693million at fair value through other comprehensive income. Of this amount, € 543,510 million is attributable to debt instruments for which a risk provision totalling € 1,125 million was recognised as at the reporting date to take account of impairments for expected credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 (Expected Credit Loss), as applicable since 1 January 2023.\n\nThe measurement of financial instruments whose fair value must be determined using valuation models or value indicators from third parties is subject to uncertainty, as input parameters that are not observable in an active market are used for the measurement or comparative values are not always available and therefore estimated values are also used. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are also included in the model valuation to take account of impairments for expected credit losses.\n\nModel-measured financial instruments are subject to an increased measurement risk due to the reduced objectivity and the underlying judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors. As the estimates and assumptions used, in particular those relating to interest rates and cash flows, and the valuation methods applied may have a material impact on the valuation of these financial instruments and on the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance, and extensive disclosures on valuation methods and judgements are also required in the notes, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls for the valuation of model-measured financial instruments and financial instruments measured on the basis of third-party indicators. In addition, we assessed, among other things, the integrity of the underlying data and the process for determining the assumptions, estimates and forward-looking information used in the valuation.\n\nWith the support of our internal valuation specialists, we also assessed the appropriateness of the methods applied by the executive directors to determine the fair values and the parameters used. We compared the methods and assumptions used to calculate valuation adjustments in the financial year with recognised practices and industry standards and examined the extent to which they are suitable for proper accounting. To assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of impairment for expected credit losses, we involved internal specialists with particular expertise in the field of credit risk modelling. We also evaluated the disclosures on valuation methods and judgements contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn the basis of the audit procedures performed, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and assumptions used by the executive directors to measure certain financial instruments (modelled and measured based on third-party indicators) and the consideration of forward-looking information in determining the impairment for expected credit losses are appropriate overall and that the explanations and disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.\n\n③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of financial instruments are contained in sections \"Accounting policies\" and \"Investments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\n- − the group statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 315d HGB included in section \"Corporate Governance Statement\" of the group management report\n- − the disclosures marked as unaudited in the group management report\n\n#### The other information comprises further\n\n- − the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- − all remaining parts of the group annual report excluding crossreferences to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial group statement included in the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- − is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- − otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and \n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a nonfinancial group statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial group statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and terms in section \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial group statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, of the group management report as well as of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, and whether the non-financial group statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements and with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Company's executive directors, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the nonfinancial group statement.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- − Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- − Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report and of the non-financial group statement included in the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- − Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- − Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- − Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- − Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- − Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- − Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- − Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial group statement as a whole. As\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\nexplained in the description of the responsibilities of the executive directors, the executive directors have interpreted the wording and terms contained in the relevant regulations; the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to inherent uncertainties mentioned in this description. Those inherent uncertainties in the interpretation apply to our audit accordingly.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\nReport on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file Allianz SE\\_KA+KLB\\_ESEF-2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering, of Financial Statements and Management Reports, Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. [number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n− Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n\n- − Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- − Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- − Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n- − Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machinereadable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 4 May 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 11 May 2023. We have been the group auditor of the Allianz SE, Munich, without interruption since the financial year 2018.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group \n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\nmanagement report and do not take their place.

January to 31. December 2023 including the related disclosures, which was prepared to comply with § [Article] 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act].\n\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Allianz SE are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of § 162 AktG. The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of § 162 AktG.\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by § 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by § 162 Abs. 1 and 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Allianz SE. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement. § 334 BGB [Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 26 February 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\n| Florian Möller          | Dennis Schnittger       |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Wirtschaftsprüfer       | Wirtschaftsprüfer       |\n| (German Public Auditor) | (German Public Auditor) |\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Allianz Sustainability Report 2023**\n\nImage /page/269/Picture/2 description: The image is a book cover with the Allianz logo in the upper left corner.
