KGaA business group (hereinafter CEWE) complies with the duty to disclose non-financial information for the financial year 2023 in accordance with Secs. 315b and 315c HGB in conjunction with Secs. 289c to 289e HGB. The separate consolidated non-financial report has been consolidated with the separate consolidated non-financial report of the parent company in accordance with Sec. 289b HGB. It is incorporated into the annual report and refers to the GRI Standards (Sec. 289d HGB) as its framework. The separate consolidated nonfinancial report was reviewed and released by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board assessed the separate consolidated non-financial report for its legality, reliability and appropriateness.\n\n#### **Business model**\n\nCEWE is active in three strategic business units: Photofinishing, Commercial Online Printing and Retail. The locations and distribution offices are spread to 26 countries across Europe. Buyers and recipients include retail stores, consumers and trade professionals. The mandatory information pertaining to the business model are detailed in this annual report from **[page 52 f.](#page-53-0)** onwards.\n\n#### **Relevance of sustainability**\n\nSustainability has been enshrined within the Board of Management since 2008 and has been governed by Thomas Mehls since 2016, who oversees Sustainability, Marketing and New Business Units on the Board of Management. He governs sustainability together with two area managers and in co-ordination with the Sustainability Task Force **[Sustainability](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [Report 2023, page 17](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. CEWE greatly values sustainable governance across all sectors and has included all areas in its sustainability activities **[Sustainability Report 2023, pages 17 and](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [21 f.](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)** Sustainability management thus forms an integral part of corporate governance within the organisation. The strategy is rooted in five dimensions: honest and fair conduct, economic viability, environmental protection and resource conservation, responsibility for employees and social commitment **[Sustainability Report 2023, page 17](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**.\n\n#### **Process to establish material non-financial topics according to the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)**\n\nWhen assessing aspects that concern the separate consolidated non-financial report, CEWE was guided by the material topics of sustainability in accordance with the 2020 version of the materiality analysis. **[Sustainability Report 2023 pages 21 f.](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)** CEWE conducted a comprehensive stakeholder survey in 2020 for this, which once again serves as the basis for this year's separate consolidated non-financial report **[Sustainability Report 2023 page 21](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. The aspects were reviewed once again in preparation of this report with regard to the materiality requirements under the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). Comments from the auditing process of the previous reporting year were consulted. It was explored whether the details are necessary to understand the business performance, the business result, the company's position as well as the understanding of the impact of the company's activities on non-financial aspects.\n\nAn internal review has established that the current material topics continue to be relevant for CEWE. These are currently being further specified as part of the adjustments to the double materiality in accordance with the future requirements of the ESRS. In conclusion, the strategic priorities from the materiality matrix were attributed to concerns according to CSR-RUG, notably Climate Protection as well as Materials and Waste (Environmental), Responsible Use of Technology (Social) and Sustainable Products (Products). Moreover, the following topics from the materiality matrix were attributed to concerns which the CSR-RUG rates as material: Good Employer (Employee Rights), Sustainable Supply Chain (Human Rights), Fair Working Practices (Anti-Corruption and Bribery). Other topics from the materiality matrix were not deemed to be material according to CSR-RUG.\n\nCEWE plans to conduct new stakeholder surveys at regular intervals to establish if the defined topics remain relevant. A new stakeholder survey was originally planned for 2023. However, due to the changed legal situation for the 2024 report, this was postponed in order to implement the adjustment to the double materiality analysis in accordance with the CSRD.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe outcome from the risk assessment is summarised on **[pages 37 and 38 of the Sustainability](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [Report](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. In line with Secs. 289c (3), 3 and 4 and 315c (2) HGB, no material risks were identified, neither in relation to its own business activities or its business relationships, nor for products and services in terms of non-financial aspects under review, which most likely have or would have serious negative impacts on these aspects.\n\n#### **Reporting in accordance with EU taxonomy**\n\nThe European Green Deal is a concept developed by the European Commission with the overarching aim of transitioning towards a competitive, resource-efficient and climate-neutral European economy. To achieve this goal, different actions have been defined for such areas as energy supply, traffic, trade, industry, agriculture and forestry as well as financial market regulation.\n\nOne element of the European Green Deal includes the objective of the EU taxonomy, which furthers sustainable investments by designing a common classification system on what environmentally sustainable economic activities across all sectors are. The respective mandatory reporting which was launched for capital market-guided enterprises is to give users the transparent and uniform possibility to compare the sustainability of business models.\n\nArticle 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation specifies six environmental objectives of the European Union:\n\n- Climate change mitigation\n- Climate change adaptation\n- The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- The transition to a circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control\n- The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nFor the financial year 2021, the disclosure focused initially on the first two objectives only due to the facilitation granted by the EU, i.e., Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation, regarding the proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the overall turnover as well as in capital expenditures and operational expenses. Since this facilitation option has been dropped for the financial year 2022, the reporting covered not only taxonomy eligibility, but also examined taxonomy alignment. Due to the Environmental Delegated Act, reporting for the 2023 financial year is required on all six environmental objectives. In accordance with the facilitation granted for the 2021 financial year, the disclosure obligations for the 2023 financial year with regard to the four new environmental objectives \"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\", \"Transition to a circular economy\", \"Pollution prevention and control\" and \"Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\" also only include the assessments of possible taxonomy eligibility in each case.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities include those established and described in the Climate/Environmental Delegated Act as they are relevant for the environmental objectives named. Moreover, identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities are considered to be taxonomy aligned if they meet the so-called technical screening criteria, which are fundamentally composed of two components: (1) substantial contribution towards one of the named environmental objectives; and (2) do no harm to other environmental objectives.\n\nFurthermore, it must be ensured that minimum social safeguards are met (in accordance with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO core labour standards and the International Bill of Human Rights).\n\ncewe group\n\nements 6 Fur\n\n→ Separate consolidated non-financial report\n\n**Risk assessment**\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\nnon-financial report\n\nThe individual key indicators are established by applying the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are used for the consolidated financial statements and take all fully consolidated Group companies into consideration. The overall turnover concurs with the value shown in the profit and loss account for the financial year concerned. Overall capital expenditures are defined as the sum of gross additions to the tangible and intangible fixed assets during the year under review without goodwill acquired. Overall operational expenses encompass all direct, non-capitalised costs connected to research & development, renovation measures, short-term leases as well as upkeep and maintenance or repair. For calculation of the figures, the financial indicators turnover, operational expenses (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX) were analysed regarding their taxonomy eligibility. Data from the annual report and the consolidation system were evaluated in order to identify the proportion of turnover, as well as capital expenditures and operational expenses, that can be attributable to taxonomy-eligible economic activities. The individual items are clearly allocated to the respective category and environmental objectives so that nothing was counted twice.\n\nThe following information reflects CEWE's own assessment. The legislative acts published so far on the Taxonomy Regulation only contain activities of particular relevance to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, and no activities for the other four environmental objectives. For the CEWE Group, no turnover-relevant economic activities have been classified according to the current status of the regulations and no turnover could be established that is eligible under the taxonomy. Depending on the specific content of the Regulation, however, taxonomy-compliant revenues could be determined for the CEWE Group for the next financial years.\n\nThe analysis of economic activities regarding capital expenditure has shown that investments are being made in taxonomy-eligible economic activities relating to the purchase of products and services named under Annex I (Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation) of the delegated act. This refers mainly to bicycle traffic and the vehicle fleet (Activities 6.4 and 6.5) as well as measures for renewable energy (Activity 7.6).\n\nFurthermore, operational expenses have been identified that relate to the purchase of products and services from taxonomy-eligible economic activity as named under Annex I (Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation) of the delegated regulation. These particularly include expenses for bicycle traffic and the vehicle fleet (Activities 6.4 and 6.5).\n\nThe analysis of taxonomy-eligible economic activities regarding their conformity has shown that the responses are not sufficient to draw the conclusion that the necessary requirements could be regarded as fulfilled.\n\nThere are no activities pursuant to Delegated Regulation 2022/1214 regarding nuclear energy and fossil gas.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Separate consolidated non-financial report\n\n**CAPEX**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                 |             |                    |                                     |                                          |                                          | Criteria for a substantial contribution   |                       |                              |                                             |                                   |                                   |                                    |                | DNSH criteria         |                                     |                         |                                                                                                  |                                        |                                            |  |  |  |  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|\n| Economic activity (1)                                                                                                                           | Code(s) (2) | CapEx (3)<br>[EUR] | CapEx-Anteil, Jahr 2023 (4)<br>in % | Climate change<br>mitigation (5)<br>as % | Climate change<br>adaptation (6)<br>as % | Water and marine<br>resources (7)<br>as % | Pollution (8)<br>as % | Circular economy (9)<br>in % | Biodiversity and<br>ecosystems (10)<br>as % | Climate change<br>mitigation (11) | Climate change<br>adaptation (12) | Water and marine<br>resources (13) | Pollution (14) | Circular economy (15) | Biodiversity and<br>ecosystems (16) | Minimum safeguards (17) | Share of taxonomy-aligned<br>(A.1.) or taxonomy-eligible<br>(A.2.)

Assurance Engagement of the Combined Non-Financial Report **1**\n\n### To CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined non-financial report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, (hereinafter referred to as CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA or the Company), including the parts qualified by references as components for the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the \"combined non-financial report\") to obtain limited assurance.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Executive Directors**\n\nThe executive directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the combined non-financial report in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB [\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report.\n\nThis responsibility of the executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### **Independence and Quality Management of the Assurance Practitioner's Firm**\n\nWe have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements in particular the By-laws Regulating the Rights and Duties of Wirtschaftsprüfer and vereidigte Buchprüfer in the exercise of their Profession as well as the IDW Quality Management Standards issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW), and\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined non-financial report and issued an Independent Practitioner's Report in German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the original German Independent Practitioner's Report.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\naccordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n#### **Practitioner's Responsibility**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial report based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the group's combined non-financial financial report of the Company for the period of January 1st to December 31st, 2023 with the exception of the external sources of documentation or expert opinions in the combined non-financial financial report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report. This does not mean that a separate audit opinion is expressed on each of the disclosures.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities, particularly:\n\n- Obtainment of an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the employees responsible for the materiality analysis in order to gain an understanding of the procedure for identifying material topics and corresponding reporting boundaries of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n- A risk assessment, including a media analysis, of relevant information about CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's sustainability performance during the reporting period\n- Assessment of the suitability of internally developed definitions\n- Analytical assessment of selected quantitative data\n- Inquiries of personnel responsible for determining the disclosures relating to concepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control procedures and consolidating the disclosures\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents\n- Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-aligned activities and the corresponding disclosures in the combined non-financial report\n- Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n206\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### **Assurance Opinion**\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the combined non-financial report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors as disclosed in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report.\n\n#### **Restriction of Use**\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the parent company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the parent company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.\n\n## **General Engagement Terms**\n\nThis engagement is based on the \"Special Engagement Terms and Conditions of BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\" of March 1st, 2021, agreed with the Company as well as the \"General Engagement Terms and Conditions for Auditors and Auditing Firms\" of January 1st, 2017, issued by the IDW ( **[www.bdo.de/de-de/auftragsbedingungen](https://www.bdo.de/en-gb/engagement-terms-conditions)**).\n\nMunich, March 19th, 2024\n\nBDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nThorben Kunze Carmen Auer Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\ncewe group\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n6 Further Information\n\n→ Financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Or, as we like to say here at CEWE: \"We are not entirely dissatisfied.\"\n\n#### **All of our business units have contributed to this success**\n\nIn our main business unit, Photofinishing, turnover increased by 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros and thus enabled EBIT growth of 8.6 % to 80.0 million euros. It is notable that the CEWE Group once again achieved an increase in earnings in its critical Christmas business. All of our brands have contributed to this positive trend: CEWE of course, but also Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and WhiteWall. They are all integral components of our innovative photofinishing product range. Turnover also increased in CEWE's second-largest business unit, Commercial Online Printing, by 6.6 %. Earnings rose by 81 % to 4.2 million euros. This means that not only has this business unit returned to the black, it has also delivered a highly respectable EBIT margin for this business unit of 4.5 %.\n\nImage /page/2/Picture/14 description: A portrait shot of a middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.

The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting.\n\nYvonne Rostock Chairwoman of the Board of Management\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ The Board of Management\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>2</sup>\n\n# The Board of Management\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/6 description: A group of seven people are standing together in a well-lit indoor setting. The group consists of four men and three women, all dressed in business attire. The men are wearing suits, while the women are wearing a combination of suits and blouses.

In 2023, once again this success didn't materialise all on its own – it reflects the effort made by the employees of the CEWE Group, who really \"put their back into it\". This is the only reason we are now seeing these presentable results. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to them!\n\n#### **This marks the continuation of a long, successful track record**\n\nWe are particularly pleased that many of these figures represent the continuation of long, successful track records. Leaving aside the pandemic-related upswing in 2020, since 2012 our EBIT figure has climbed in nice steady increments from 28.3 million euros to the above-mentioned 83.9 million euros in the past financial year. CEWE doesn't optimise things for a single year, and still less for a single quarter. CEWE is a long-distance runner and thinks in terms of long development cycles spanning a period of decades.\n\n#### **15th consecutive dividend increase planned**\n\nThe same is true of the company's dividend. As you will have gathered from our annual report, over a period of many years now, our avowed dividend policy is to achieve continuous growth in our dividend per share if the company's results permit this. We are naturally able to compensate for minor operational fluctuations in our results. We are therefore pleased to be able to present you with a proposal for a further dividend increase to 2.60 euros per share at our general meeting, which will be held on June 5, 2024. Should you support our proposal, this would represent our 15th consecutive dividend increase. In this case, CEWE would remain one of the top three listed companies in Germany with the most consecutive dividend increases up to the present day. We are delighted with this and are pleased to be continuing on this path with you.\n\nDear shareholders, make the most of the spring! Use the time for trips and travel and take plenty of photos along the way. Your company is ready to help if you would like to turn these photos into CEWE Group photo products.\n\nFor us this naturally means, as a German football manager once remarked, \"after the match is before the match\". Or more precisely: after Christmas is before Christmas. Your company had a very successful Christmas 2023 and is now building on this momentum as it prepares for the next peak season: Christmas 2024. We are already laying the foundations for the innovations we will be introducing over the course of the year, which will be available to you and our customers by Christmas at the latest.\n\nOn behalf of CEWE's Board of Management\n\nYvonne Rostoch\n\nYvonne Rostock\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>→ The CEWE Group\n\n\\$\\bigcirc\\$ < 4 >\n\n# The CEWE Group\n\nEurope's leading photo service and online printing provider\n\nThe CEWE Group is Europe's leading photo service and online printing provider.\n\nFrom its beginnings in 1912, CEWE has established itself as the first choice as a photo service for anyone looking to make more of their photos. The company's CEWE PHOTO-BOOK in particular stands for this, with multiple awards and around six million copies sold every year. Customers can obtain further personalised photo products through the brands CEWE, Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and White-Wall, for instance – and from many leading European retailers. These brand worlds inspire customers to produce a wide range of creative designs with their personal photos, and customers entrust the company with over 2 billion photos every year.\n\nIn addition, for the online printing market the CEWE Group has established a highly efficient production system for printed advertising media and business stationery. Billions of high-quality printing products reliably reach their customers via the distribution platforms SAXOPRINT, LASERLINE and viaprinto every year.\n\nThe CEWE Group is committed to a sustainable corporate management philosophy which is also supported by the Neumüllers, the company's founding family, and has been recognised with multiple awards: a long-term business focus; fair, partnership-based relationships with customers, employees and suppliers; and assuming social responsibility while pursuing an environmentally friendly approach and conserving resources.\n\nThe CEWE Group is present in 21 countries with 4,000 employees. The CEWE share is listed in the SDAX index.

The decade of the analogue/digital transformation follows from 2000 onwards: digital cameras become a mass market phenomenon and CEWE consolidates its market leadership in the digital photofinishing segment by making early adjustments to its production technology, its marketing activities and its product range and by developing the CEWE PHOTOBOOK brand. From 2010, CEWE achieved growth above all thanks to the consistent ongoing development and expansion of its Photofinishing core business unit. It also developed a new business unit, Commercial Online Printing, in this period.**\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n> Alongside Photofinishing, CEWE currently has around 100 of its own photo retail stores and directly markets photofinishing products in particular via this distribution channel. Besides this main activity which is reported in the Photofinishing business unit, CEWE's retail operations also generate earnings from photo hardware (cameras, lenses etc.) which are separately reported in the Retail business unit.\n\nOn the basis of the digital print capabilities which have been developed in its Photofinishing business unit through this process of transformation and by acquiring expertise in online offset printing, from 2009/2010 CEWE then turned its Commercial Online Printing business unit into a modern online printing service for business stationery. This additional business unit achieved rapid growth in subsequent years to reach a turnover volume of around 100 million euros.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the coronavirus pandemic had a particularly pronounced impact on the demand trend and the development of turnover in all of CEWE's business units: the \"stay-at-home\" effect back then had an especially positive effect on sales of photo products in Photofinishing, while the coronavirus restrictions and shuttering of businesses adversely affected the level of demand in the Commercial Online Printing and Retail business units. 2022 was shaped by things continuing to get back to normal in the context of coronavirus; above all, people increasingly travelled again, which also meant new photos. The recovery of business life also led to a significant rise in the level of demand for printed advertising media. Now that the coronavirus pandemic had been fully overcome, people once again travelled a great deal in 2023: the strong level of holiday travel led consumers to take a lot of new photos.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\ne 2. Combined Management Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nCEWE was able to convert this into its own business growth, thanks to the positioning of its brands as well as its marketing activities. In the financial year 2023 which has just ended, turnover reported according to the IFRS once again registered strong growth to 780.2 million euros: an increase of 47.5 million euros or 6.5 % (2022: 732.7 million euros). Including the turnover of futalis which was sold in late December and thus removed from the profit and loss account in accordance with IFRS 5, Group turnover thus calculated even increased to 788.8 million euros (Group turnover in 2022 incl. futalis: 741.0 million euros). For 2023, CEWE had envisaged Group turnover in a target range of between 720 and 780 million euros.\n\nA change in the product mix already occurred during the analogue/digital transformation in the Photofinishing core business unit, and to some extent this continues right up to the present day: at the start of the digitalisation\n\n# **780.2 million euros**\n\n#### Turnover volume in 2023\n\nprocess, consumers continued to request individual photo prints. While they had previously done so for analogue film, they now did so for digital image formats. With these digital product innovations, demand then shifted away from these simple (low-margin) photo prints to highermargin \"added-value products\" such as CEWE PHOTO-BOOK, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and many other photo gifts. Above all, this change in the Photofinishing product mix resulted in a constantly rising\n\n**Long-term development of turnover EBIT development** (EBIT in millions of euros)\n\n- Strong EBIT in 2023: at 83.9 million euros, CEWE achieves the highest earnings figure in the company's history\n- CEWE successfully converts a heightened level of holiday travel in 2023 – leading consumers to take a lot of new photos – into its own business growth\n- The Commercial Online Printing and Retail business units clearly improve and also make a positive contribution to Group EBIT\n\nImage /page/14/Figure/16 description: The image is a stacked bar chart showing the growth of different types of photofinishing from 1990 to 2022.

In late December 2023, CEWE sold futalis – which had previously been reported in the \"Other Activities\" business unit – as announced. Including futalis, the operating earnings (EBIT) of the CEWE Group thus calculated increased to 81.6 million euros in 2023 (2022: 75.6 million euros). For 2023, CEWE had envisaged an EBIT figure of between 70 and 82 million euros.\n\n**83.9**\n\nmillion euros EBIT in 2023\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/10 description: The image shows the word \"cewe\" in white, handwritten-style font against a red rectangular background.

In 2023, the usual seasonal nature of business once again loomed large in terms of consumers' placement of orders: the first quarter picks up, the second and third quarters are somewhat flat or even register a slight decline, while the fourth quarter with the key Christmas business season is then generally stronger. The simple explanation for this is that in the spring and the summer, when the weather is nice, people spend a lot of time traveling and attending parties and events – this time of the year offers a good deal of opportunities to take a lot of new photos. During the six months of the year when the weather is less good, many people then spend more time at home and place orders for photo products – and naturally do so particularly often when it comes to choosing gifts for Christmas. In the past financial year 2023, a CEWE PHOTOBOOK, a photo calendar, wall art and many other personal photo gifts once again served as permanent mementos of a wide range of experiences.\n\n#### **Further growth in volume of photos and CEWE PHOTOBOOK sales**\n\nPhoto products especially have a very high emotional value for many people and demand for them is increasing, largely independently of the overall economic trend. In the past financial year, due to factors including the strong positioning of its brands and its marketing activities CEWE has thus above all successfully converted the resurgence\n\nof holiday travel in 2023 – which led consumers to take a large number of new photos – into its own business growth: the total number of photos across the entire CEWE product range increased by + 4.8 % in the year under review to 2.39 billion photos (2022: 2.28 billion photos). It thus reached a level at the upper end of the target range envisaged for 2023 of between 2.2 and 2.3 billion photos, or even slightly exceeded this. CEWE PHOTOBOOK also developed positively, with growth of 3.4 % to a sales volume of 6.1 million CEWE PHOTOBOOKS (2022: 5.8 million PHOTO-BOOKS) and also exceeded its target for 2023 of up to 6.0 million PHOTOBOOKS. CEWE has thus produced over 86 million CEWE PHOTOBOOKS for its customers since 2005: CEWE PHOTOBOOK remains Europe's most popular photo book.\n\n#### **Photofinishing turnover rises by 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros**\n\nIn Photofinishing, 2023 started out with a very strong Q1 and turnover growth of + 12.0 %. This was followed by Q2 and Q3, with turnover increases of + 9.0 % and + 7.1 % respectively, while the fourth quarter achieved further growth of + 4.1 %, relative to the high level in the previous year. In overall terms, in the year 2023 as a whole Photofinishing turnover thus increased by a strong + 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros: growth of 42.7 million euros (Photofinishing turnover 2022: 616.1 million euros). On the one hand, customers have increased their orders of photo products. On the other hand, the price increases implemented for almost all product groups are supporting this turnover growth. These price increases were necessary in order to compensate for inflation-driven higher costs affecting virtually all of the P&L items, such as the cost of sales, personnel expenses and other operating expenses (including logistics and energy costs).\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/14 description: The image shows a blue outline of a camera icon.

As in every year, in 2023 CEWE once again realised most of its annual profits in the fourth calendar quarter. Thanks to strong economies of scale in CEWE's production operations, which operated at full capacity during the Christmas business season, this high earnings share in the fourth quarter is entirely typical. With a weaker level of capacity utilisation and due to the high residual fixed costs, Q1, Q2 and Q3 generally only provide a lower share of earnings.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 also gained ground, considered in isolation: following an EBIT figure of 74.6 million euros in Q4 in the previous year, in the quarter under review EBIT improved by 3.6 million euros to 78.2 million euros.\n\n> The Christmas business season once again gathers steam, providing Photofinishing with a strong result for the year: EBIT of 80.0 million euros in 2023.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, one-off factors accounted for a total of approx. – 4.0 million euros due to amortisation on the purchase price allocations for Cheerz (– 0.9 million euros), WhiteWall (– 2.1 million euros) and Hertz (0.5 million euros) as well as a writedown on software licences no longer required (– 0.5 million euros). In the previous year, 2022, a combined figure of – 4.2 million euros was recognised as extraordinary expenses, for amortisation on purchase price allocations (Cheerz – 1.7 million euros, WhiteWall – 2.1 million euros and Hertz – 0.4 million euros). Adjusted for these one-off factors, the operating EBIT figure for the Photofinishing business unit reached a level of 84.0 million euros in the financial year 2023 (adjusted operating EBIT in 2022: 77.9 million euros).\n\n#### **Photofinishing's operating EBIT margin registers further slight increase and reaches a strong 12.8 %**\n\nIn 2023, the operating earnings margin (before the extraordinary expenses described above) in the Photofinishing core business unit maintains the trend of a continuous long-term increase in profitability: following\n\n# **12.8 %**\n\noperating EBIT margin for Photofinishing in 2023\n\n12.7 % in 2022, Photofinishing's EBIT margin amounted to 12.8 % and thus once again increased slightly. Over the past few years, the ongoing change in the product mix and the additional contribution margins arising from the longterm increase in turnover have resulted in a steady rise in the operating EBIT margin in the Photofinishing business unit. The year 2020 provided particularly impressive proof of the sort of margin which is possible with corresponding volume growth: the strong, coronavirus-shaped increase in demand caused CEWE's operating EBIT margin to temporarily jump to an extraordinarily high 15.1 %.\n\n> Following 12.7 % in 2022, in 2023 Photofinishing's EBIT margin was once again at a strong level and registered a further slight increase to 12.8 %.\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/18 description: This bar chart shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Combined Management Report\n\nent Report 4 Remuneration\n\n# Retail business unit\n\nCEWE operates multichannel retailing in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Norway and Sweden in the form of retail outlets and online shops. CEWE RETAIL clearly focuses on generating photofinishing business, i.e. the marketing of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS, calendars, greeting cards, wall art and other photo gifts. The turnover and earnings contribution provided by this photofinishing product range is reported in the Photofinishing business unit. The Retail business unit only reports turnover and earnings from photo hardware business generated e.g. with cameras and photo accessories. In future, CEWE will continue to develop this merchandise business with optimal margins, while deliberately avoiding unprofitable turnover.\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n**Retail turnover** in millions of euros /  change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar chart that shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The value for 2019 is 43.7 with a -10.3% change. The value for 2020 is 34.1 with a -21.8% change. The value for 2021 is 31.2 with a -8.7% change. The value for 2022 is 32.4 with a +3.9% change. The value for 2023 is 31.1 with a -3.4% change.\n\n#### **Retail realises turnover volume of 31.3 million euros in 2023**\n\nWith its 100 or so branches in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern Europe, hardware retail achieved an annual turnover volume of 31.3 million euros in 2023 (2022: 32.4 million euros; – 3.4 %). Adjusted for currency effects, this turnover even increased slightly by 1.4 %. For Retail, too, the fourth quarter with the Christmas business season and a turnover share in excess of 30 % is the most important quarter of the year: following 10.2 million euros of Q4 turnover last year, in the quarter under review which has now ended CEWE Retail achieved a turnover volume of 9.5 million euros (–7.1%). Adjusted for currency effects, hardware retail achieved a Q4 turnover volume which was 3.0 % weaker.\n\nIn its Retail business unit, CEWE is continuing to focus on its business with photofinishing products (which is reported in its Photofinishing business unit) and uses its retail activities as a B2C sales channel for CEWE PHOTO-BOOK, photo calendars, wall art and many other photo products.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/13 description: The image contains a block of text that reads: \"Through its deliberate abandonment of low-margin photo hardware business and its focus on photo-finishing products, CEWER has been actively reducing its photo hardware turnover for some years now.\"\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/14 description: The image shows a blue icon of two people, a man and a woman. The man is on the left and the woman is on the right. They are both facing forward and have simple, stylized features. The man has short hair and the woman has longer hair that falls to her shoulders.\n\n- At 31.3 million euros, in line with CEWE's strategy turnover with photo hardware and accessories in 2023 was slightly lower than in the previous year (2022: 32.4 million euros)\n- Retail remains well positioned and improved its EBIT by a significant 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros (2022: 0.2 million euros), despite a slight decrease in turnover\n\n**100**\n\nretail branches focusing on sales of photofinishing products\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/19 description: The image is a graphic design featuring a pattern of blue dots on a light gray background.

The y-axis shows the Retail EBIT in millions of euros. In 2019, the Retail EBIT was 0.0. In 2020, the Retail EBIT was -4.2, a change of -36.4%. In 2021, the Retail EBIT was 0.2. In 2022, the Retail EBIT was 0.2. In 2023, the Retail EBIT was 0.5, a change of +179%. Next to the bar chart is a text box that says \"Retail remains well positioned in 2023: despite the slight decrease in turnover, its EBIT figure improves by a significant 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros.\"\n\nIn the photo hardware segment (cameras and accessories), CEWE is continuing to deliberately make do without low-margin retail business. In previous years, the active reduction in turnover in the Retail business unit was normally around – 10 %.\n\n#### **Hardware retail improves EBIT figure despite slight decline in turnover**\n\nThe earnings trend reflects Retail's strong position: despite the slight fall in turnover, in 2023 the Retail business unit strongly improved its contribution to Group EBIT, by 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros (2022: 0.2 million euros). In view of typically relatively low merchandise margins, this is a top-rate performance. In the first year of the pandemic, 2020, CEWE had already resolved to close overall slightly more than 40 branches in all of the countries where CEWE's Retail business unit operates. CEWE Retail continued to benefit from this accelerated optimisation of its branch structure in the financial year 2023 now ended.\n\nIn the Retail business unit too, Christmas business – and thus the fourth quarter – plays a key role in the earnings trend for the year as a whole. With a Q4 EBIT figure of 0.9 million euros which was achieved above all in December, during the Christmas business season, the earnings shortfall up to the end of the third quarter was once again fully made up for in the past year, and Retail made a positive contribution to Group earnings (EBIT Q4 2022: 0.7 million euros).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\ns 3 Combined Management Report\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n- With its \"best-price guarantee\" for its customers, Commercial Online Printing increases its turnover by + 6.6 % to 92.2 million euros (2022: 86.5 million euros)\n- Optimised cost structure provides further sustained improvement in income situation, COP increases its EBIT to 4.2 million euros (2022: 2.3 million euros) and achieves an EBIT margin of 4.5 %\n\n**+ 6.6 %**\n\nturnover growth in Commercial Online Printing in 2023\n\nchange on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/12 description: The image shows a pattern of blue dots on a light gray background.

The overall effect is a dynamic and abstract design.\n\n# Commercial Online Printing business unit\n\nWith its online printing brands SAXOPRINT, viaprinto and LASERLINE, CEWE is ideally positioned on the European market for printed advertising media and business stationery ordered online and has a particularly strong presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (the \"DACH\" region): SAXOPRINT serves customers primarily in the offset printing segment, in Germany and in the Group's other international markets, and offers a best-price guarantee; viaprinto is primarily positioned in the digital printing segment as a provider of high-quality printed products with small print runs; LASERLINE has a particularly strong presence in Berlin and Brandenburg and serves customers based in this region.\n\n**Commercial Online Printing achieves further growth in 2023**\n\nIn the year under review 2023 now ended, with its \"bestprice guarantee\" for its customers Commercial Online Printing once again achieved an increase in turnover: at\n\n**Commercial Online Printing turnover** in millions of euros /  change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/18 description: The image is a bar chart that shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The turnover contribution provided by the fourth quarter amounted to 25.9 million euros (turnover in Q4 2022: 26.5 million euros). This \"best-price guarantee\" stands for the promise that SAXOPRINT's printing products will always be offered at the lowest price on the market. Should a SAXOPRINT customer find that a similar product is available from competitors at a lower price, SAXOPRINT will reimburse the price difference. This best-price guarantee is made possible by the level of cost efficiency achieved in SAXOPRINT's production operations: SAXOPRINT's highly automated production plant is considered one of the most modern technology parks for online offset printing in Europe. In order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. **Retail EBIT** in millions of euros / **Commercial Online Printing EBIT** in millions of euros / \n\n> With the \"best-price guarantee\" which it offers its customers, Commercial Online Printing achieves further growth in the    financial year 2023: + 6.6 % increase in turnover.\n\nchange on previous year as %\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n2 Combined Management Report\n\nent Report 4. Remuneration\n\ntion\n\n#### **COP earnings significantly increased to 4.2 million euros**\n\nWhile it is still some way off its pre-pandemic turnover volume seen in 2019 (103.2 million euros), Commercial Online Printing has improved its EBIT contribution to Group earnings by 1.9 million euros to 4.2 million euros and has thus once again achieved a strong improvement by comparison with the level which it realised in the previous year (COP EBIT 2022: 2.3 million euros). With an optimised cost structure, the Commercial Online Printing business unit has thus once again achieved its breakeven target, which it has successfully lowered: thanks to the level of cost efficiency achieved in production operations and the \"bestprice guarantee\" for its customers which this enables, the COP business unit continues to post profitable growth. In the fourth quarter of 2023 considered in isolation, COP realised an EBIT figure of 2.7 million euros, which represented an 18.3 % improvement on the same quarter in the previous year (COP EBIT for Q4 2022: 2.3 million euros).\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/9 description: The image shows the logo for \"viaprinto\".

In particular, the costs associated with the company's supervisory bodies, its general meeting and its investor relations activities are structural and company costs which are incurred for all of the company's business units. Moreover, the earnings generated by the Group company futalis were previously reported in this business unit, since the business activities of futalis, as a producer of pet food, could not be allocated to CEWE's other business units. In the past financial year, CEWE sold futalis in late December 2023 and thus removed futalis from its Group profit and loss account in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nIncluding futalis, in the financial year 2023 CEWE realised revenues in the amount of 8.6 million euros (2022: 8.3 million euros) in its Other Activities business unit, all of which are attributable to futalis. If futalis is included in the EBIT calculation, as it has been previously, then in the past financial year the Other Activities business unit registered a loss of – 3.1 million euros (2022: – 0.6 million euros). Of this amount, – 2.3 million euros related to futalis. This consists of a – 1.0 million euros operating loss, a – 0.8 million euros writedown on a production plant and a – 0.5 million euros deconsolidation loss.\n\nIf futalis is excluded, no revenues were realised in the Other Activities business unit in 2023 (2022: 0.0 million euros). The contribution to this business unit's Group EBIT, thus calculated, amounted to – 0.8 million euros (2022: – 0.6 million euros).\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/10 description: The image shows a wavy pattern of dots that transition in color from purple to blue.

This figure does not include the turnover of futalis which was sold in December 2023, since IFRS 5 requires its removal from the individual P&L items as a \"discontinued operation or operation disposed of\" (see also the comments in the \"Other Activities business unit\" section). Group turnover including the revenues provided by futalis increased by + 6.5 % or 47.8 million euros to 788.8 million euros (2022: 741.0 million euros). With both of these figures, CEWE has exceeded its envisaged turnover target range for 2023 of between 720 and 780 million euros.\n\n#### **Group EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros**\n\nThe CEWE Group's reported EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros in 2023 and thus reaches a new peak (EBIT in 2022: 75.6 million euros). The EBIT figure calculated including futalis' earnings rises to 81.6 million euros and is thus at the upper end of the EBIT target for 2023 (which is based on the same logic) of between 70 and 82 million euros. CEWE was able to compensate for the cost increases which affected all of its P&L items (and were mainly inflationdriven) by raising its own prices. Photofinishing, Retail and Commercial Online Printing have all contributed to this improvement in earnings. This is a very nice trend in all three of CEWE's business units in 2023.\n\n> With growth in its Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units, CEWE's turnover increased by 47.5 million euros or 6.5 % in 2023. This is once again an impressive trend.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/12 description: The image shows a blue line graph. The line starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, then dips down slightly before rising again to the top right.\n\n- Reported Group turnover increases by 47.5 million euros in 2023 to 780.2 million euros (2022: 732.7 million euros): a growth rate of 6.5 %\n- Reported Group EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros (2022: 75.6 million euros)\n- Group turnover incl. futalis which was sold in December 2023 increases by + 6.5 % or 47.8 million euros to 788.8 million euros (2022: 741.0 million euros). The CEWE Group's EBIT, thus calculated, rises to 81.6 million euros (2022: 75.6 million euros)\n- All goals for 2023 thus achieved at the upper end of the planned ranges or even exceeded\n- Tax rate at expected normal level of 32.2 %\n- Earnings per share increase to 8.10 euros (2022: 7.20 euros)\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/19 description: The image shows a background with a pattern of blue dots that appear to be arranged in a wave-like formation.

In 2020, the total is 728.5 with a +11.5% change, broken down into 67.8 for photofinishing, 34.1 for retail, and 620.0 for other activities. In 2021, the total is 694.9 with a -3.5% change, broken down into 66.0 for photofinishing, 31.2 for retail, and 590.1 for other activities.

In general, CEWE is continuing to benefit strongly from the company's early transformation resulting in its adoption of an online business model: growth is being driven by the trend of smartphone-based photography as well as photo products which can be ordered conveniently online or via smartphone apps. Together with its strong business partners which, with more than 20,000 retail stores in Europe, provide an additional guarantee of customer-oriented service, with its innovations CEWE is continuously driving the evolution of the photography market. The past year once again demonstrated that photo products in particular have\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n> a very high emotional value for many people – especially as a Christmas present – and that demand for them is on the rise, largely independently of the overall economic trend.\n\n#### **Inflation-influenced changes in P&L items strongly reflect business trend**\n\nThe contributions which the various business units provide to the profit and loss account varies in structural terms: in the Photofinishing business unit, the trend towards valueadded products generally means a lower volume of material expenditure but an increasing volume of personnel expenses and other operating expenses. Commercial Online Printing is generally characterised by a higher cost of materials and slightly lower personnel expenses and other operating expenses than in the Photofinishing business unit. On the other hand, Retail entails a significantly higher cost of materials but lower personnel expenses and other operating expenses than in the other two business units.\n\n**83.9**\n\nmillion euros EBIT in 2023 – a new high\n\nOn average, the CEWE Group had 3,903 employees in 2023 (2022: 3,816). Of this number, 2,615 employees or approx. 67.0 % (2022: 2,537 employees or 66.5 %) worked at the CEWE Group's German plants and 1,288 employees or 33.0 % (2022: 1,279 employees or 33.5 %) at the CEWE Group's foreign plants.\n\nThis slight change year-on-year is partially attributable to new hirings for central functions in Oldenburg, at White-Wall and, in Commercial Online Printing, at our Dresden production plant. Moreover, for the purpose of calculating\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/15 description: The image contains two charts and some text.

This trend reflects the 29.3 million euros increase in current assets in particular. This is attributable, above all, to the 44.3 million euros growth in liquidity and, on the other hand, the decrease in current receivables from income tax refunds on the basis of a tax assessment. In the previous year, high tax prepayments had been reported here on account of the coronavirus-related upswing. In addition, a lower figure has been reported for current trade receivables, since payments from business partners were delayed in the previous year and thus only settled in the past financial year.\n\nNon-current assets have increased by 4.0 million euros to 380.1 million euros. Above all, this is attributable to property, plant and equipment investments in new and modernised production space in the Photofinishing business unit. The amortisation-related decrease in intangible assets and the declining fair value measurement of financial investments, due to profits distributed by a VC fund investment, had the opposite effect.\n\n#### **CEWE has strong equity ratio of 58.4 % (previous year: 57.3 %)**\n\nEquity has increased by a total of 26.5 million euros by comparison with December 31, 2023 and amounts to 389.2 million euros. This mainly reflects positive comprehensive income for the past four quarters in the amount of 51.5 million euros. Following what was already a very solid level in the previous year (December 31, 2022: 57.3 %), the equity ratio has once again increased, to 58.4 %.\n\nThe Group's debt (the total of current and non-current liabilities) has risen by 6.8 million euros from 269.9 million euros to 276.7 million euros. This growth is attributable to the 6.2 million euros increase in current liabilities to 202.4 million euros, specifically the personnel liabilities included in this item as well as the earnings-related increase in tax accruals. Non-current liabilities have changed only slightly, with an increase of 0.6 million euros to 74.3 million euros. The growth in pension accruals which this item mainly consists of contrasts with a decrease in non-current lease liabilities due to the expiry of the time limits in question.\n\nThe management balance sheet shows total assets of 666.0 million euros reduced by current, non-interestbearing operating liabilities in the total amount of 192.9 million euros, as well as the debt and equity elements subject to interest and dividends totalling 473.1 million euros.\n\n#### **Capital employed rises by 26.7 million euros, mainly due to the turnover-related increase in trade receivables and investment-related fixed assets growth**\n\nThe volume of capital employed has risen by 26.7 million euros year-on-year, due to an increase in both cash and cash equivalents (+ 44.3 million euros) and non-current assets (+ 4.0 million euros). Liquidity thus reflects the strength of operating cash flow. On the other hand, net working capital has increased (– 21.6 million euros). Non-operating liabilities mainly relate to pension accruals and increase by 4.2 million euros due to a reduced accounting interest rate.\n\n#### **Solid equity causes the volume of capital invested to increase by 26.7 million euros**\n\nThe 26.7 million euros rise in the volume of capital invested is attributable to the 26.5 million euros increase in equity. In equity, the comprehensive income item of 51.5 million euros reflects CEWE's earnings strength, which more than compensates for the dividend payment and the other changes in equity. Gross financial liabilities decrease by 3.9 million euros due to the decline in lease liabilities. Non-operating liabilities mainly relate to pension accruals and increase by 4.2 million euros due to a reduced accounting interest rate.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nKey changes to balance sheet items\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/7 description: This image shows the balance sheet on Dec. 31, 2023 in millions of euros.

Following the increase in the previous year, they contributed 10.8 million euros less to operating cash flow. Taking a slight increase in inventories into consideration, net operating working capital absorbed 14.4 million euros less cash in the past financial year. Other net working capital also absorbed 2.8 million euros less cash than in the previous year. Tax payments likewise decreased, falling by 10.9 million euros.\n\n#### **Due to a reduced volume of company acquisitions as well as offsetting financial income, net cash used in investing activities decreases to – 47.9 million euros**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities declines to – 47.9 million euros, above all due to the absence of payments for the purchase of shares in companies, increased inflows from financial assets and payments for operational investments which are slightly lower than in the previous year.\n\n- Operating cash flow increases by 37.4 million euros to 130.8 million euros and thus exceeds pre-coronavirus level\n- Operating cash flow in particular results in 51.4 million euros increase in free cash flow\n- Normalised free cash flow of 69.7 million euros is 8.3 million euros higher than the normalised previous year's level of 61.4 million euros\n\n**130.8**\n\nmillion euros cash flow from operating activities\n\n#### **Cash flow from operating activities**\n\nin millions of euros / change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/21 description: The image is a bar graph comparing values from 2019 to 2023.

The first chart, titled \"Free cash flow in millions of euros / change on previous year as %,\" shows the following data: 2019: 35.5 (+>1.000%), 2020: 103.3 (+191%), 2021: 21.5 (-79.2%), 2022: 31.5 (+46.6%), and 2023: 82.8 (+51.4, +163%). A note states, \"Free cash flow rises by 51.4 million euros in 2023 to 82.8 million euros.\" Additional information includes: \"Cash outflows from company acquisitions (+7.7 million euros): no company acquisitions in financial year,\" \"Inflows from investments in financial assets (+4.4 million euros),\" and \"Cash outflows for operational investments (+2.4 million euros).\" The second chart, titled \"Net cash used in investing activities in millions of euros / change on previous year as %,\" presents the following data: 2019: -67.2 (+11.9%), 2020: -39.0 (+41.9%), 2021: -44.1 (-13.1%), 2022: -40.2 (-61.9), and 2023: -47.9 (+14.0, +22.6%).\n\n#### **Operating cash flow in particular results in 51.4 million euros increase in free cash flow**\n\nOverall, free cash flow increased by 51.4 million euros to 82.8 million euros. This resulted from the 37.4 million euros increase in cash flow from operating activities to 130.8 million euros as well as a decrease in net cash used in investing activities to 47.9 million euros.\n\n#### **Normalised free cash flow of 69.7 million euros is 8.3 million euros higher than the normalised previous year's level of 63.7 million euros**\n\nThe financial year 2022 was shaped by the fact that – as outlined above – some business partners only settled in the financial year 2023 liabilities with a volume of approx. 9.0 million euros which were attributable to the financial\n\nyear 2022. In addition, tax payments of 3.9 million euros exceeded the tax expense for the year 2022. Within the net cash used in investing activities, the purchase price payment for Hertz and the acquisition of an administrative site at CEWE's Oldenburg location generated an additional funding requirement of 17.0 million euros. In overall terms, the free cash flow in 2022 was thus reduced by 29.9 million euros. In the financial year 2023, operating cash flow decreased by 11.5 million euros due to tax payments which were lower than the volume of tax expense in 2023, on account of the reimbursement of tax prepayments. Moreover, an additional approx. 9.0 million euros in liabilities to business partners from the financial year 2022 had been repaid in the first quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operating activities was thus increased by 20.5 million euros. Within the net cash used in investing\n\nactivities, cash outflows due to capacity-boosting new buildings and significant expansions of production plants resulted in an additional funding requirement of 12.8 million euros. In addition, CEWE received profits distributed from financial investments in the amount of 5.4 million euros. Overall, free cash flow in 2023 accordingly increased by 13.1 million euros.\n\n**Net cash used in investing activities** in millions of euros / \n\nchange on previous year as %\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Free cash flow** in millions of euros / change on previous year as %\n\n3 Combined Management Report\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>32</sup>\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n#### **Normalised cash flow 2022 vs. 2023** in millions of euros\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/7 description: This image contains two charts. The first chart is a waterfall chart showing cash flow from operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and free cash flow for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, cash flow from operating activities is 106.3, net cash used in investing activities is -44.9, and free cash flow is 61.4. For 2023, free cash flow is 82.8, net cash used in investing activities is -40.5, and cash flow from operating activities is 130.8. The second chart is a table showing the normalisation account for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, advance debt collection by business partners is 9, tax payments exceeding tax expense is 3.9, normalisation of cash flow from operating activities is 12.9, acquisition of Hertz is 7.7, special investments in real estate (purchase/construction) is 9.3, distribution of profits from financial investments is not listed, and normalisation of net cash used in investing activities is 17, and normalisation of free cash flow is 29.9. For 2023, advance debt collection by business partners is -9, tax payments exceeding tax expense is -11.5, normalisation of cash flow from operating activities is -20.5, acquisition of Hertz is not listed, special investments in real estate (purchase/construction) is 12.8, distribution of profits from financial investments is -5.4, normalisation of net cash used in investing activities is 7.4, and normalisation of free cash flow is -13.1.\n\nWithout these effects, free cash flow in 2022 would have amounted to 61.4 million euros and that of the current financial year to 69.7 million euros, which clearly exceeds the previous year's figure.\n\n#### **Operating cash flow in particular results in 25.6 million euros increase in free cash flow in the fourth quarter**\n\nFree cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 increases by 25.6 million euros to 92.7 million euros. Compared to the same quarter in the previous year, cash flow from operating activities accounted for 22.1 million euros of this increase. The total of EBITDA and non-cash effects increases by 5.3 million euros. Net working capital flow decreases by comparison with the fourth quarter in the previous year (15.7 million euros) and thus strengthens cash flow from operating activities. This decline has resulted from the payments from business partners which in 2023 once again occurred in the fourth quarter, together with an increase in trade payables. At the same time, the company paid 1.1 million euros less in taxes. Another factor impacting the free cash flow is the net cash used in investing activities, which increased by 3.5 million euros, mainly on account of the profits distributed from financial investments.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\ne 2.

The turnover trend for the core Photofinishing business unit will improve slightly, on average. The Retail business unit is expected to once again register a slight decline in turnover generated by photo hardware, while Commercial Online Printing will likely achieve further slight turnover growth in most markets.\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n#### **EBIT earnings target range in 2024: 77 to 87 million euros**\n\nIn 2024, Group EBIT will fall within a range of between 77 million euros and 87 million euros, the EBT figure will amount to between 75.5 million euros and 85.5 million euros, while earnings after tax will lie within a range of 51 million euros to 58 million euros.\n\n#### **Operational investments planned at normal level**\n\nThe operational investments planned for 2023 (i.e. outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) are expected to be around 65 million euros.\n\n#### **Goal is for continuous further dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE considers itself an extremely reliable dividend payer. The dividend proposed for 2023 would represent a 15th consecutive increase. In general, CEWE pursues the goal of dividend continuity. Where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities, this means a dividend which is\n\n# **77 – 87**\n\nmillion euros EBIT figure planned for 2024\n\nat least unchanged in absolute terms, and ideally an increased dividend. This policy clearly focuses on the absolute dividend value, with the payout ratio or the dividend yield as a secondary element.\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/18 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Long term revenue\" with the x-axis representing years from 1992 to 2024 and the y-axis representing revenue.

On the one hand, general cost increases affecting consumers might impact their spending or lead to them to travel less and thus influence the number of photos they take and the volume of orders they place. On the other hand, continuing inflation at CEWE might result in a further increase in costs and the cost of sales. That would necessitate compensatory price increases, which might negatively affect consumer demand. To take account of these external conditions and reflect their potential effects on CEWE's business development in its planning, CEWE has also defined ranges for all of its relevant target figures for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe ranges for these targets for 2024 represent approximate figures and reflect the current uncertainties. In its operational planning for 2024, the Board of Management naturally aims to achieve a target in the upper half of this envisaged range.\n\n#### **Targets for 2024 CEWE Group**\n\n|                             |                   | 2024         | Change<br>as % |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Photos                      | billion units     | 2,3 to 2,4   | -2 to +2       |\n| CEWE PHOTOBOOK              | million units     | 5,9 to 6,2   | -2 to +2       |\n| Operational investments1    | Mio.

Where is the red we're so used to?**\n\n**YR:** The red is still there – in CEWE's umbrella brand. But we decided to take the important step of giving the CEWE business group – with its many strong brands – a new platform. Both visually, as you can see, but also from the point of view of content. With combined goals, priorities and principles. The intention is for all our brands to shine here with equal prominence. After all, we are a group and together we are more than the sum of our individual parts.\n\n#### **That sounds like you have already gained a very detailed overview of this wide-ranging group and have settled in very nicely at CEWE.**\n\n**YR:** Yes, definitely! I joined CEWE a year ago.\n\n#### **Time flies.**\n\n**YR:** Undoubtedly so – particularly at CEWE. But I have a couple of comments in response to your question.\n\n#### **We're all ears!**\n\n**YR:** First of all, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for the very warm welcome I have received. That applies to the other members of the Board of Management, but I was welcomed with open arms everywhere else, too. Whether in Oldenburg, Koźle, Mönchengladbach, Cologne, Paris or Germering – CEWE has a remarkable team spirit which I have noticed everywhere. It has been a great experience, which has brought home to me CEWE's immense strength: its outstanding spirit of togetherness which we call \"The WE in CEWE\". We can count on one another. In a company where so many processes are so tightly intertwined, effective collaboration is key.\n\n#### **And your second comment?**\n\n**YR:** That our business is a unique and complex one – after all, we produce on-demand. We are very strong in terms of our depth of added value, which enables us to offer a highly integrated photofinishing solution – with a growing level of customer satisfaction. Within the company, that\n\nrequires a deep understanding of many different ramifications and details. It takes some time to understand that and to handle things accordingly. That brings us back to the topic of collaboration. Not only do our members of staff grasp these details – they also work together to outstanding effect, thus continuously improving the service which CEWE offers our customers. An important lesson I learned during my first year was CEWE's unique ability to produce this unbelievably high level of quality. Particularly at crunch time – our Christmas quarter, which spans the entire fourth quarter – it is crucial that everything functions smoothly. We operate a three-shift production system, our marketing activities are in full swing, and our customer service assists customers around the clock. Every year, we demonstrate again and again our mastery of all this.\n\ncewe group\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nt Report 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n#### **I get that. You referred to a complex business – was your sale of futalis a step you took to reduce CEWE's complexity?**\n\n→ Interview\n\n**YR:** futalis, a young company focusing on customised dog food, has experienced various phases in its development. To start off with, it received support from High-Tech-Gründerfonds (HTGF), a seed investor initiated by the German government which assisted futalis with its start-up expertise.\n\nFollowing this phase, industrialisation of futalis' highly specific customised production process was required. That task was a perfect fit for CEWE since we are experts in the highly automated production of individual items, as we have demonstrated in our Photofinishing business unit for decades. We therefore stepped up our commitment here and increased our shareholding. We used our expertise to help futalis with the development and realisation of a machine which automates the mixing process for customised dog food. With this technology, futalis reached an important milestone: in principle, its business is now profitably scalable.\n\n#### **That sounds very promising. So why did you sell futalis?**\n\n**YR:** Well, at that point there was a need for market expertise above all – both in the purchasing market for dog food ingredients and in the sales market. None of that is a core area of expertise of CEWE. But the situation is different for futalis – it has that expertise, or is continuously developing it. While futalis' turnover volume was less than 10 million euros, it nonetheless required attention. For\n\nthese reasons, we had already initiated a sales process in 2019/2020, but this was then hampered by the pandemic. So we had another go once the pandemic was over, and this was brought to a successful close in late 2023. The effects can be seen in CEWE's annual financial statements. We would like to wish the futalis team all the best for the company's continued development.\n\n#### **At any rate, you have thus removed a loss-maker from CEWE's profit and loss account!**\n\n**YR:** That is not the right way to interpret things. Last year futalis grew by more than 4 % despite the fact that many people cut back on their spending on pets in the postpandemic period. The loss which was removed from CEWE's profit and loss account in 2023 is mainly attributable to one-off deconsolidation effects. Over the past few years, futalis has carved out a respectable market position for itself which it can now build upon.\n\n**Ms Rostock, for 2023 you have achieved an earnings volume excluding futalis which exceeds your EBIT target range of between 70 and 82 million euros. That is an impressive start as CEO. Other new CEOs often recognise all manner of possible valuation adjustments in their first year ... and then claim that is due to their predecessors. Why haven't you done that?**\n\n**YR:** It's not my style to play games with earnings figures. I always aim to do my best and promote the long-term development of a business – I am not concerned with short-term effects. That is reflected in the corporate culture at CEWE and its preference for a long-term perspective – at CEWE, we think in terms of decades. We\n\nencourage solid and profitable development. A key goal was to bring 2023 to a close with very strong results, despite the difficult economic environment. We achieved that, and we spent the entire year preparing for it. Finally, in the fourth quarter everything came together and we had an outstanding business season, once again proving that \"we can do Christmas\".\n\n#### **Where do you intend to break new ground? What do you wish to change?**\n\n**YR:** I aim to strengthen strengths and leverage potential. As the CEWE Group, we are supported by various brands such as CEWE, Cheerz, Pixum and Saxoprint which are prospering individually and contributing to an outstanding overall result. We will continue to invest in these brands, with our know-how, exciting innovations and our key resource – our people whose work brings such joy to our customers. We are pursuing a clear strategy which is focused on healthy growth. Our guiding principle \"WE in CEWE\" defines the role of leadership and team spirit at our company: on an equal footing with one another, acting transparently and showing appreciation for one another. We live and work according to these principles at CEWE. We support one another and we are there for one another. With this internalised philosophy, we are continuously seeking to optimise things and achieve progress, while aiming to operate as efficiently as possible. We are driven by a spirit of innovation – this idea has deep roots in CEWE's DNA and has already carried the company through processes of transformation in the past. It is not for nothing that CEWE refers to 4,000 innovators in its Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units. We are\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1 CEWE at a Glance\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n**Financial Statements** 6 F\n\nlikewise always state-of-the-art in our current transformation processes: as I said before, at CEWE innovations are shaped by our entire workforce. That is equally true of the issues we are dealing with in relation to artificial intelligence. For instance, we are providing our employees with easy access to AI via our CEWE GPT initiative. At the same time, teams of experts such as our Mobile & Artificial Intelligence Campus (MAIC) are researching the development of new base technologies. We are already using AI – for instance, to improve the quality of photos sent by WhatsApp. AI shows great promise throughout our value chain and for our various stakeholders. We aim to use it responsibly. If we integrate AI the right way, we can use it as a partner which helps us and relieves us of the need to perform routine tasks – for consumers as co-creators, for our employees as co-workers, and for us as a business as a co-pilot.\n\n→ Interview\n\n#### **Exciting times lie ahead of us. Is there a guiding principle which you stand for, if you were forced to choose one?**\n\n**YR:** That brings me to the topic of customer centricity. That is probably the aspect of my career which has shaped me the most, coming from the beauty and consumer goods\n\nindustries. It provides you with different, additional perspectives, and I would like to continue to contribute these. We're adjusting things here and there but, as I have said, the CEWE system is running to outstanding effect, as the results for the past year demonstrate. Operating as a team, all of us at CEWE ensure that our photo products are a source of joy. That only works in concert with our customers, whose creativity and individuality turn our offerings into cherished products which carry great emotional significance and are full of personal stories, memories and experiences. We thus create products whose value far exceeds their price. We aim to trigger this feeling with every order. That is exactly why we are strongly focusing on indicators such as the NPS (Net Promoter Score), one of our key internal KPIs. If our customers are satisfied, that will generally also be reflected in our business figures.\n\n#### **Definitely, our figures speak for themselves!**\n\n**YR:** Very much so. 2023 was a year of new record figures at CEWE. With a turnover volume of 780.2 million euros, an EBIT of 83.9 million euros, an adjusted (and by adjusted I mean \"understated\") free cash flow of 69.7 million euros, a ROCE of 18.8 % and an equity ratio of 58.4 %, we either reached new highs or were very close to them. Our entire team has done outstanding groundwork here – I am all the more delighted to be part of all this.\n\n**One more question, since you are also in charge of distribution: the strong results you just mentioned are partly based on price increases which you implemented in 2023. Some companies have faced media accusations of \"greedflation\" for imposing price increases in their sales activities which are considerably higher than those justified for their purchasing operations. How are things at CEWE?**\n\n**YR:** As in 2022, we once again proceeded very cautiously in 2023. Our goal was to at least bring in as an absolute amount on the turnover side the cost increases which we had incurred due to inflation. In view of our rising volume of turnover – which was at least partly due to inflation – this would have reduced our percentage margin. We were therefore obliged to implement additional countermeasures, through efficiency gains in order to stabilise or increase our margin. For instance, if you look at what is probably the most meaningful operating margin in our Photofinishing business unit, we kept this at 12.7 % in 2022 and even increased it slightly to 12.8 % in 2023. CEWE has taken a very moderate course here: we have done what was necessary, but no more.\n\n#### **Ms Rostock, many thanks for the interview! We have the sense that you really have settled in well at CEWE.**\n\n**YR:** Thank you so much for your kind words. I am delighted to be here.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>\n\n🔍 < 39 >\n\n# CEWE share\n\n#### **Cash-rich blue chips and technology equities drive the stock markets in 2023**\n\n→ CEWE share\n\nThe trend on the financial markets was shaped by a wide range of factors in 2023: the ongoing high level of inflation, the interest-rate hikes implemented by leading central banks, the suspension of the USA's debt ceiling, the turbulence in the banking sector, the continuing war in Ukraine and the flare-up of the Israel conflict all generated a great deal of pressure and uncertainty. Having said that, the financial markets performed surprisingly strongly in some cases. However, despite frequently positive price performance many German stocks experienced a significant outflow of liquidity by comparison with previous years: many investors increasingly allocated their funds\n\n#### **Key share information**\n\n| Type of security            | No-par value share               |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Market segment              | Regulated market, PRIME STANDARD |\n| Index                       | SDAX (from March 23, 2009)       |\n| ISIN                        | DE 0005403901                    |\n| Symbol                      | CWC                              |\n| Reuters                     | CWCG.DE                          |\n| Bloomberg                   | CWC GR                           |\n| Date of initial quotation   | March 24, 1993                   |\n| Number of shares            | 7,442,003 units                  |\n| Daily volume (2023 average) | 4,906 units                      |\n| Annual high in 2023         | 102.00 euros                     |\n| Annual low in 2023          | 82.40 euros                      |\n| Year-end price 2023         | 101.20 euros                     |\n\nImage /page/40/Figure/11 description: The image shows a line graph comparing the CEWE share price with the DAX and SDAX indices from January 1, 2023, to March 1, 2024.

The graph indicates an annual low of 82.40 euros and an annual high of 102.00 euros.\n\nto fixed-interest investments. Small and mid caps were particularly badly affected by this development, since in many cases the group of potential investors likewise shrank here. While there were some initial indications of an opening of the primary market in 2023, even IPOs and spin-offs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland with higher levels of capitalisation were only placeable subject to considerable markdowns.\n\nFrom a segment point of view, blue chip companies in the Eurozone and the USA especially performed very strongly. In this context, at the end of the year Germany's DAX index reached a new all-time high of 17,003 points. In addition, the AI boom – which started with the launch of ChatGPT – triggered an upswing for many technology stocks. However, due to the ongoing high level of general uncertainty, above all stocks with low levels of liquidity and market capitalisation were subject to further markdowns. This in turn led to a mixed performance for Germany's share\n\nindexes. The DAX ended 2023 up 20.3 %, the MDAX rose by just 8.0 %, the SDAX performed more strongly, with growth of 17.0 %, while the TecDAX picked up by 14.3 %. The Scale All Share lost – 3.6 % and the Scale 30 as much as – 15.8 %.\n\n#### **CEWE share rises by 14.1 % in 2023**\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, the CEWE share achieved strong growth of 14.1 % and ended the year with a yearend price of 101.20 euros (year-end price 2022: 88.70 euros). Its performance was thus roughly in line with that of all 70 SDAX companies, whose market value rose by around 17 % on average. The average monthly volume of trading of the CEWE share on the XETRA index was roughly 9.7 million euros in 2023 (monthly average in 2021: 15.6 million euros). The weaker trading turnover of the CEWE share went hand in hand with an overall decrease in the volume of order book turnover in 2023 for all listed companies in XETRA trading.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nSmall and mid-caps such as CEWE were once again particularly badly affected here, since investors preferred highly liquid DAX stocks in particular and thus further reduced trading volumes for smaller companies.\n\n→ CEWE share\n\n#### **CEWE has strengthened its position in the SDAX**\n\nCompanies are allocated to a specific German stock index according to their level of \"market capitalisation\". Moreover, the German stock exchange regularly reviews whether a company meets the requirements for a particular level of minimum liquidity. The CEWE share clearly exceeds the minimum liquidity requirements; in terms of market capitalisation, CEWE moved up to 129th position at the end of 2023 (December 31, 2022: 137th position). The CEWE share has thus strengthened its position on the SDAX index, which normally features shares with a ranking of 165 or higher.\n\n#### **Dividend for 2023 to rise for a 15th consecutive occasion**\n\nWith a goal of dividend continuity, CEWE seeks to issue a dividend every year which ideally increases, but is at least unchanged in absolute terms, where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities. For the financial year 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA will propose to the general meeting an increase in the dividend to 2.60 euros for each share conferring a dividend entitlement (dividend for the financial year 2022: 2.45 euros). On the basis of the 2023 year-end price of 101.20 euros, this corresponds to a dividend yield of 2.6 %. If the general meeting which will be held on June 5, 2024 agrees to this proposal, this will be the highest dividend in the company's history and also a 15th consecutive dividend increase.

KG, Oldenburg) and Dr Caroline Neumüller (CN Assets GmbH & Co. KG, Oldenburg) – are CEWE's largest shareholders, with a combined interest of 27.1 %, and the company has thus enjoyed a high level of ownership stability for many years now. The group of notifiable investors with shareholdings in excess of 5 % also includes Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH. The small and mid-cap orientation of its fund means that it fits perfectly with CEWE.\n\n#### **The CEWE equity story: dependable stability, consistent rise in profitability, a market leader with steady growth**\n\nWhat makes investing in CEWE particularly attractive? CEWE's equity story can be summed up in terms of the following four aspects:\n\n> For many years, CEWE has enjoyed a high degree of ownership stability.\n\n#### **Shareholder structure** as % (100 % = 7.4 million shares)\n\nImage /page/42/Figure/12 description: The image shows a pie chart and a list of shareholders with their respective percentages. CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg has 4.2%, the heirs of the company's founder, Heinz Neumüller, have 27.1%, Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH has 5.1%, and other shareholders have 63.6%.\n\n#### 1. Dependable stability\n\nThanks to its strong equity ratio of almost 60 % and a very solid net cash position, CEWE has an extremely solid balance sheet. Demand (above all in Photofinishing) is largely independent of the general economic situation. Balance sheet stability and a stable level of demand provide very reliable and solid foundations for CEWE.\n\n#### 2. Consistent rise in profitability\n\nThe earnings margin of CEWE's Photofinishing core business unit – which has steadily risen for some years and is protected by strong brands – and its Commercial Online Printing business unit's long-term improvement in profitability promise further growth in earnings for the entire CEWE Group in future.\n\n#### 3. A market leader with steady growth\n\nAs a market leader and thus natural consolidator in the photofinishing sector, CEWE enjoys growth opportunities in many European countries. Moreover, innovations and the continuous development of new products are in CEWE's DNA. The trend towards smartphone photography and the use of artificial intelligence for product configuration and ordering underpin this growth.\n\n#### 4. Strong results\n\nWith earnings rising consistently for many years (as explained in the \"Long-term trend\" section above) and with a very respectable return on capital employed (ROCE), CEWE has not least proven to be an extremely reliable dividend payer: CEWE's dividend proposal for the financial year 2023 represents a 15th consecutive dividend increase for its shareholders.\n\nImage /page/42/Figure/21 description: The image shows the number 15 in a bold, sans-serif font. The number is a bright blue color and is set against a white background.\n\nyears of unbroken dividend growth: CEWE thus remains among the top three of all 644 listed companies in Germany!**1**\n\n#### **CEWE is there for its shareholders**\n\nThe clear objective of investor relations activities at CEWE is to notify all market participants promptly, comprehensively and equally in line with the principles of fair disclosure, while achieving a high level of overall transparency.\n\nCEWE thus naturally also publishes all of its annual and interim reports and capital market information online at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/3000/news-_-publications.html#main-body)**. All analyst telephone conferences are made available as webcasts and audiocasts on CEWE's website.

The key issues were presented to the other members of the committee no later than the next committee meeting.\n\nFollowing its appointment by the 2023 general meeting, the Audit Committee engaged the auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, including the combined management report for CEWE & Co. KGaA and the Group and to review the semi-annual financial report for the financial year 2023. In this regard, the Audit Committee determined the audit fee and discussed the key audit matters. It was agreed that the auditor would immediately notify the Supervisory Board of any incidents and findings resulting during the audit which are of material significance for the tasks of the Supervisory Board. Appropriate parameters were stipulated for the provision of non-audit services permitted under the relevant EU legislation. The Audit Committee satisfied itself of the auditor's necessary independence. The Audit Committee also engaged the auditor to review the consolidated, separate non-financial statement for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group – which is prepared in the form of a separate non-financial\n\nreport – as well as the remuneration report within the meaning of § 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) and the report on related parties within the meaning of § 312 AktG. The remuneration report is made available to the general public via CEWE's website.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the financial reporting of the company and the Group, including the intrayear financial reports (quarterly statements and the semi-annual financial report) and discussed these with the Board of Management. For this purpose, the auditor reported on the results of the audit activities which it had been tasked to undertake by the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management and on other findings and incidents of significance for the work of the Audit Committee. There were no objections.\n\nThe Audit Committee also examined the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal Group-wide control and risk management system as well as the ongoing development of the latter. In addition, the quarterly risk reports were discussed. The Audit Committee also discussed the reports provided by the compliance officer on compliance within the Group as well as significant legal disputes and the internal auditing department's status report.\n\nThe Audit Committee moreover considered CEWE's sustainability reporting and implementation of the reporting requirements arising from the EU Taxonomy and CSRD regulation. In the year under review, the Audit Committee once again ensured that it was kept regularly informed of any changes to the regulatory environment and discussed required measures, including the impact of the German Act Transposing the EU Minimum Tax Directive.\n\nThe auditor's provision of non-audit services and compliance with the parameters stipulated in this regard were monitored and adjustments were made.\n\nThe Board of Management also presented its report on transactions with related parties. There were no transactions requiring approval within the meaning of § 111b AktG.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>47</sup> → Report of the Supervisory Board\n\ntion 5 Financial Stateme\n\n← 🔍 < 47 >\n\nAn additional focus of the Audit Committee in the financial year 2023 – due to the required regular external rotation of the auditor upon expiry of the financial year 2023 – was the implementation of a transparent and discrimination-free process for the selection of the auditor for the financial year 2024. For this purpose, at its ordinary meeting on August 2, 2023 the Audit Committee had resolved to initiate a tender process pursuant to Art. 16 of the EU Audit Regulation. Following a multistage process and a careful review of the tendering firms in terms of their qualifications and independence, the Audit Committee passed a resolution on this matter at its meeting of November 7, 2023. The Audit Committee provided the Supervisory Board with a recommendation (including the reasons for this) that a proposal be made to the general meeting for either Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg, or PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Bremen, to be appointed as the auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2024 and to review the semi-annual financial report for the financial year 2024. The Audit Committee justified its preference for Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg.\n\nAt its balance sheet meeting held on March 18, 2024, in the presence of the auditor the Audit Committee discussed the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group, and the consolidated, separate non-financial report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group for the financial year 2023, including the auditor's audit reports and audit opinions, the related proposal for the appropriation of profits, the remuneration report and the report on related parties. It also prepared the corresponding resolutions to be adopted by the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee was provided with detailed information on the audit activities and audit findings of the auditor for the parent company as well as its German and foreign subsidiaries, particularly in relation to the key audit matters and the defined core audit areas. The audit of the accounting-related internal control system and the early risk detection system were also discussed in depth. The Audit Committee also considered the audit process and its level of quality at this meeting. Further members of the Supervisory Board were also able to attend this balance sheet meeting of the Audit Committee as guests.\n\n#### **Corporate governance**\n\nIn the year under review, the Supervisory Board had eight female members (until June 7, 2023)/six female members (from June 7, 2023) and four male members (until June 7, 2023)/six male members (from June 7, 2023) and thus continued to fulfil the Supervisory Board quota which is required by law.\n\nFor the financial year 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board have submitted an updated declaration of conformity in accordance with § 161 AktG, which is available on the company's website. In addition, in the management declaration – which the Supervisory Board adopts as its own – the Board of Management reports on corporate governance at CEWE (available at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/6000/corporate-governance.html)** – see Corporate governance/Declaration).\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nIn the reporting period, there were no conflicts of interest on the part of members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board which must be immediately disclosed to the Supervisory Board and notified to the general meeting.\n\n#### **Initial and advanced training**\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board independently receive the initial and advanced training that they require for their tasks. CEWE assists the members of the Supervisory Board here by providing them with access to membership of an online supervisory board portal with relevant instruction materials and reference works. New members of the Supervisory Board are able to obtain an overview of the company (onboarding) by discussing key matters and current topics with the Board of Management and the executives concerned.\n\n#### **Changes to the makeup of the executive bodies**\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung appointed Ms Yvonne Rostock, Ratingen, as the Chairwoman of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung. She took up her post on March 1, 2023.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>48</sup> → Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn 2023, regular elections to the Supervisory Board were held for the next term of office of around five years, i.e. up to the end of the general meeting which grants discharge to the Supervisory Board members for the fourth financial year since the start of their term of office, not including the financial year in which this term of office begins. The Supervisory Board members Ms Patricia Geibel-Conrad, Ms Marion Gerdes, Mr Alexander Oyen, Ms Elwira Wall and Mr Frank Zweigle retired from the Supervisory Board on June 7, 2023. On the other hand, Ms Daniela Mattheus and Mr Kersten Duwe were elected to the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA by the general meeting, while Mr Marc Bohlken, Mr Nural Altan and Mr Jan Grüneberg were elected to this executive body by CEWE's employees. These new members were in each case elected for the first time. The other members of the Supervisory Board were re-elected.\n\n#### **Annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, audit**\n\nThe annual financial statements and the management report, combined with the management report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, have been prepared by the Board of Management in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), while the consolidated financial statements and the combined consolidated management report have been prepared in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applied in the European Union (EU), as well as the provisions of German law which apply in addition under § 315e (1) HGB.\n\nBDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg – which was appointed as the auditor for the financial year 2023 by the general meeting – audited the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the consolidated management report combined with the management report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the financial year 2023, including the accounting, and issued an unqualified auditor's opinion in each case. Mr Jörg Sabath and Mr Christoph Hyckel have acted as the company's auditors. Mr Jörg Sabath has done so since the financial year 2019 and Mr Christoph Hyckel – as the auditor with responsibility for the audit – since the financial year 2021. The auditor also determined that the Board of Management has established an appropriate information and monitoring system which is suitable in order to identify early on any developments which jeopardise the continuation of the company as a going concern.\n\nAt its meeting held on March 18, 2024, the Audit Committee initially verified on the basis of the audit reports and the Board of Management's report that these two sets of financial statements and the combined management report provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in compliance with applicable accounting regulations. At this meeting, the auditor discussed in detail the process as well as the key findings of its audit of the separate financial statements and the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, including the key audit matters and the other core audit areas. The audit of the non-financial reporting and the remuneration report were also explained and discussed in detail. The auditor was available throughout the meeting to answer any further questions. In particular, it reported on the structure of the accounting-related internal controls and the risk management system. It did not report any significant weaknesses. The Chairwoman of the Audit Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on the audit findings on March 19, 2024.\n\nFor its part, the Supervisory Board also audited the annual financial statements, the proposal for appropriation of the unappropriated profits for 2023 as well as the consolidated financial statements, the combined consolidated management report and the remuneration report for the financial year 2023. All of these documents – including the auditor's audit reports – were provided in good time. The auditor was also present at the balance sheet meeting of the Supervisory Board held on March 19, 2024 and was available to provide further information. Additional questions from the members of the Supervisory Board prompted an in-depth discussion of the presented findings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was able to verify the appropriateness of the general partner's proposal for appropriation of unappropriated profits in relation to the company's net assets, financial position and results of operations and agreed to this proposal, following a discussion in the presence of the auditor. Finally, the Supervisory Board complied with its audit obligation under § 171 (1) sentence 4 AktG in relation to the consolidated nonfinancial statement and did not raise any objections.\n\nFollowing a preliminary audit by the Audit Committee at a meeting held on March 18, 2024, at its meeting of March 19, 2024 the Supervisory Board endorsed the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA as well as the combined management report, and found that there were no grounds for objections. Following the discussion at its balance sheet meeting held on March 19, 2024, the Supervisory Board agreed to the general partner's proposal to the general meeting to approve the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and moreover issued its consent to the general partner's proposal for the appropriation of profits, with the distribution of a dividend of 2.60 euros.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Report on related parties**\n\nThe Supervisory Board's independent audit likewise covered the report prepared by the general partner pursuant to § 312 AktG on relationships with affiliates (report on related parties) for the year under review. The report on related parties has also been audited by the auditor, which has issued the following audit opinion for this report:\n\n\"Upon due completion of our audit and assessment, we hereby confirm that\n\n- 1. the factual statements provided in the report are accurate,\n- 2. the company has not made any disproportionately large payment for any of the legal transactions listed in the report.\"\n\nThe report on related parties and the audit report of the auditor on the report on related parties were available to the Audit Committee at its meeting held on March 18, 2024 and to all of the members of the Supervisory Board at its balance sheet meeting held on March 19, 2024. Even after consultation with the auditor and the Board of Management following the final outcome of its audit, the Supervisory Board has not raised any objections in relation to the general partner's declaration at the end of its report on related parties. The Supervisory Board has approvingly noted the outcome of the auditor's audit of the report on related parties.\n\nOldenburg, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Its segment reporting by business unit also reflects these strategic business units (together with a further business unit, Other Activities).\n\n#### **The core business unit: Photofinishing**\n\nPhotofinishing is the name we give to our photo products business. CEWE is the European market leader in photofinishing, previously based on analogue film and now replaced by digital data. CEWE PHOTOBOOK has established itself as the key product in this field. CEWE has also continuously and rigorously expanded its product range.\n\nThrough its product management strategy, CEWE is not only developing new products but also strengthening demand and sales through its product and brand communication activities. Consumers can purchase CEWE's photofinishing products from business partners supplied by CEWE and also from CEWE directly. For almost all of the photofinishing products ordered from CEWE, CEWE also handles acceptance of orders and customer communication.\n\nEurope accounts for almost 100 % of CEWE's Photofinishing business.\n\n#### **CEWE RETAIL: proprietary hardware retail business is also a distribution channel for photofinishing products**\n\nCEWE has multichannel retailing operations for photo hardware and photofinishing products in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Scandinavia. In addition to selling photo hardware, over-the-counter outlets and online shops are a key channel for distributing CEWE photo products directly to end-consumers. Turnover and income from photofinishing products are shown in the Photofinishing business unit.\n\n#### **Commercial Online Printing: printing products for the commercial sector**\n\nCEWE is active in its Commercial Online Printing business unit through the production and marketing of printed advertising media via the distribution platforms SAXO-PRINT, viaprinto and LASERLINE. CEWE operates its Commercial Online Printing business unit for printed advertising media in Germany and other European countries, where local websites are present. The depth of added value in Commercial Online Printing is very similar to Photofinishing. However, CEWE provides less software here for the creation of printed products (unlike in the case of CEWE PHOTOBOOK, for instance).\n\nImage /page/53/Picture/17 description: The image shows logos of different companies. From left to right, the first row contains the logos of \"cewe\", \"pixum\", \"WHITE WALL\", and \"DeinDesign.\". The second row contains the logos of \"Cheerz\", \"SAXOPRINT\", and \"viaprinto\".\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>Organisation and management systems\n\n#### **Organisational structure**\n\nThe CEWE business group has the following structure:\n\nImage /page/54/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart. At the top left is a box labeled \"Limited shareholders\" which points to a box labeled \"General meeting\". To the right of the \"General meeting\" box is a box labeled \"Board of Trustees\". The \"General meeting\" box points to a box labeled \"Supervisory Board\". The \"Board of Trustees\" box points to a box labeled \"General partner: Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\". Both the \"Supervisory Board\" and the \"General partner: Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\" boxes point to a blue box labeled \"CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg (operating business)\".\n\n**[see Board of Management, pages 185 f.](#page-186-0)**\n\nIn 2023, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung was represented by seven members of the Board of Management. The Group's other 3,896 staff (2023 average) were employed by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the subordinate Group companies.\n\n#### **Legal structure combines the advantages of the capital market and a family approach**\n\nThe legal form of a partnership limited by shares enables the CEWE Group to combine the typical strengths of capitalmarket-oriented companies with those of family firms.\n\nThe company's founder, Senator h.c. Heinz Neumüller, intended to ensure that his entrepreneurial principles would remain permanently established within the company. He also aimed to ensure the company's long-term future. This is safeguarded through Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the large interest held by AN Assets GmbH & Co. KG and CN Assets GmbH & Co. KG (the heirs of the company's founder, Heinz Neumüller, and the company's largest shareholders with a combined 27.1 % stake, **[see Shareholder Structure, page 41](#page-42-0)**). The former ensures that the business group continues to be managed true to the legacy of Heinz Neumüller and thus upholds the character of the family firm. It stands for a long-term orientation in terms of the company's business policy. For this reason, it is also responsible for its management.\n\nThe company's founder always demanded that the CEWE business group should operate innovatively, while optimising income. The capital market effectively promotes these entrepreneurial objectives. The decision-making of the company's executive bodies – i.e. its management and its Supervisory Board – reflects its shareholders' interest in an attractive investment, with the goal of solid and sustainable long-term growth in the value of the company and thus of their investment. **[see Results, from page 61](#page-62-0)**\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nManagement Report 4\n\neration 5 Financial St\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>In the view of the Board of Management, the combination of these two advantages enables an innovative company which is managed on the basis of an income-oriented and sustainable business model and which also lives up to its social responsibility as an employer and as an economic engine.\n\nAs its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is entitled to receive reimbursement from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA or for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA to bear any expenses resulting in connection with its management activities. For its management activities and to cover its personal liability Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung receives annual remuneration – irrespective of any profit or loss – in the amount of 50,000 euros plus any value added tax applicable.\n\n#### **CEWE operates through a total of 35 subsidiaries**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is the parent company which manages all of the CEWE Group's activities. Retail is directly combined with Photofinishing in countries where a production plant is present. Otherwise, it operates independently. From an operational point of view, photo products are also sold through the Group's retail companies. However, in terms of strategic management they form part of the Photofinishing business unit, since they follow an entirely different growth path and their strategic significance differs from that of photo hardware, which is reported in the Retail business unit.\n\n#### **Management of the CEWE Group**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is responsible for overall planning and fulfilment of the goals of the CEWE Group. The allocation of responsibilities is set out in the \"Other disclosures\" section of the Notes **1 [see pages 185 f](#page-186-0)**.\n\n#### **Regular strategic planning: economic forecast reflects identifiable trends**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung determines the long-term strategy of the CEWE Group. This reflects trends in CEWE's competitive, market and technological environment. The Board of Management reviews the company's strategic orientation several times a year and discusses the resulting tactical and operational measures. External experts also take part in these meetings, where necessary. At least once a year, the company's current strategy is discussed with its supervisory bodies as well as its executives, and the core aspects of this strategy are communicated within the company.\n\n#### **Investments on the basis of profitability calculations**\n\nInvestments which consistently assume profitability calculations and which entail continuous as well as follow-up monitoring also form part of the company's corporate planning.\n\n#### **Close monitoring through monthly target/actual comparisons**\n\nEvery month, a target/actual comparison is implemented for the strategic business units and for each of the profit centres as well as for the CEWE Group as a whole. This monitoring includes the profit centres of the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. These target/previous year/actual comparisons enable close monitoring of goal achievement and an early response by the Board of Management and the management. At the same time, these and other operating indicators of the production plants and the distribution companies are passed on to all of the managers of these profit centres, for internal benchmarking and discussion. The key financial performance indicators used at CEWE are outlined in the \"Goals and strategies\" section **see pages 54 f**.\n\n#### Goals and strategies\n\nFindings derived from market research and strategic activities are factored into CEWE's long-term forecast model and provide CEWE's management with a perspective on possible future profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, cash flows and the company's enterprise value.\n\n#### **Continuous business development: CEWE defines initiatives and consistently follows through on them**\n\nOn the basis of this forecast, CEWE defines initiatives so as to drive forward its future development in the interest of the company and its various stakeholders. The effect of these initiatives is also factored into CEWE's forecast model. Within the scope of the structures outlined above, the company's management thus continuously monitors the implementation of these initiatives. In this way, CEWE is evolving all the time.\n\n#### **A focus on long-term profit and enterprise value**\n\nThrough these measures, CEWE clearly focuses on optimising its long-term business performance. Earnings for a single quarter or even for an entire year are viewed within the perspective of the company's long-term development. CEWE thinks in terms of decades.\n\n#### **The goal: profitable and capital-efficient growth, which will boost enterprise value**\n\nThe supreme long-term goal of the CEWE Group is continuously profitable and capital-efficient growth. For this purpose, CEWE uses both financial and non-financial performance indicators, for which annual target figures are published. No target figures are published for the additional, balance-sheet-related performance indicators.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nfigure for the following year is indicated in the forecast. not discussed in external communications. **Turnover and EBIT/EBT are very closely monitored for operational purposes** CEWE analyses its turnover trend every day in all of its units (but not for the consolidated Group) and conducts a monthly review of its earnings (incl. EBT) as key variables. The financial statements prepared by all of the Group's companies are likewise consolidated and analysed in a target/actual/previous-year comparison. Deviations from target figures and previous-year figures are assessed in\n\n#### → Basic information on the Group\n\n**Non-financial performance indicators: number of photos and CEWE PHOTOBOOKS**\n\nCEWE uses the total number of photos as a non-financial performance indicator in the Photofinishing business unit. These photos also include all of the images which are used in value-added products (e.g. CEWE PHOTOBOOK, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and other photo gifts). Due to the key significance of this product, the number of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS produced is shown as a separate indicator. CEWE's management analyses all of these indicators at least weekly, and in some cases daily. CEWE also provides information on its development in its annual report, by means of a target/actual comparison, and discusses this in the \"Results\" chapter **[see page 61](#page-62-0)**. A target Non-financial performance indicators do not play such a significant role in Commercial Online Printing and thus are\n\nterms of their effect on financial goals. The responsible individuals already account for any such discrepancies through comments during preparation of the company's reports. The earnings of the company's strategic business\n\nunits are monitored at the level of turnover and EBIT. The Board of Management discusses every month both earnings in the strategic business units and for the Group as a whole and the detailed figures for the individual profit centres. This monitoring includes the profit centres of the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nInvestments are an important indicator, since they have a significant impact on the volume of capital employed (which is practically irreversible over the useful life of the capital item) and (besides the earnings figure) have the largest impact on free cash flow. The situation differs for the additional indicator \"Operating working capital\", as outlined further below. CEWE therefore monitors investments very closely. Beyond the volume already authorised, subsequent increases in these areas are not possible without further authorisation from the responsible investment managers. Consolidated investment reporting\n\nis provided at least quarterly in the first half of the year. During the phase of larger investments – i.e. in preparation for year-end business – the management reviews this indicator every month.\n\n#### **Additional indicators: ROCE, free cash flow and operating working capital**\n\nIn each quarterly statement and every quarterly and annual report, CEWE analyses its ROCE figure to determine the rate of return on its capital employed. For many years now, CEWE has achieved figures above the 15 % mark. Since CEWE's pre-tax capital cost rate has been below 10 % for some years now, according to analysts' calculations in their research reports, CEWE is certainly delivering increasing value. The long-term goal is a ROCE figure which continues to clearly exceed the capital costs.\n\n#### **CEWE performance indicators**\n\n|                          |                        | Internal reporting | External reporting | Forecast for the year |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Non-financial indicators | Total number of photos | Week               | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | CEWE PHOTOBOOKS        |                    |                    | yes                   |\n| Financial indicators     | Turnover               | Day                | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | EBIT                   | Month              |                    | yes                   |\n|                          | EBT                    |                    |                    | yes                   |\n|                          | Investments            | Month/quarter      | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | Earnings after tax     | Quarter            | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | Earnings per share     |                    |                    | yes                   |\n| Additional indicators    | ROCE                   | Quarter            | Quarter            | -                     |\n|                          | Free cash flow         |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Operating WC           |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Equity ratio           |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Dividend               | Year               | Year               | -                     |\n\nWE focus on initiatives\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/16 description: The image shows a document with the titles of different sections.

As well as investments – which are closely monitored, as already mentioned – and EBIT, the development of operating working capital is a key factor affecting capital employed and the free cash flow. This figure is therefore explained together with the ROCE and the free cash flow. As already outlined above, more frequent assessment of this figure is not necessary, since undesirable effects on working capital as of the reporting date can generally be compensated for on a short-term basis. For instance, a business partner's year-end payment which is delayed by just a few days can easily reduce the company's free cash flow by several million euros. While any such development will naturally be closely monitored, in operational terms it is generally meaningless, particularly since other operational monitoring systems highlight such delays much more directly than the cash flow statement does. Moreover, from the point of view of its outflow of liquidity, CEWE's liquidity is so strong that the company is able to exploit an earnings opportunity, even on a shortterm basis, to the detriment of its liquidity.\n\n#### **Solid balance sheet: equity ratio as a further indicator**\n\nCEWE aims to ensure the company's continuous and sustainable development. For instance, the indicators of a strong balance sheet include sufficient cash reserves, available lines of credit and a solid equity ratio. At the present time, CEWE considers its level of capitalisation to be stable, with an equity ratio in excess of 50 %. In CEWE's opinion, sufficient liquidity or sufficient lines of credit and an extremely solid equity capital position (also by comparison with the competition) not only boost the company's stability and resilience in the event of a crisis, they also enable it to purposefully exploit any strategic options which become available, such as attractive acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe company's ROCE, free cash flow, working capital and equity ratio are analysed in further detail in the quarterly financial statements. Due to possible short-term setbacks which may arise for the company's cash flow or working capital, as outlined above, no precise planning variables are stated for these additional indicators. Due to their significance, these indicators are discussed in detail in the \"Results\" chapter **[see page 61](#page-62-0)**.\n\n#### **Goal: absolute annual dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE has the declared goal of offering its shareholders a dividend on the basis of its earnings figure which increases slightly each year, where possible, or is at least constant, if the company's economic situation permits this. The distribution ratio is explicitly not a control variable, and is rather the outcome of this dividend policy.\n\n#### Research & development\n\nIn December 2023, almost exactly three out of four images transferred from the order processing clients to CEWE's production plants for production had been taken by smartphones. This proportion is roughly uniform for all ordering channels (desktop, mobile and CEWE Photostation). In this year, it was once again clear that CEWE is pursuing the right approach for its brands by offering solutions for computers, browsers and apps and that the effort of supporting all of the main operating systems and integrating in the design process relevant online storage locations such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft is paying off. The links between these ordering channels and CEWE Photostations – via CEWE myPhotos or directly via the smartphone app – and thus support for our omnichannel approach were again bolstered in the year under review and are set to be expanded even further.\n\nThe applications developed at CEWE's \"Mobile and Artificial Intelligence Campus\" (MAIC) were expanded and also rolled out to subsidiaries during the reporting year and (in the Board of Management's view) further enhanced. They also gained new features which make the experience of designing products even more fun. These include an AIbased design process functionality which optimally determines the relevant section of an image which will fit an available frame and another functionality (also AIbased) which suggests the right background colours for a page.\n\nThese types of changes were incorporated in the various ordering channels. Significant further improvements (in the company's view) were made to the customer service chatbot, in terms of functionalities and the user experience, and this chatbot was also made available to our subsidiaries. Feedback from customers is encouraging us to continue down this path and make greater use of our bot to handle simple and frequently submitted queries.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remun\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>57</sup>\n\nThese and all of CEWE's other artificial intelligence applications (also combined with traditional algorithms) are transparently presented in CEWE's customer charter at **1 [www.cewe.ai](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/customer-charter-and-advisory-council.html)**, and a number of further applications were added in 2023. The benefit for customers and protection of their privacy are always the prime considerations. Images will not be transferred to public albums or to servers outside the scope of the GDPR or else to third parties for marketing purposes. Consumers retain full control over the whereabouts of their images and their analysis in order to suggest design ideas.\n\n#### **My CEWE PHOTOWORLD**\n\nConsumers generally use our software \"My CEWE PHOTO-WORLD\" to produce CEWE PHOTOBOOKS. This software is available for Windows, Mac and Linux computers and for Android and iOS smartphones. Many CEWE customers are therefore transferring their images from their smartphones to their computers. Customers have long recognised the benefit of transferring their images to a computer when placing an order with CEWE: the design process is even faster and more intuitive, and transferring pictures to a PC also means that important images are backed up. Further MAIC functions have been incorporated for this purpose. This has brought further improvements to the design process for individual pages, but also to the auto-suggest function in the desktop software and smartphone app versions of the CEWE PHOTOBOOK assistant. As regards CEWE's smartphone apps, a new editor function for placing orders was completed for CEWE Calendar ahead of the Christmas season and made available to the company's customers. This has resulted in a further increase in the conversion rate, but above all in the level of customer satisfaction.\n\nNew products have been integrated in every category. CEWE PHOTOBOOK has been equipped with additional designs and templates for the yearbook campaign as well as finishes, while CEWE Calendar and gift items have gained attractive designs in particular. In the Board of Management's opinion, consumers very rapidly responded to these additional offerings, in order to produce even more attractive gifts for Christmas. The desktop software was launched in Germany and Austria in time for Christmas, while the new apps were available in all of the countries to which CEWE delivers.\n\n#### **COPS – the CEWE ONLINE PRINTING SYSTEM**\n\nHere too, a lot of work has been done on the editor functions which enable customers to order products. Above all, this is reflected in terms of the increased use of smartphones to order so-called \"single-image products\". Smartphone use has picked up strongly here, since customers do not necessarily wish to install an app for this on their devices. The Board of Management assumes that the company has fully achieved its goals of enhanced presentation of products and product details and, above all, improving the mobile journey for customers. This has also provided for a more uniform appearance across the range of ordering channels and further refined the company's omnichannel approach for this ordering channel too.\n\n#### **High-performance back-end system further optimised and AI-based function improved**\n\nIn the year under review, CEWE invested in increased bandwidths for the transfer of image data from its online platform to its production plants. These investments covered its primary and backup cables. This means that data can now be transferred at a faster rate, supporting the ambitious goal of completing deliveries in time for Christmas. All of the above-mentioned applications and orders placed at the retail outlets of CEWE's business partners through CEWE PHOTOSTATIONS deliver finalised jobs to CEWE's back-end system. This back-end system continues to be distributed across two independent and redundant data centres. To ensure rapid transmission of these data volumes from the central data centres to the company's production plants, as usual the necessary additional servers were installed ahead of the Christmas season. Low-resolution images (e.g. from WhatsApp) are resized using AI methods (generative adversarial networks – GANs) and improved versions were tested and implemented in the year under review. We are thus delivering better product results for large-scale images such as a big CEWE Calendar.\n\nThe company also implemented further measures in order to optimise the sustainability of its IT processes. CEWE has once again reduced the volume of racks required in its data centres and thus their level of electricity consumption by means of further virtualisation as well as new highercapacity servers and storage devices.\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** This symbol indicates that further information may be found on the Internet.

It averaged 5.7 % over the year 2023 as a whole. This corresponds to a 0.4 percentage-point increase by comparison with 2022. This is primarily attributable to the large number of immigrants, and refugees especially. From roughly mid-2022, Ukrainian refugees were covered by Germany's social security system.**3**\n\nIn 2023, as in the previous year inflation in Germany was exceptionally high in historical terms. On average over the past year, the HICP inflation rate amounted to 6.0 % (2022: 8.7 %), but the rate of inflation declined significantly over the course of the year. What remained a high level of inflation reflected the very strong increases in food prices, which continued to rise by comparison with the previous year, 2022. Price growth for services was also stronger in\n\n**6** Destatis: [https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-](https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-Finanzen/Inflation.html)\n\n**7** Statista: [https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/) [ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/)\n\n[Finanzen/Inflation.html](https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-Finanzen/Inflation.html)\n\n2023 than previously.**4** At the same time, nominal wages also picked up strongly in Germany: in the third quarter of 2023, they increased by 6.3 % on the same quarter in the previous year, while consumer prices climbed by 5.7 % in the same period. Real wages were thus 0.6 % higher than in the same quarter in the previous year.**5**\n\n#### **High inflation and ten consecutive interest-rate hikes**\n\nWorldwide, inflation was running at 6.8 % in 2023. Inflation in the EU, measured in terms of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), averaged 6.4 % in 2023. Price momentum decreased by comparison with the previous year (2022: 9.2 %): the highest price rises were registered for \"food and non-alcoholic beverages\" (12.6 %) and \"restaurants and accommodation services\" (8.4 %). On a monthly basis, in December 2023 inflation in the Eurozone fell to 2.9 %; the highest rate of inflation in the Eurozone's history, around 10.6 %, had been registered in October 2022.**6** On July 21, 2022, the European Central Bank reacted to the strong inflationary momentum and raised interest rates in the Eurozone for the first time in eleven years: from zero to 0.5 %. This was followed by a series of nine further interest-rate hikes. Following its tenth consecutive interestrate rise on September 14, 2023, from October 26, 2023 onwards the ECB finally left its key interest rate at 4.5 %.**7**\n\nThe euro's exchange rate against the US dollar averaged 1.0813 euros in 2023 and thus clearly exceeded the previous year's average of 1.0530 euros (2022) – with a fluctuation range between 1.1255 (July 18, 2023) and 1.0469 (October 3, 2023). As regards the currencies of relevance for CEWE, **<sup>1</sup>** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff.\n\nMarkets\n\nEconomic report\n\n#### **High inflation dampens global economic growth**\n\nAccording to the current estimate from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global growth rate in 2023 was just 3.1 % (2022: 3.5 %). Growth in the developed economies fell from 2.6 % in 2022 to 1.6 % in 2023. With a rate of 0.5 % in 2023, the Eurozone's economy registered significantly slower growth than in the previous year (2022: 3.5 %).**1**\n\nAccording to the IMF's estimates, in the second half of 2023 especially economic growth in the United States and several major emerging markets and developing countries was stronger than expected. Government and private spending made real contributions to this upswing. Increases in disposable income are buoying consumption in the context of labour markets which remain tense, even if they are easing. Households fell back on the savings they had accumulated during the pandemic. A broadbased increase in labour market participation and the resolution of the supply chain problems inherited from the pandemic era contributed to growth on the supply side. However, this growing momentum was not apparent everywhere: the dampened rate of growth in the Eurozone especially reflected weak consumer sentiment, the\n\n## continuing effects of high energy prices and weakness in terms of interest rate-sensitive productive and corporate investments.**2**\n\n#### **Recession in Germany**\n\nAccording to the IMF, Germany's real gross domestic product contracted by – 0.3 % in 2023, following growth of 1.8 % in the previous year. In 2023, Germany thus once again fell considerably short of the 0.5 % average growth\n\n→ Economic report\n\n<span id=\"page-59-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>58</sup>\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Economic report\n\nent Report 4 Ren\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>59</sup>\n\nthe euro gained value against the Swedish crown, the Norwegian crown and the British pound but fell against the Czech crown, the Polish zloty and the Swiss franc. The value of the euro against the Swedish crown averaged SEK 11.4788 over the course of the year and thus rose by around 8 %, reaching a significantly higher level than in the previous year (2022: SEK 10.6296) – with a minimum level of 11.0030 SEK (February 24) and a maximum of 11.9872 (September 18, 2023). Against the Norwegian crown, the euro picked up significantly during the year, by 13 % to NOK 11.4248 (2022: NOK 10.1026) – with a fluctuation range between NOK 10.5135 (January 2, 2023) and NOK 12.0045 (May 31, 2023). The euro also gained ground against the British pound: the exchange rate over the course of the year averaged GBP 0.86979 per euro (2022: GBP 0.85276) – with a fluctuation range between GBP 0.85110 (July 11, 2023) and GBP 0.89338 (February 7, 2023). Against the Czech crown the euro averaged CZK 24.004 and was thus a good two per cent lower than in the previous year (2022: CZK 24.566) – with a fluctuation range between CZK 23.271 (April 13, 2023) and CZK 24.724 (December 29, 2023). Against the Polish zloty, the value of the euro fell slightly over the course of the year to 4.5420 zloty (2022: 4.6861 zloty) – with a fluctuation range between 4.3090 (December 15, 2023) and 4.7875 zloty (February 13, 2023). The euro lost even more ground against the Swiss franc: on average in 2023, the euro's value fell to 0.9718 francs (2022: 1.0047 francs) – with a minimum level of 0.9260 francs (December 29, 2023) and a maximum of 1.0056 francs (January 12, 2023).**1**\n\n#### **CEWE remains largely independent of cyclical trends**\n\nIn a difficult macroeconomic environment characterised by strong inflation, in the financial year 2023 CEWE was once again largely independent of cyclical trends, particularly in its Photofinishing core business unit. In the financial year 2023 CEWE was once again able to compensate for the inflation-related cost increases by raising its prices.\n\nDespite the overall rise in the cost of living and consumers' general restraint in this context, there was no decline in the level of demand for high-quality photo products, which frequently capture emotional moments. In every age group, people are finding it ever more natural to order photo products digitally.\n\n#### Photofinishing market\n\nMore photos have been created than ever before over the past few years. The number of images taken increased significantly, due to mobile devices. While 660 billion photos were taken worldwide in 2013, this number had already increased to 1,200 billion in 2017.**2** In 2023 the figure had reached 1.81 trillion photos. This corresponds to roughly 57,000 photos a second.**3**\n\nSales of smartphones in Germany, which peaked at 26.2 million units in 2015, remain at a high stable level of approx. 22 million units in 2019 and 2020. They remain stable in 2022, with around 22 million units.**2**\n\nThe number of German citizens who own smartphones continues to rise. In 2022, approx. 83 % of over 16 year-olds were smartphone users. The proportion in 2022 corresponds to an overall figure of approx. 57.4 million people.**4**\n\n96 % state that their smartphone makes their everyday life considerably easier. This represents a slight growth rate of one percentage point by comparison with the 2021 figure of 95 %. For 90 % of Germans, their smartphone is so important to them that they cannot imagine doing without it in their everyday lives. This represents an increase of two percentage points by comparison with the 2021 figure of 88 %. At the same time, smartphones are expected to become ever more important in future. Asked about what the future holds in 2030, 91 % of those questioned stated that the role of the smartphone would become even more significant, while 71 % assume that the smartphone will provide even more functions than it currently does.**4**\n\nThis trend is also reflected in the German population's interest in photography: in 2019, 8.67 million people aged 14 years or older in the German-speaking population stated that they were (particularly) interested in photography. In 2021, this figure rose to 8.93 million. In 2022, it amounted to 8.76 million.**5**\n\nA glance at the profile of people interested in photography in 2023 reveals that significantly more than half of photography enthusiasts (approx. 58 %) are in the younger age group of 18 – 39 year-olds. The over-50s also account for a large share (36 %). These figures are unchanged on 2022.

In December the business climate was then at a seasonally-adjusted level of 87.0 points and thus three percentage points lower than in the previous year. Companies in the printing industry had an even gloomier assessment of their business situation. At a level of 81.9 in December this remained clearly (around 7.0 points) below its level in the previous year. With an average index level of 81.8, sentiment in printing and media industry boardrooms thus clearly deteriorated in the final quarter of 2023 and is around 14.3 % lower than the average level for the first quarter. The key factors here were a difficult order situation on account of the state of the economy, the absence of a macroeconomic recovery and ongoing cost pressure which is forcing companies to demand relatively high prices for printing products. The more optimistic assessments of the course of business at the start of the year were thus not reflected in an improvement in companies' business situations over the course of the year.\n\nWhile the procurement market for paper especially stabilised during 2023, the ongoing high cost pressure is nonetheless continuing to have a negative impact on companies' business situations. The depressed order situation is a further factor.\n\nThe rate of employment in the printing industry fell by 3.7 % overall in 2023. However, this varies a great deal, depending on the size of the company in question. For\n\nlarge companies with more than 500 employees, the rate of employment rose significantly, by 9.3 %. This points to the ongoing consolidation of the printing industry.**2**\n\n#### Retail market\n\nCompared with the previous year 2022, average annual retail turnover in 2023 fell in both the EU and the Eurozone by 1.8 %.**3**\n\nIn our view, effective integration of over-the-counter and online business is critical for success. Customers greatly appreciate the ability to pick up products and to try them out, or try them on. In an age of digitalisation, in CEWE's view ever more frequently retail outlets therefore serve as an experience venue and showroom to provide information and inspiration, while their significance as an actual pointof-sale is on the wane. In our view, over-the-counter retail feeds off local frequency and needs to develop this by means of an active product range policy, through which it meets customers' needs while suggesting shopping ideas.\n\nThe trend of rising average prices in the camera segment, which has been apparent over the past few years, continued in 2023. While compact cameras (with a built-in lens) and digital reflex cameras (DSLR) continue to decline in terms of the quantities sold, sales of higher-quality mirrorless system cameras (CSC) remain at a high level. In CEWE's view, specialist photographic retailers are benefitting particularly strongly from this trend, since they are able to provide advice for these models.\n\n→ Economic report\n\nReport 4 Remunerat\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>Results\n\n#### Group profit and loss account\n\n#### **Consolidated profit and loss account** in millions of euros\n\n|                                                                                  |     | 2022   | 2023   | Change<br>in millions<br>of euro |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|----------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                                                         | (1) | 732.7  | 780.2  | 47.5                             |\n| Increase in finished and unfinished goods                                        |     | 0.0    | 0.2    | 0.3                              |\n| Other own work capitalised                                                       | (2) | 2.9    | 4.2    | 1.3                              |\n| Other operating income                                                           | (3) | 29.2   | 25.5   | -3.7                             |\n| Cost of materials                                                                | (4) | -180.5 | -187.4 | -6.8                             |\n| Gross profit                                                                     |     | 584.2  | 622.7  | 38.5                             |\n| Personnel expenses                                                               | (5) | -202.5 | -218.9 | -16.3                            |\n| Other operating expenses                                                         | (6) | -252.8 | -266.1 | -13.3                            |\n| EBITDA                                                                           |     | 128.8  | 137.7  | 8.9                              |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment | (7) | -53.2  | -53.8  | -0.6                             |\n| EBIT                                                                             |     | 75.6   | 83.9   | 8.3                              |\n| Financial income                                                                 | (8) | 0.7    | 6.0    | 5.2                              |\n| Financial expenses                                                               | (8) | -1.5   | -1.9   | -0.4                             |\n| Financial result                                                                 |     | -0.8   | 4.0    | 4.8                              |\n| EBT                                                                              |     | 74.8   | 87.9   | 13.1                             |\n| Income taxes                                                                     | (9) | -23.7  | -28.3  | -4.6                             |\n| Earnings after tax from continuing operations                                    |     | 51.1   | 59.6   | 8.6                              |\n| Post-tax profit/loss for discontinued operation                                  |     | 0.0    | -2.3   | -2.3                             |\n| Group earnings after taxes                                                       |     | 51.1   | 57.3   | 6.2                              |\n| Group earnings per share (in euros)                                              |     |        |        |                                  |\n| Undiluted                                                                        |     | 7.20   | 8.43   | 1.23                             |\n| Diluted                                                                          |     | 7.19   | 8.42   | 1.24                             |\n\n#### **Revenues**\n\nGroup turnover (1) increased by + 6.5 % in the financial year 2023 and totalled 780.2 million euros (previous year: 732.7 million euros). Turnover has risen in the Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units. Turnover in the Retail business unit has decreased slightly, which is attributable to currency translation effects. The trend for the Group has been shaped by revenues in Photofinishing in particular, which have increased by 42.7 million euros. The Group revenues achieved are slightly above the upper end of the expected range.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the CEWE Group produced 2.39 billion photos (previous year: 2.28 billion photos). The numbers of units are thus within the predicted range. Moreover, the volume of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS increased in the year under review, at 6.05 million units (previous year: 5.85 million), and is thus even slightly higher than the predicted range.\n\n#### **Change in individual P&L items**\n\nThe significant change in other own work capitalised (2) (+ 1.3 million euros) is attributable, in particular, to the CEWE Photostations which CEWE's subsidiary Hertz Systemtechnik GmbH manufactures.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe cost of materials (4) has also increased, in line with the turnover growth. The material expense ratio has decreased by approx. 0.6 percentage points and amounts\n\nto 23.9 % in the year under review (previous year: 24.5 %).\n\nlower income from the reversal of accruals.\n\nOther operating income (3) has decreased by 3.7 million euros, or 12.6 %, by comparison with the previous year. This trend is largely explicable due to reduced income from recyclable residual materials arising during the production process in the consumables segment as well as\n\nThe CEWE Group's personnel expenses (5) rose moderately year-on-year (16.3 million euros, or 8.1 %) and amount to 218.9 million euros (previous year: 202.5 million euros). On average, the CEWE Group had 3,903 employees in 2023 (previous year: 3,816). This trend mainly reflects collective agreement pay rises as well as lower social security benefits in the form of the short-time allowance.\n\nOther operating expenses (6) likewise increased in the financial year 2023 year-on-year and at 266.1 million euros (previous year: 252.8 million euros) are higher than in the previous year, on business-related grounds. This figure represents 34.1 % of turnover (previous year: 34.5 %).\n\nDepreciation and amortisation (7) have increased by 0.6 million euros year-on-year. This mainly comprises scheduled depreciation and amortisation.\n\nThe financial result (8) has increased year-on-year. While interest expense has increased slightly over the year as a whole (2023: 1.9 million euros; 2022: 1.5 million euros), at 6.0 million euros a significant increase in financial income was achieved in the year under review (2022: 0.7 million euros).\n\nThe Group's tax rate for the reported EBT amounts to 32.2 % for the financial year 2023 and is thus slightly higher than in the previous year (31.7 %). Income taxes (9) have risen slightly and amount to 28.3 million euros in 2023 (previous year: 23.7 million euros).\n\n#### **Earnings trend**\n\nThe Group EBIT figure has increased year-on-year, in line with the development of turnover, by approx. 11.0 %, or 8.3 million euros, to 83.9 million euros (previous year: 75.6 million euros) (cf. the comments on the individual business units, **[page 67](#page-68-0)**). The EBIT figure thus exceeds the forecast range.\n\nIn line with the EBIT figure, the EBT trend was also positive year-on-year and is at 87.9 million euros 17.5 % higher than in the previous year (74.8 million euros) (cf. the comments on the individual business units **[page 67](#page-68-0)**). An EBT figure above the forecast range was thus achieved.\n\nAt EUR 59.6 million euros, in the financial year 2023 the CEWE Group realised earnings after tax from continuing operations which were 8.6 million euros higher (cf. comments on income taxes).\n\n(Undiluted) earnings per share from continuing operations amounted to 8.43 euros and thus exceeded the previous year's level (7.20 euros).\n\nEarnings of the sold subsidiary futalis, which are presented as earnings after taxes of the discontinued operation, amounted to – 2.3 million euros, compared to a balanced 0.0 million euros in the previous year. This includes a posttax operating loss of 1.8 million euros as well as a loss of 0.5 million euros due to this company's removal from the scope of consolidation.\n\nAt EUR 57.3 million euros, in the financial year 2023 the CEWE Group realised earnings after tax which were 6.2 million euros higher and has thus here too exceeded its forecast range.\n\n(Undiluted) earnings per share amounted to 8.10 euros and accordingly exceeded the previous year's level (7.20 euros) and the predicted figure.\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\nlders 3 Combined Manager\n\n→ Economic report\n\n5 **Financial Statements**\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Business units\n\n#### **2023** in millions of euros\n\n|                                | Photofinishing | Retail | Commercial<br>Online Printing | Other<br>Activities | Inter-business-<br>unit turnover1 | CEWE Group |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenues                       | 658.8          | 31.3   | 92.2                          | 0.0                 | -2.0                              | 780.5      |\n| Change on previous year (as %) | 6.9            | -3.4   | 6.6                           |                     |                                   | 6.5        |\n| Change on previous year        | 42.7           | -1.1   | 5.7                           | 0.0                 | 0.2                               | 47.5       |\n| EBIT                           | 80.0           | 0.5    | 4.2                           | -0.8                |                                   | 83.9       |\n| Change on previous year (as %) | 8.6            | 179    | 81.4                          | -37.0               |                                   | 11.0       |\n| Change on previous year        | 6.3            | 0.3    | 1.9                           | -0.2                |                                   | 8.3        |\n| EBIT margin (as %)             | 12.1           | 1.5    | 4.5                           |                     |                                   | 10.8       |\n\n#### **2022** in millions of euros\n\n|                    | Photofinishing | Retail | Commercial<br>Online Printing | Other<br>Activities | Inter-business-<br>unit turnover1 | CEWE Group |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenues           | 616.1          | 32.4   | 86.5                          | 0.0                 | -2.2                              | 732        |\n| EBIT               | 73.7           | 0.2    | 2.3                           | -0.6                |                                   | 75         |\n| EBIT margin (as %) | 12.0           | 0.5    | 2.7                           | -                   |                                   | 10         |\n\n**1** The inter-business-unit turnover relates to the consolidation of turnover between two different business units.\n\n#### Comments on the segments\n\nPhotofinishing includes turnover and earnings from CEWE photo products from own retail activities.\n\nRetail only consists of merchandise business, excl. CEWE's photography products.\n\nOther Activities comprises holding/structural costs (mainly Supervisory Board and IR costs), real estate.\n\n#### **Photofinishing**\n\nRevenues in the Photofinishing business unit increased by 42.7 million euros year-on-year to 658.8 million euros. This corresponds to a turnover increase of 6.9 %. At 80.0 million euros (previous year: 73.7 million euros), the EBIT figure for Photofinishing has made a significant contribution to the Group EBIT figure. This trend mainly reflects the continued increased volume of travel following the coronavirus period, while the inflation-related cost increases have been almost entirely compensated for.\n\n#### **Retail**\n\nRetail turnover has declined year-on-year. Revenues in the year under review amount to 31.3 million euros and are thus 1.1 million euros below those in the previous year. The EBIT figure in the Retail business unit has increased by 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros (previous year: 0.2 million euros) and thus improved slightly.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Commercial Online Printing**\n\nRevenues in the Commercial Online Printing business unit have at 92.2 million euros increased considerably by comparison with the previous year (previous year: 86.5 million euros). Things increasingly getting back to normal in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the recovery of business life resulted in a strong level of demand for printed advertising media. The strong turnover trend, together with an optimised cost structure, is also reflected in the earnings volume. The EBIT figure is at 4.2 million euros significantly higher than the previous year's figure of 2.3 million euros.\n\n#### **Other Activities**\n\nIn particular, structural and company costs as well as the result of real estate holdings and equity investments are reflected in the Other Activities business unit.\n\nThe revenues previously reported in the Other Activities business unit related to the discontinued operation futalis and are thus no longer reported there. The EBIT figure in this business unit is – 0.8 million euros and therefore slightly lower than in the previous year (– 0.6 million euros). This is attributable to structural and company costs.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nin millions of euros\n\n**Assets**\n\nTotal assets have increased year-on-year by 5.5 % and amounted to 666.0 million euros at the end of the year (previous year: 632.7 million euros).\n\n#### **Assets**\n\nOn the assets side, this trend primarily reflects an increase in property, plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents. The year-on-year decrease in current trade receivables and receivables from income tax refunds had the opposite effect on the balance sheet total.\n\nDec. 31, 2022 **Dec. 31, 2023** Change in\n\ntion 5 Finan\n\n# 6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-65-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>64</sup>\n\n| Property, plant and equipment               | 224.7 | 233.9 | 9.2   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Investment properties                       | 19.0  | 18.8  | – 0.2 |\n| Goodwill                                    | 81.8  | 81.8  | 0.0   |\n| Intangible assets                           | 24.6  | 21.3  | – 3.2 |\n| Financial assets                            | 9.7   | 6.7   | – 3.0 |\n| Non-current financial assets                | 1.0   | 0.8   | – 0.1 |\n| Non-current other receivables and assets    | 1.8   | 1.8   | 0.0   |\n| Deferred tax assets                         | 13.6  | 14.9  | 1.3   |\n| Non-current assets                          | 376.1 | 380.1 | 4.0   |\n| Inventories                                 | 59.3  | 60.5  | 1.3   |\n| Current trade receivables                   | 98.1  | 91.1  | – 7.0 |\n| Current receivables from income tax refunds | 11.1  | 1.5   | – 9.6 |\n| Current financial assets                    | 3.1   | 3.2   | 0.1   |\n| Other current receivables and assets        | 11.9  | 12.3  | 0.4   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                   | 73.1  | 117.4 | 44.3  |\n| Current assets                              | 256.6 | 285.9 | 29.3  |\n| Assets                                      | 632.7 | 666.0 | 33.3  |\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Economic report\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>65</sup>\n\n5 **Financial Statements** 6\n\nNon-current assets mainly comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, investment properties as well as deferred tax assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by 9.2 million euros year-on-year and amount to 233.9 million euros as of the reporting date. This trend is mainly due to additions which exceeded the volume of scheduled depreciation. Operational investments (outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) in the financial year 2023 amount to 51.7 million euros and are thus lower than envisaged in the forecast.\n\nIntangible assets have decreased by 3.2 million euros, or 13.2 %, on the previous year. They largely consist of customer bases, lists and trademark rights as well as acquired software. In terms of the development of the book values, this is mainly offset by additions in the amount of 8.0 million euros, including scheduled amortisation of 0.7 million euros.\n\nFinancial assets mainly comprise equity investments in venture capital funds and were reduced by 3.0 million euros, or 31.0 %, on the previous year due to the distribution of profits.\n\nOf the deferred tax assets, 6.3 million euros (previous year: 7.2 million euros) relates to loss carry-forwards and 8.6 million euros (previous year: 6.4 million euros) to temporary differences resulting from different valuations under IFRS and tax law rules for pension accruals and property, plant and equipment.\n\nCurrent assets mainly comprise current trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and inventories.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by 44.3 million euros or 60.6 % year-on-year.\n\nAs of the reporting date, current receivables from income tax refunds are 9.6 million euros lower than in the previous year. Tax prepayments were reimbursed on the basis of a tax assessment.\n\nAs of the reporting date, current trade receivables are 7.0 million euros lower than in the previous year. Improved payment methods are a key factor here. In addition, business partners' payment behaviour has a significant influence on the volume of receivables as of the reporting date.\n\nInventories increased by 2.1 %, or 1.3 million euros, in the year under review.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>**Equity and liabilities**\n\nAt the level of equity and liabilities, the increase in the balance sheet total is largely attributable to the positive trend for the CEWE Group's equity. In addition, in the current liabilities item current other liabilities and current tax liabilities have both increased. In the case of noncurrent liabilities, which have hardly changed, the increase in accruals for pensions was offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities from leasing.\n\nEquity increased by 26.5 million euros, or 7.3 %, by comparison with December 31, 2022. This growth is mainly attributable to the 51.5 million euros increase in retained earnings and unappropriated profits, driven by comprehensive income. On the other hand, the opposite effect resulted from the dividend payments made in the year under review in the amount of 17.4 million euros and the share buybacks, which are the main factor behind the 9.0 million euros increase in treasury shares at acquisition cost which are reported as a deduction from equity. The equity ratio at the end of the year was at 58.5 % higher than the previous year's level of 57.3 %, despite the balance sheet increase.\n\nCurrent trade payables rose by 0.9 million euros yearon-year. This is mainly due to the higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter, on account of operating activities as well as investments.\n\nDue to the decrease in the accounting interest rate for the calculation of pension accruals, non-current accruals for pensions have increased by 4.9 million euros or 16.7 % year-on-year.\n\n| Equity and Liabilities                             | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 | Change in<br>millions of euros |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| Subscribed capital                                 | 19.3          | 19.3          | 0.0                            |\n| Capital reserve                                    | 73.8          | 74.0          | 0.2                            |\n| Treasury shares at acquisition cost                | – 26.2        | – 34.1        | – 7.9                          |\n| Retained earnings and unappropriated profits       | 295.9         | 330.0         | 34.1                           |\n| Equity                                             | 362.8         | 389.2         | 26.5                           |\n| Non-current accruals for pensions                  | 29.1          | 34.0          | 4.9                            |\n| Non-current deferred tax liabilities               | 2.1           | 1.6           | – 0.6                          |\n| Non-current other accruals                         | 0.6           | 0.6           | 0.0                            |\n| Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | 0.1           | 0.0           | – 0.1                          |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                      | 40.5          | 37.1          | – 3.4                          |\n| Non-current financial liabilities                  | 0.7           | 0.6           | – 0.1                          |\n| Non-current other liabilities                      | 0.5           | 0.5           | 0.0                            |\n| Non-current liabilities                            | 73.7          | 74.3          | 0.6                            |\n| Current tax liabilities                            | 5.1           | 7.7           | 2.6                            |\n| Current other accruals                             | 2.7           | 3.0           | 0.4                            |\n| Current interest-bearing financial liabilities     | 0.2           | 0.1           | – 0.1                          |\n| Current lease liabilities                          | 9.7           | 9.5           | – 0.2                          |\n| Current trade payables                             | 120.6         | 121.6         | 0.9                            |\n| Current financial liabilities                      | 0.3           | 0.1           | – 0.1                          |\n| Current other liabilities                          | 57.6          | 60.5          | 2.8                            |\n| Current liabilities                                | 196.2         | 202.4         | 6.2                            |\n| Equity and liabilities                             | 632.7         | 666.0         | 33.3                           |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nCash flow\n\nincrease.\n\nHigher value-added tax liabilities at the end of the year and a higher level of wages and salaries yet to be paid out have likewise caused current other liabilities to increase, by 2.8 million euros or 4.9 %.\n\nCurrent tax liabilities increased by 2.6 million euros yearon-year and are thus in line with the positive earnings trend for the Group as a whole.\n\n## Return on capital employed\n\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) is at 18.8 % higher than in the previous year (previous year: 17.6 %). The value of 18.8 % reflects the 12-month EBIT figure of 83.9 million euros and the average volume of capital employed of 445.9 million euros over the four quarterly reporting dates in 2023. This development is attributable to the parallel increase in the 12-month EBIT figure and average capital employed.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, the CEWE Group achieved a positive cash flow from operating activities in the amount of 130.8 million euros (previous year: 93.4 million euros). Its cash flow is thus 37.4 million euros higher than in the previous year, which represents a significant\n\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities reflects several different factors. An 8.9 million euros effect is attributable to the EBITDA figure and has thus arisen due to the general course of business. A further 17.2 million euros has been induced by operating working capital and\n\nother working capital, where a decrease in trade receivables in the year under review in particular contrasts with an increase in the previous year. In the year under review 2023, net tax payments were 10.9 million euros lower than in the previous year.\n\nAt 47.9 million euros, cash outflows from investing activities in the year under review 2023 are clearly (14.0 million euros) lower than in the previous year. While in the previous year the purchase of an administrative building (9.3 million euros) and the acquisition payments (7.7 million euros) led to increased cash outflows, conversely inflows from financial investments resulted in the year under review (5.4 million euros). Operational investments adjusted for business and company acquisitions are 2.7 million euros higher than in the previous year.\n\nOverall, at 82.8 million euros free cash flow has strongly increased by comparison with the previous year (31.5 million euros), for the reasons set out above.\n\n#### **Condensed cash flow statement** in millions of euros\n\n|                                                                | 2022  | 2023  | Change<br>in millions<br>of euros |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities                            | 93.4  | 130.8 | +37.4                             |\n| Cash flow from investing activities                            | -61.9 | -47.9 | +14.0                             |\n| Free cash flow                                                 | 31.5  | 82.8  | +51.4                             |\n| Cash flow from financing activities                            | -42.6 | -38.9 | +3.7                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the reporting period | 84.4  | 73.1  | -11.3                             |\n| Net change in cash and cash equivalents                        | -11.1 | 43.9  | +55.1                             |\n| Exchange-rate-related change in cash and cash equivalents      | -0.2  | 0.4   | +0.5                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period   | 73.1  | 117.4 | +44.3                             |\n\nMoreover, cash outflows from financing activities decreased slightly and amounted to 38.9 million euros, compared to 42.6 million euros in the previous year. In the year under review 2023, in particular the dividend paid in the amount of 17.3 million euros (previous year: 16.6 million euros), the acquisition of treasury shares in the amount of 9.0 million euros (previous year: 13.7 million euros) and the outflows resulting from the change in financial liabilities in the amount of 12.1 million euros (previous year: 11.5 million euros) resulted in cash outflows.\n\nWith its available financial resources, CEWE was able at all times to fulfil its liquidity requirements which arose over the course of the year due to the seasonal nature of its business, as usual.

CEWE achieves a stronger level of value creation with these value-added products, which consumers purchase from various business partners and also directly from CEWE. The company's preparations for its Christmas business over the course of the first ten months of each year entail very high \"outlays\". Here too, CEWE thus has the opportunity to realise a slightly increased margin. CEWE sees the use of smartphones as\n\na fully-fledged camera plus an ordering device as representing an opportunity, and every part of the company is adapting to this trend.\n\nAs outlined in the description of the related business model, Retail plays a key role in this trend, but not primarily in the photographic hardware business (whose development is reported in the Retail business unit). Its locations increasingly serve as a distribution channel for photofinishing products (which are reported in the Photofinishing business unit) – here too, directly to consumers. This is reflected in the rising level of turnover involving photofinishing products which are sold via the Retail business unit, through CEWE's online stores or its branches.\n\nCommercial Online Printing is CEWE's third business unit. In CEWE's view, thanks to highly automated and highly efficient production at SAXOPRINT in Dresden, CEWE has a good chance of further success in this market.\n\nAt the start of 2024, CEWE's business development continued to match the Board of Management's expectations. All in all, this has strengthened the Board of Management's resolve in terms of the targets which it has indicated for the financial year 2024 in the \"Report on expected developments\" chapter **[see Report on expected developments,](#page-73-0)  [pages 72 ff](#page-73-0)**.\n\n# Events after the balance sheet date\n\n## Events of particular significance after the balance sheet date\n\nThe potential effects of the continued inflation and the related impact on CEWE's course of business have been factored into the forecast, opportunities and risk report on the basis of the information currently available.\n\nIn order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 CEWE's subsidiary SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden, via an asset deal. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. No other events of particular significance have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk report\n\n**opportunities**\n\nfication are also documented. Corresponding measures are likewise taken into consideration for risk assessment purposes. A net risk assessment is thus also implemented. The German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) which was revised in the summer of 2022 places a particularly strong emphasis on sustainable corporate governance.\n\nTaking opportunities and the ability to identify and analyse risks and to reduce, avoid or transfer them via suitable strategies are key aspects of CEWE's corporate activities. The Board of Management is continuously tasked with systematic management of risks and opportunities. This is a management task in each of its areas of responsibility.\n\n**Management's overall assessment of risks and** \n\nRisks and opportunities are regularly separately identified and outlined. They are assessed quantitatively together with an evaluation of their impact. The impact and the assumed probability of realisation are combined to produce the expected risk score. The related measures are registered for the purpose of risk management; finally, the indicators implemented for the purpose of early identi-\n\nSustainability refers here to environmental (ecological) and social goals. This means that these goals must be an integral part of strategies, planning and operational processes. They are thus likewise an integral component of the risk management system, the compliance management system and the internal control system. CEWE is committed to these goals.\n\nA major event may mean that the effects of individual risks are amplified through their combination or interaction with one another or else these risks' impact upon one another. During the coronavirus pandemic, CEWE gave particular consideration to this in its risk assessment and evaluation. The specific coronavirus risk once again significantly decreased year-on-year, in line with the evolution of the pandemic. It is currently considered in the context of a more broadly defined pandemic risk.\n\nThe Board of Management's regular risk assessment within the scope of the risk management process and the risk inventory as of December 31, 2023 has established that individual risks – or risks arising in conjunction with others – do not point to any impairment of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the CEWE Group in a manner which would jeopardise its existence.\n\nIrrespective of their economic significance, multi-layered risks associated with sustainability requirements, cyber risks, risks associated with the high pace and density of regulation and risks relating to an adequate supply of qualified specialists and executives are a priority for CEWE. This represents a particularly strong area of its management activities.\n\nIn particular, cyber risk, staff turnover risk, the risks associated with technical infrastructure and, in the field of legal risks, risk associated with the high density and pace of regulation were given a higher priority than in the previous year.\n\nCEWE continues to expect that the Ukraine conflict will not have any direct impact on its business, either in terms of procurement or sales. At the present time, there are still no indications of any negative influence on consumer sentiment and thus on the development of turnover.\n\nThe following section initially sets out the key risk categories within the scope of its risk management system:\n\n#### **Strategic risks**\n\nThe core business units of Photofinishing, Commercial Online Printing and Retail entail strategic risks.\n\nIn our core business, the key strategic risks comprise the technology and innovation risk, the risks associated with the CEWE brand and the risk relating to the development of the mobile photofinishing market. In response to the change associated with mobile devices and the key importance of the Internet as an ordering channel, CEWE has reinforced its programming and development capacities in this area. The technology and innovation risk is countered above all via strategic partnerships with research institutions, regular market analyses and monitoring of the competitive environment. Consumer-oriented brand communication, continuous brand reinforcement and effective and efficient crisis management limit the potential risks associated with the CEWE brand.\n\nForecast, opportunities and risk report\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\ntion E.

Consistent price controlling plays a key role in all of CEWE's activities in relation to price risk.\n\nAs a rule, the technical infrastructure is safeguarded by means of IT structures standardised throughout the Group, high-availability technologies, back-up data centres as well as back-up connections for the transmission of data. Virus and access protection as well as encryption systems are important technologies which protect against unauthorised external and internal access. Production capacities are likewise safeguarded through redundant processes at various locations. The possibility of central management of capacities also plays a key role. We are certainly aware of the general risk associated with the supply and procurement of materials, but do not consider this to be particularly significant. In all procurement lines, a multiple-supplier strategy and multiple-year contracts are considered to be adequate measures.\n\nCyber risks are significant for CEWE's business model and have a particularly strong weighting. This mainly relates to general attacks on vulnerabilities in the software products which CEWE uses, hacker attacks specifically targeting CEWE as well as attacks on the data links between CEWE and its customers. CEWE is continuously working on technical and organisational improvements within the scope of its IT systems in order to tackle these risks. It is continuing to increase its volume of personnel in the area of IT security, improving existing contingency plans on an\n\nongoing basis and embedding these in other contingency plans. Finally, awareness-raising and training play an important role within the company as a whole.\n\nIn the area of environmental risk, no violations of environmental standards were identified in 2023. This risk is monitored by means of regular internal checks at all of the company's production plants; it is classified as low.\n\nThe risk associated with recruiting and retaining qualified specialists and executives is more significant indirectly rather than directly. The presence of the CEWE umbrella brand also plays an important role in the labour market here. Closely supported by the company's management, initial and advanced training are consistently offered and cover employees' specialist fields as well as personal and leadership skills. The management focuses particularly strongly on retention of staff.\n\n#### **Financial risks**\n\nThe risks resulting from interest rate changes, currency fluctuations, the supply of credit, the risk associated with the resale of recyclable residual materials arising during the production process and the risk of default fall within the scope of CEWE's financial risks and do not jeopardise its existence. Due to the low level of interest-bearing debt funding and the high volume of cash and cash equivalents resulting from the seasonal business trend, even a strong rise in market interest rates would not represent a threat. Where capital flows occur outside of the Eurozone, they almost entirely relate to local business which is handled in the same currency, so that exchange-rate fluctuations do not have any significant negative impact. The CEWE Group's long-term supply of credit is safeguarded\n\nby means of centrally negotiated medium- to long-term credit agreements.\n\nThe risk of default is continuing to decline in significance due to the constant growth in the volume of consumer business too. Receivables from business partners are closely monitored and are subject to normal and adequate insurance arrangements. Consumer receivables do not in themselves constitute a risk and are covered by a professional debt collection management system.\n\nOther receivables apply in relation to the public sector, employees and insurance firms etc. Here too, the risk of potential loss-related impairment is of minor significance. This risk is reduced by means of continuous monitoring of debtors' credit ratings and payment behaviour, in close coordination with all of the company's affected departments. Any applicable individual risks are always taken into consideration by means of adequate valuation adjustments, insofar as the realisation of this loss is sufficiently probable.\n\n#### **Legal risks**\n\nLegal risks include internal and external malicious acts as well as risks associated with data protection and industrial property rights. These risks are covered by means of measures and processes within the scope of the company's rigorous corporate governance system, its internal control system, internal auditing as well as its Group controlling function. The company is aware of the challenges associated with the high density and pace of regulation, monitors these issues in detail and pursues an effective management strategy in order to actively counter these risks. In addition, information and training sessions are regularly held in order to identify risks and implement measures.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\nent Report 4 Remunera\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>71</sup>\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, the BEPS Pillar 2 rules (German Act Transposing the Minimum Tax Directive, Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – MinBestRL-UmsG) were transposed into German law (German Act on Minimum Taxation, Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG) and entered into force upon publication in the German Federal Law Gazette on December 27, 2023. The provisions of the Act on Minimum Taxation apply for the first time for financial years beginning after December 30, 2023 and are therefore not yet applicable for the year under review. Even if these provisions had already been applicable, the CEWE Group would not have fallen under the scope of the Min-StG or foreign acts on minimum taxation either in the year under review or in the financial year 2024, since the turnover threshold of 750 million euros in the consolidated financial statements for application of these provisions was exceeded for the first time in the year under review. This notwithstanding, CEWE expects to once again exceed the relevant turnover threshold in the financial year 2024 and thus assumes that the provisions of the MinStG will apply for the first time for the financial year 2025.\n\nIn the financial year 2024, the CEWE Group will therefore commence a project reviewing the impact in terms of the effects associated with a Pillar 2 top-up tax. It is not currently possible to quantity the potential additional tax burden. However, application of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation are not currently expected to lead to a significant additional tax burden, since the CEWE Group operates almost exclusively in countries whose nominal income tax burden exceeds 15 % and for which no tax burden at all, or only an insignificant tax burden, is therefore expected to arise.\n\nThe CEWE Group is closely monitoring the progress of the legislative process in every country where it operates. It will adapt its current reporting and compliance processes with a view to future local and central determination of the top-up tax burden as well as the future submission of a minimum tax report and filing of related tax returns in Germany and other countries.\n\n#### Report on opportunities\n\nThe CEWE Group's risks and opportunities management systems are closely integrated. Possible future developments or events which may result in a positive deviation from planning are seen as opportunities.\n\nWith its business units, CEWE operates in dynamic market segments which are enjoying rapid growth. Exploiting opportunities in these business units by means of innovation, consolidation or organic growth and identifying further opportunities in adjacent and related new business units while avoiding unnecessary risks serve as the foundations of the CEWE Group's long-term growth. Opportunities may entail both internal and external potential.\n\nOpportunities whose realisation is probable have been factored into CEWE's corporate planning and outlook for 2024. This report on opportunities therefore relates to events which may potentially give rise to a positive deviation from these planning figures.\n\nCEWE sees management of opportunities as a core aspect of its corporate activities. Identifying, weighing up and\n\nseizing opportunities is a key and ongoing management task. Management of opportunities thus includes documentation of concepts and minutes of meetings.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Photofinishing business unit**\n\nCEWE sees opportunities in terms of increased income due to the additional turnover provided by new or improved ordering applications for mobile devices, should these gain even stronger acceptance among end-consumers.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Commercial Online Printing business unit**\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, in its Commercial Online Printing business unit CEWE focused even more strongly on the efficiency of its customer-related processes and its cost structures. Following the end of the coronavirus pandemic and the winding-down of governments' coronavirus measures, to some extent general business life has already recovered and the level of demand for business stationery and printed advertising media thus strengthened. This offers further opportunities to achieve turnover and income beyond the scope of the current planning, particularly in the context of long-term cost efficiency.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Retail business unit**\n\nCEWE operates photo retail stores through its own Retail operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In principle, it aims to further optimise its Retail presence through its own stores on the market, in line with end-consumers' purchasing behaviour. In Norway, Sweden and Poland, CEWE has established online stores for photography-related articles. Optimisation of these stores is expected to generate opportunities for further turnover increases and income in the online segment.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nCEWE at a Glance\n\nrisk report\n\ngement Report 4 Remune\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n<span id=\"page-73-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>72</sup>\n\n## Report on expected developments\n\n#### **Three different components of long-term business development**\n\nCEWE is continuing to pursue the ongoing development of the CEWE Group on the basis of the following three strategic priorities:\n\n#### (1) Strengthening the company's brand and innovation leadership in its Photofinishing core business unit\n\nIn its Photofinishing business unit, in addition to its core markets of Germany, Switzerland and Austria as an omnichannel provider CEWE continues to focus on expanding its brands positioned in the premium segment in all of the other European countries supplied by CEWE. The goal is to exploit the positive consumer response and strong brand profile for the benefit of CEWE in general. The product differentiation advantages that are associated with the performance and quality standards which these brands stand for will be progressively exploited for a growing product portfolio. Besides the CEWE brand, the other brands of the CEWE Group – in particular, Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and WhiteWall – address specific customer groups and/or regions or offer specific product categories.\n\nCEWE's products and services undergo continuous development. Innovations already served as the key source of momentum in the analogue/digital transformation. The company endeavours to keep up this innovation momentum, in all of its business units, in order to further consolidate\n\n**1** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff. **2** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff. **3** Deutsche Bundesbank Monthly Report 1/2024: p. 5\n\nits leading market position. For example, this includes extensive software updates, the ongoing development of mobile applications and various new products and product improvements.\n\n#### (2) Profitable growth in Commercial Online Printing\n\nAt CEWE, Commercial Online Printing offers the customer a series of advantages: increased quality and price advantages from state-of-the-art printing capacities, and also time savings thanks to user-friendly Internet ordering as well as fast production and rapid delivery. CEWE considers itself very well placed here in order to achieve the successful ongoing development of its Commercial Online Printing business unit, particularly thanks to what is, in the Board of Management's view, SAXOPRINT's highly-efficient and cost-optimised printing plant in Dresden.\n\n#### (3) Development of business units\n\nAbove all, when it comes to potential investment opportunities the CEWE Group is particularly interested in online business models which – just like CEWE – produce customised, high-quality products with a substantial customer benefit and thus build a strong brand, while offering the potential of further developing the CEWE Group's business in future. Growth encompassing new fields of business should thus ideally draw upon the Group's existing areas of expertise.\n\n#### **Continuing focus on Europe**\n\nAlmost all of CEWE's business is located in Europe. At the present time, the company is not planning any changes in its regional presence.\n\n#### **Overall economic environment in 2024: global economic growth slower than average in period since 2000**\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a 3.1 % rate of global growth in 2024 and 3.2 % in 2025. However, the expected pace of growth is lower than the 3.8 % historical growth rates seen in the period from 2000 to 2019. In the IMF's view, this is due to the central banks' increased key interest rates to combat inflation, reduced fiscal support in view of the high level of debt and weak underlying productivity growth. In the developed economies, at 1.5 % in 2024 and 1.8 % in 2025 the pace of growth will be significantly lower than global growth momentum. In the IMF's assessment, the Eurozone will grow even more slowly: following a rate of 0.5 % in 2023, it will grow by 0.9 % in 2024 and by 1.7 % in 2025. According to the IMF, this reflects increased household consumer spending, falling energy prices, lower inflation levels and real income growth. For Germany, the IMF predicts growth of 0.5 % (2024) and 1.6 % (2025).**1**\n\nInflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, since the supply-side problems are resolving themselves and monetary policy is likely to be less restrictive. In the IMF's view, aggregate global inflation will fall from 6.8 % in 2023 to 5.8 % in 2024 and 4.4 % in 2025.**2**\n\n#### **Assessment of CEWE's management regarding the overall economic conditions in 2024**\n\nIn 2023 CEWE remained resilient despite the weak economic environment in Germany, with a – 0.3 % fall in its gross domestic product.**3** As in 2022, in the year under review\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nt Report 4 Remuneratio\n\nformation\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\nCEWE was able to compensate for inflation by means of price increases. Contrary to consumer sentiment which generally stagnated, demand for individual, high-quality photo products continued to increase. The management is confident that its core Photofinishing business unit will continue to develop positively in 2024. High-quality photo products which in many cases reflect emotional moments appear to be among the products which consumers are not prepared to do without, despite generally somewhat weak consumer sentiment. Thanks to CEWE PHOTOBOOK and its other brand products and its strong Internet expertise, as in previous years CEWE considers itself well placed to actively promote this process of ongoing change in its product mix, away from simple photo prints to value-added products such as photo books, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and other photo gifts. The upshot of this is that this trend of value-added products should continue to strengthen Photofinishing in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, the Retail business unit is expected to once again provide a significant turnover contribution through sales of CEWE photo products. Turnover and earnings for these photofinishing products – which CEWE distributes through its own retail operations – are reported in the Photofinishing business unit. In 2024, as it has done for some years now CEWE will in all likelihood continue to deliberately reduce the hardware turnover which is reported in the Retail business unit and which comprises cameras, lenses, photo equipment etc.\n\nWith its highly efficient automated production system which realises large economies of scale, the Board of Management considers that Commercial Online Printing is well prepared for the financial year 2024. This business unit is expected to continue to develop positively in 2024. The company's best-price strategy for business customers is clearly paying off in terms of growing customer confidence and thus increased loyalty.\n\n#### **Compensating for inflation will remain a goal in 2024**\n\nIn the past two years, CEWE has succeeded in balancing the inflation-driven cost increases on the expense side with its own price increases on the turnover/income side, thus compensating absolutely for the former. In 2024, CEWE will continuously analyse the inflation trend and thus the increased cost burden which this represents for the company and will seek to offset this as far as possible through price adjustments implemented in a cautious and balanced manner.\n\n#### **Solid financial position provides scope for action**\n\nWe envisage that in 2024 CEWE's operational strength will continue to enable it to fund investments in organic growth and its annual dividend payment out of its operating cash flow alone.\n\n#### **War in Ukraine still not expected to affect CEWE**\n\nTo date, the war in Ukraine has not had any direct impact on CEWE's business, either in terms of procurement or sales. At the present time, there are still no indications of any negative impact on consumer sentiment and thus on the development of turnover. However, CEWE's planning for 2024 does not reflect the possible effects of a potential escalation of the Ukraine war – above all, on consumer sentiment.\n\n**EBIT earnings target range in 2024: 77 to 87 million euros** On average, Group turnover will continue to increase in 2024, from 780.2 million euros in the previous year, 2023, to between 770 million euros and 820 million euros. In 2024, Group EBIT will fall within a range of between 77 million euros and 87 million euros, the EBT figure will amount to between 75.5 million euros and 85.5 million euros, while earnings after tax will lie within a range of 51 million euros to 58 million euros.\n\nThe ranges for these targets for the financial year 2024 represent approximate projected figures and reflect the current uncertainties associated with the increase in prices/inflation from the point of view of costs, and the cost of sales, and their potential impact on CEWE's course of business. In its operational planning for 2024, the Board of Management aims to achieve a target in the upper half of the envisaged range.\n\nThe operational investments planned for 2024 (i.e. outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) are expected to be around 65 million euros or less.\n\n#### **Goal is for continuous further dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE considers itself an extremely reliable dividend payer. The dividend proposed for 2023 represents a 15th consecutive increase. In general, CEWE pursues the goal of dividend continuity. Where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities, this means a dividend which is at least unchanged in absolute terms, and ideally an increased dividend. This policy clearly focuses on the absolute dividend value, with the payout ratio or the dividend yield as a secondary element.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\n#### **Targets for 2024 CEWE Group**\n\n|                             |                   | 2024         | Change as % |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Photos                      | billion units     | 2.3 to 2.4   | -2 to +     |\n| CEWE PHOTOBOOK              | million units     | 5.9 to 6.2   | -2 to +     |\n| Operational investments 1   | millions of euros | ~65          |             |\n| Turnover                    | millions of euros | 770 to 820   | -1 to +     |\n| EBIT                        | millions of euros | 77 to 87     | -8 to +     |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT) | millions of euros | 75.5 to 85.5 | -14 to -    |\n| Earnings after taxes        | millions of euros | 51 to 58     | - 10 to +   |\n| Earnings per share          | euros/share       | 7.26 to 8.22 | - 10 to +   |\n\n**1** Outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excl. business and company acquisitions\n\n*In this annual report, CEWE is publishing a combined management report for the CEWE Group and for the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Fin\n\n6 Further Information\n\n## Internal control and risk management system\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe company strongly emphasises compliance in terms of measures to ensure conformity with applicable legislation and internal policies and their observance by the Group's companies. The Board of Management of the general partner has implemented various mechanisms in line with its responsibilities in this respect, which are intended to ensure optimal fulfilment of these compliance requirements.\n\nThe Compliance Officer appointed for this issue continuously addresses the maintenance and development of the compliance structure of the company and the Group, in line with applicable requirements and the needs of the company. In particular, his activities focus on training for employees and on legal risk management. He reports to the CEO of the general partner. In case of any specific issues, the Compliance Officer will consult the persons with responsibility in the company's respective divisions and obtain external legal advice, where necessary.\n\nThe company has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudsman. Employees and also third parties may contact this person to point out possible violations of the law or policy violations within Group companies. Four reports were filed with the ombudsman in the reporting period. These were investigated. However, no relevant violations were determined.\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code (\"GCGC\") requires disclosures concerning internal control and risk management which exceed the statutory requirements for a management report and have thus been excluded from the auditor's audit of the management report (\"non-management report disclosures\"). These are included as part of the management declaration; moreover, they are set apart by means of separate paragraphs from the disclosures which are to be audited.\n\n#### Risk management system\n\n#### **Goals and strategy of the risk management system**\n\nAs an internationally operative business group, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks which may adversely affect their business activities as well as their net assets, financial position and results of operations. Accordingly, in compliance with industry standards and statutory provisions CEWE has established an internal control and risk management system for identification and assessment of potential opportunities and risks and, where necessary, implementation of appropriate countermeasures. This control and risk management system is incorporated within the information and communication system of the CEWE Group as an integral part of its business, planning, accounting and control processes and is a key element of the CEWE\n\nGroup's management system. Its control and risk management system is based on a systematic risk identification, assessment and management process for the overall Group. CEWE is continuously improving its risk management system. That includes its ongoing dovetailing with the company's internal control system and other management systems.\n\nAs a function which identifies risks at an early stage, monitors them on an ongoing basis and contributes to risk control, risk management forms part of the second line of CEWE's integrated governance, risk and compliance approach.\n\n#### **Organisation and structure of the risk management system**\n\nThe Board of Management, the managers of the company's regional profit centres in Germany and other countries and its central departments and project managers are responsible for its control and risk management system. The Board of Management has overall responsibility for the handling of control and risk management. From a functional point of view, the Board of Management has transferred to the Group's risk management personnel operational implementation of monitoring, coordination and ongoing development tasks within the scope of risk management processes.\n\nThe risk management system covers the risks and opportunities associated with the individual risk areas, within the scope of an annual, Group-wide risk inventory. The\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remur\n\n→ Internal control and risk management system\n\nannual report on risks and opportunities has been produced on the basis of the risk inventory. In the course of a year, the company's risk and opportunity assessments are reviewed at least quarterly. The Supervisory Board is notified of these assessments at least quarterly. Following notification of the risk officer, new risks and opportunities are incorporated in the risk management system and assigned to a risk manager. In addition to the regular processes, ad hoc risks can be registered and reported at any time where situations suddenly arise. Corresponding measures are likewise taken into consideration for risk assessment purposes. A net risk assessment is thus also implemented.\n\n#### **Key features of the internal control system**\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) is an integral component of the business processes of the CEWE Group. The goal is for all operating units where risks may arise and must be managed to be able to identify such risks at an early stage through internal controls and to deal with them. This system is intended to ensure compliance with external and internal requirements. The internal control system thus represents the first line of the integrated management approach. It encompasses a variety of different monitoring and control mechanisms and is essentially based on five principles:\n\n- Dual-control principle\n- Signature guidelines\n- IT authorisation concept\n- Separation of functions\n- Integrated reporting\n\nThe dual-control principle is safeguarded by means of rules and regulations such as articles of association, policies, rules of procedure, instructions and powers of representation and authorisations to sign. The operationally effective signature guidelines are an important aspect of these rules and regulations. The CEWE Group's coordinated IT authorisation concept is a further management and control mechanism. This regulates the activities of individual persons and groups of persons and their access to the Group's generally SAP-based applications and their functional competences.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of procedures and thus the quality of individual processes, the CEWE Group maintains a strict separation of functions for critical business processes. In addition, specific departments handle central tasks and thus have reciprocal responsibility for supervision of the Group's activities. The integrated reporting system comprises a detailed planning, management and reporting concept covering the Group's current position and its outlook. The planning process is based on a combined bottom-up and top-down approach, in line with monthly planned figures. The existing Group information system relies on a monthly target/actual/prior-year comparison as well as supplementary multiple-location business reviews at the level of the individual profit centres and at Group level. Developments, risks, opportunities and measures are discussed there and documented accordingly.\n\nThe CEWE Group also monitors the fair value of its interests in subsidiaries within the scope of its control and risk management system. Its shareholdings undergo regular as well as ad hoc impairment tests.\n\nMoreover, as the third line of our integrated management approach all of the Group's companies and profit centres regularly undergo specialised, in-depth audits covering the areas of finance and accounting, IT, technical security and insurance policies as well as other functional competences. These audits are carried out by external or internal specialists.\n\n#### **Key aspects of the internal control system, in relation to the Group accounting process**\n\nThe accounting-related internal control system is embedded within the company-wide risk management system, as a component of the overall internal control system (ICS) of the CEWE Group. Its purpose is to minimise the risk of a material misstatement in the company's accounting and external reporting, to identify undesirable developments early on and to implement countermeasures. This ensures that the Group's affairs are presented in compliance with applicable legislation and standards in separate financial statements and in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuner\n\n→ Internal control and risk management system\n\nThe \"Group balance sheets\" unit, central Finance division, is responsible for preparing the consolidated financial statements including any consolidation measures. The preparation process for the financial statements of the CEWE Group is based on a uniform Group accounting policy which is regularly adjusted in line with applicable legal outline conditions. The Board of Management has sole responsibility in relation to this accounting policy.\n\nThe Group's accounting policy sets out its IFRS accounting standards for all of the Group's companies, in Germany and in other countries, to ensure the application of uniform recognition, measurement and reporting methods for its IFRS consolidated financial statements. Binding instructions have been laid down in relation to internal reconciliations and other tasks for preparation of the financial statements. All key dates have been specified throughout the Group in the Group's policy.\n\nThe local companies are responsible for compliance with the relevant rules and are supported and monitored by the Group Accounting unit. The Group Accounting unit handles consolidation of the separate financial statements of the Group companies – which are mainly prepared using SAP – centrally by means of a specific consolidation module.\n\nThe necessary work steps within the scope of the accounting process undergo a large number of automatic and manual checks and plausibility reviews. In addition, the effectiveness of accounting-related internal checks is continuously monitored through internal auditing. This task is handled by internal auditors as well as external auditors appointed by the company. A rolling process ensures that all of the companies within the scope of consolidation undergo this supervisory process. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are regularly notified of the results of these effectiveness reviews.\n\nThe separate financial statements included within the consolidated financial statements are audited by various local auditors. Compliance with applicable accounting rules and regulations and the accuracy and completeness of all other locally produced documents which are relevant for the consolidated financial statements are thus safeguarded. The external auditor of the consolidated financial statements summarises audit findings at the level of the separate financial statements and the consolidated financial statements regarding the effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system of the CEWE Group and notifies the Supervisory Board accordingly.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Acquisition-related disclosures\n\ngement Report 4 RE\n\n# <span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>Acquisition-related disclosures\n\n## Disclosures in accordance with § 289a and 315a HGB\n\n#### **Composition of subscribed capital, restrictions relating to voting rights or the transfer of shares**\n\nThe subscribed capital of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA, Oldenburg, as far as the company is aware no specific requirements apply in relation to the possibility of their exercise of voting rights. Employees are not known to have any joint holdings of one or more shares (§ 69 (1) AktG), and nor are any voting trust agreements between employee shareholders known of.\n\n#### **Statutory regulations and provisions in the company's articles of association regarding the appointment and removal from office of members of the Board of Management and amendments of the articles of association**\n\nThe company's general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, Oldenburg, is authorised to manage the affairs of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and to represent it (§ 8 of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA). Unless imperatively stipulated in the articles of association or by law, the legal relationships between the company and its general partner will be regulated in a separate agreement; the company shall be represented\n\nby the Supervisory Board in this respect. § 9 of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA provides for the withdrawal of the company's general partner. Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung thus assumes this role irrespective of any capital contribution; but the imperative statutory grounds for the withdrawal of the general partner remain unaffected (§ 9 (1) of the articles of association). It will not be entitled to any credit balance in case of partition in the event of its withdrawal (§9 (2) of the articles of association). In the event of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung's withdrawal from its position as the company's general partner or if its withdrawal is foreseeable, to prevent the liquidation of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, § 9 (3) includes the following provision: the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is entitled and obliged immediately/as of this withdrawal to appoint a company limited by shares – which are held in their entirety by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA – as the new general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA with a sole authorisation for management of its business and a sole power of representation (clause 1). Should Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung withdraw from its position as the company's general partner without the simultaneous appointment of a new general partner, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's limited shareholders will assume the continuing management of the company on a temporary basis (clause 2). In this case, the Supervisory Board shall\n\nimmediately apply to the competent court for the appointment of a substitute representative to represent the company up to the appointment of a new general partner, particularly in the event that CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA need first acquire or establish a company limited by shares to serve as its general partner (clause 3). The Supervisory Board is authorised to adjust the wording of the articles of association in accordance with the replacement of the company's general partner (clause 4).\n\nNeumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is represented by its Board of Management in and out of court. Its Board of Management is thus also responsible for the management of the business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. The members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung are appointed by the Board of Trustees. A member of the Board of Management may be appointed by the beneficiaries of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung designated in its articles of association. The members of the Board of Management will be appointed for a term of office of up to five years. The Board of Trustees shall rule on any issues pertaining to service regulations.\n\nThe relevant statutory provisions (§§ 179 ff., 285 (2) and 181 AktG) apply in relation to any changes to the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Acquisition-related disclosures\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n#### **Powers of the Board of Management to issue and to repurchase shares**\n\nThe general meeting held on May 31, 2017 had authorised the buyback of treasury shares for up to 10 % of the share capital as of the date of this resolution, in the period up to May 30, 2022. At the general meeting held on June 15, 2022, this authorisation was renewed for the period up to the expiry of June 14, 2027. This authorisation was granted\n\n- in order to resell the shares over the stock exchange or by means of an offer submitted to all of the shareholders, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and while complying with the principle of equal treatment (§ 53a AktG).\n- the retirement of the shares, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, with the consent of the Supervisory Board. The fact or the procedure of these shares' retirement will not require a further resolution to be passed by the general meeting. These shares may therefore be called in through simplified procedures, without any capital reduction, by adjusting the pro rata notional value of the other no-par value shares in the company's share capital.\n- to dispose of the shares, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, in return for a payment in kind; in particular, these shares may be offered or granted to third parties within the scope of company mergers or at the acquisition of companies.\n- to offer the shares for purchase to employees of the company or its affiliates within the meaning of §§ 15 ff. AktG, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, or to promise these shares or transfer them with a lockup period of not less than one year; the treasury shares may also be promised and transferred to eligible persons in fulfilment of dividend claims arising from shares of the company;\n- with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to offer the shares for purchase to employees including the members of the Board of Management and the management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung within the scope of a stock option plan. In this case, the waiting period is four years. The Supervisory Board will specify the details of share-based remuneration for the members of the Board of Management;\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the general partner is authorised to grant purchased treasury shares to members of the Board of Management of the general partner as a variable remuneration component.\n\n#### **Material agreements which are subject to a change of control due to a takeover offer**\n\nThe financing agreements concluded with the company's key bank partners include the usual change-of-control provisions; these may entail the need for the amendment, supplementation or revision of the existing credit agreements. Otherwise, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, does not have any agreements with third parties which are subject to a change of control due to a takeover offer and which may have the following effects, either individually or in their totality.\n\n#### **Compensation agreements**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, does not have any agreements which have been concluded with members of the Board of Management or the management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung or employees, to cover the event of a takeover offer and which may lead to an obligation for the company to provide compensation or other payments.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion euros to 113.3 million euros (previous year: 105.5 million euros). The personnel expense ratio amounted to\n\nAnnual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\n→ Annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\nResults of operations, asset and financial position\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nThe operating business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is only one part of the business activities of the overall CEWE Group. The following paragraphs only refer to the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\nRevenues increased by 26.4 million euros to 401.9 million euros in the financial year 2023. This was mainly due to higher turnover in the Photofinishing business unit in Germany. The development of turnover year-on-year is attributable to both price and volume effects.\n\nOther operating income decreased by 0.7 million euros, from 7.9 million euros in the previous year to 7.2 million euros. This corresponds to 1.8 % of turnover (previous year: 2.1 %), due to lower income from the reversal of accruals and valuation adjustments on receivables.\n\nThe material expense ratio declined slightly, by 0.4 percentage points to 24.8 % (previous year: 25.2 %). In absolute terms, the cost of materials has increased to 99.6 million euros (previous year: 49.6 million euros), analogously to the turnover growth.\n\nAccordingly, personnel expenses also increased, by 7.8\n\n28.2 %, an increase of just 0.1 percentage points (previous year: 28.1 %). This growth is mainly attributable to collective agreement pay rises as well as an increase in the workforce.\n\nDue to investments, depreciation and amortisation have decreased by 2.7 million euros on the previous year to 23.4 million euros (previous year: 20.7 million euros).\n\nOther operating expenses increased significantly, by 16.6 million euros to 131.0 million euros (previous year: 114.4 million euros). In proportion to turnover they likewise increased by 2.1 percentage points to 32.6 % (previous year: 30.5 %). This increase is chiefly due to the sale of futalis, which resulted in a loss of 10.3 million euros and higher selling expenses.\n\nThe financial result has risen from 9.6 million euros in the previous year to 15.1 million euros. This is mainly due to the higher volume of earnings provided by affiliates as well as other equity investments.\n\nEarnings before income taxes have decreased year-on-year to the current 57.1 million euros (previous year: 58.1 million euros) and amount to 14.2 % of turnover (previous year: 15.5 %).\n\nDespite the lower earnings before tax figure, tax expenses have increased slightly to 20.1 million euros (previous year: 19.4 million euros), with a higher income tax ratio.\n\nNet income for the year amounts to 36.7 million euros (previous year: 38.5 million euros), with a post-tax profitto-turnover ratio of 9.1 % (previous year: 10.3 %).\n\n## Asset position\n\nCEWE-KGaA's total assets rose by 62.0 million euros on the previous year to 717.9 million euros.\n\nThe proportion of fixed assets has increased. At 334.3 million euros, it is 14.6 million euros higher than in the previous year (previous year: 319.6 million euros). This is principally due to the expansion of the company's production plant in Eschbach.\n\nCurrent assets have increased by 47.1 million euros to 378.2 million euros. This mainly reflects the 54.2 million euros rise in cash and cash equivalents to 101.9 million euros and, conversely, the 10.8 million euros decrease in receivables and other assets to 250.0 million euros. Inventories are at 22.7 million euros (previous year: 21.8 million euros) 3.6 million euros higher than in the previous year.\n\nEquity has increased overall by 11.4 million euros to 377.4 million euros, due to the unappropriated profits realised less the dividend paid in the financial year 2023 for 2022 and the purchase of treasury shares, with an equity ratio of 52.6 % (previous year: 55.8 %).

KGaA\n\nThe development of accruals has been shaped, in particular, by the accruals for pensions, which have increased by 3.1 million euros year-on-year to 33.3 million euros.\n\nLiabilities have risen by 47.1 million euros to 276.8 million euros. This is mainly due to the 42.0 million euros increase in amounts owed to affiliates to 218.8 million euros – on account of a rise in the volume of cash pool liabilities – as well as the 4.8 million euros growth in trade payables to 38.9 million euros.\n\n#### Financial position\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nOf the investments in fixed assets excluding financial assets, throughout the various locations of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, 31.2 million euros consisted of property, plant and equipment while 3.6 million euros comprised intangible assets.\n\nIn the past financial year, with a figure of 15.6 million euros much of the company's investments in property, plant and equipment was invested in technical equipment and machinery, followed by 10.4 million euros invested in assets under construction, 4.4 million euros invested in other equipment, furniture and fixtures and 0.7 million euros invested in land.\n\nFinancial assets have increased by 12.9 million euros on the previous year. This is mainly attributable to loans to affiliates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, commitments totalled 9.8 million euros. Of this amount, 9.3 million euros consisted of property, plant and equipment (of which 6.3 million euros for the construction of a production shop), while 0.5 million euros comprised intangible assets.\n\n#### **Financing**\n\nThe credit facilities negotiated in the financial year 2018 were agreed with a total of ten private banks and publicly owned banks. As of the reporting date, the loans taken up have a term of between one and three years (previous year: between one and four years). At the end of the year, the total credit line of the CEWE Group amounted to 91.0 million euros (previous year: 153.0 million euros); this decrease is attributable to the repayment according to schedule of lines of credit no longer required on a long-term basis. After deducting the total volume of credit drawn against (0.0 million euros, previous year: 0.84 million euros) – this does not involve drawing with an impact on liquidity and instead comprises the amount deducted by the credit institutions for guarantees provided – and allowing for the company's existing liquidity (117.37 million euros, previous year: 73.07 million euros), its strong liquidity potential as of the reporting date totalled 207.5 million euros (previous year: 225.23 million euros). The company thus has sufficient long-term revolving credit lines which have been granted for a period of up to three years, continuously renewed one-year lines plus lines of credit made available until further notice whose overall purpose is financing of the company's liquidity requirements, which fluctuate strongly over the course of a given year due to seasonal factors. In principle, no restrictions apply in relation to the use of credit lines. This ensures that CEWE will be able to fully comply with its payment obligations.\n\nAll long-term credit commitments are subject to normal bank agreements. No financial covenants have been agreed. No significant collateral was provided. The interest terms for current account loans are based on €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) as the base interest rate, plus a normal margin in Germany; the interest terms for almost all of the other financing arrangements are based on the one- to three-month EURIBOR as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany. For further details, please see the comments on current interest-bearing financial liabilities (item D64, **[see page 171](#page-172-0)**) and the comments in the combined management report ( **[see page 66](#page-67-0)**).\n\nFor CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the cash flow from operating activities calculated according to GAS 21 increased to 111.2 million euros in the financial year 2023 (previous year: 65.2 million euros). It thus exceeded the cash flow from investing activities of – 22.9 million euros (previous year: – 43.2 million euros). Cash flow from financing activities amounts to – 34.1 million euros (previous year: – 33.9 million euros). Overall, cash and cash equivalents have thus decreased to 101.9 million euros (previous year: 47.7 million euros).\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n3 Combined Management Report\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>83</sup>\n\n# Reports on the company's management\n\n## Management declaration\n\nThis management declaration under §289f and §315d of the German Commercial Code includes the declaration of conformity in accordance with §161 AktG; a reference to the company's website on which the remuneration report for the last financial year and the auditor's report pursuant to §162 AktG and the most recent resolution as regards remuneration pursuant to §113 (3) AktG have been made public; relevant details of corporate governance practices beyond the scope of applicable statutory requirements; and a description of the procedures of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and the makeup and procedures of their committees. It also includes information concerning the stipulations in §76 (4) AktG and §111(5) AktG, information on the minimum proportions of male and female members for the makeup of the Supervisory Board in accordance with §96 (2) AktG, information on whether the company has appointed at least one woman and at least one man to the Board of Management during the reference period, and a description of the company's diversity concept.\n\n#### **Declaration of conformity under §161 of the German Stock Corporation Act**\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board submitted the following declaration pursuant to § 161 AktG in November 2023:\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA attributes great importance to the principles of sound corporate governance.\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA confirm, in accordance with §161 AktG,\n\ntheir compliance, now and in the future, with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code government commission, as notified by the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in the official section of the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger), as amended on April 28, 2022 (\"GCGC\"), with the following exceptions:\n\n#### **Modifications due to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's legal form as a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien – KGaA). In the case of a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares, the general partner has the responsibilities which are handled by the board of management of a public limited company (Aktiengesellschaft – AG). The sole general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, whose Board of Management manages the business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe rights and obligations of the supervisory board of a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares are limited by comparison with those of the supervisory board of a stock corporation. In particular, the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA does not have the power to appoint the Board of Management of the general partner, to prescribe the contractual terms for the Board of Management of the general partner, to issue rules of procedure for the Board of Management or to stipulate transactions subject to approval. Those tasks are performed by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung.\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA are of the opinion that, where the GCGC, as amended, includes recommendations regarding the tasks and competences of the Supervisory Board which are performed by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung on account of the company's legal form, these recommendations are not applicable to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. This applies for the recommendations of the GCGC concerning the makeup of the Board of Management (Recommendations B.1 to B.5) and its remuneration (Recommendations G.1 to G.16). Insofar as the company will deviate from these recommendations in the future on account of its legal form, this is not explicitly disclosed in this declaration of conformity since these recommendations do not apply for the company. This is without prejudice to applicable statutory provisions.\n\nTaking into consideration the above-mentioned details specific to the company's legal form, the Board of Management of the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA confirm in accordance with § 161 AktG that the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, as amended, (\"GCGC\"), have been complied with since the submission of the most recent declaration of conformity in November 2022 (with the exceptions listed below) and will continue to be complied with in future (with the following exceptions):\n\n#### **Elections to the Supervisory Board: attachment of curricula vitae and their contents (deviation from Recommendation C.14 GCGC)**\n\nIn case of impending elections to the Supervisory Board, including the curricula vitae of all of the candidates in the invitation to the general meeting would mean that many\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/23 description: The image shows the words \"cewe group\" in a simple, sans-serif font. The text is black and appears to be on a white background.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\npublication.\n\n## Annual Report 2023\n\ninvitation. Nor do we comply with the recommendation to list the \"key activities\" of candidates in their curricula vitae in this respect. §§ 124 (3) clause 4 and 125 (1) clause 5 AktG include definitive and sufficient stipulations regarding the information to be provided for proposed Supervisory Board candidates. The candidate's current profession and seats on other executive boards must be declared; these details will provide a more detailed impression of the nature and scope of this candidate's other activities and his or her technical qualifications. To require further details\n\nwould go beyond the text of the law and ultimately result in increased legal uncertainty, also because the term \"key activities\" is too imprecise and can be variously interpreted given the wide range of available life choices.\n\n**Rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board: making the rules of procedure accessible on the company's website (deviation from Recommendation D.1 GCGC)** The Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has established rules of procedure for its activities. These rules of procedure are a key instrument in the organisation of the Supervisory Board which regulates procedural issues arising on the Supervisory Board. We are therefore of the view that these rules of procedure are an internal docu-\n\nis already a very long document, which would then be unwieldy. For this reason, the company does not intend to follow the Code's recommendation that curricula vitae be \"attached\" to candidate proposals. The improvement in the quality of the information for shareholders which this recommendation envisages will be more efficiently achieved by providing the curricula vitae of all candidates on the company's website and by additionally pointing out this opportunity to obtain further information in the\n\nadditional pages would be unnecessarily added to what\n\n## **Remuneration system for Supervisory Board/ remuneration report**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA (CEWE-KGaA), with its specific legal form, is legally represented by its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung). This operates through its Board of Management, which thus also manages CEWE-KGaA. CEWE-Stiftung makes decisions regarding the remuneration system for the Board of Management, on the basis of the rules applicable for CEWE-Stiftung. The Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA are responsible for the remuneration reporting – i.e. the voluntary publication of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the publication and presentation of the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG. The underlying documents and the resolution passed by the general meeting in accordance with § 113 (3) AktG on the remuneration received by the members of the Supervisory Board are available at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/6000/corporate-governance.html)**.\n\n#### **Disclosures on management practices**\n\nThe CEWE Group has an established tradition of conducting its business affairs in compliance with national and international legislation as well as generally acknowledged ethical principles.\n\n#### **Commitment to social responsibility as a part of CEWE's corporate culture**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is aware of its social responsibility, which it considers to be an important factor in the company's long-term success. In this respect, the CEWE Group has developed a mission statement which sets out its corporate culture, which is characterised by integrity, trustworthiness and responsibility. The basic values and principles of this mission statement may be viewed online at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compli](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)[ance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)**.\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has also summarised its key principles in a Code of Conduct which is based on ethical values and related business principles that reflect integrity and loyalty. This Code of Conduct applies for all of the Group's employees and requires compliance with the following operating principles:\n\n- Our activities are defined by integrity and lawful behaviour.\n- We aim to safeguard and to expand the CEWE Group's leading position as Europe's foremost provider of photo services.\n- We pursue appropriate business relationships, which are free of any dishonest practices.\n- We avoid any conflicts between the interests of the CEWE Group and private interests.\n- We treat business information and trade secrets confidentially.\n- We will not tolerate any abuse of employees' positions for personal advantage, for the benefit of third parties or to the detriment of the CEWE Group.\n\nFurther information on our Code of Conduct is publicly available on the following website: **[https://company.cewe.](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html) [de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)** \n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA also supports the principles of the compliance initiative of the German Association for Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics.

KGaA and the rules of procedure of the company's various committees, rules are in place at CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for its management and for supervision of its management which comply with the requirements of the GCGC. The company fulfils the GCGC's requirement of protection for investors bearing entrepreneurial risk.\n\nThe Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the Supervisory Board maintain a close and trusting working relationship, while safeguarding the interests of the company. All key business transactions are discussed together with the competent committees. In particular, the details of the relationship between the Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the Supervisory Board and issues for which the Board of Management requires approval are laid down in the rules of procedure of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Management**\n\nThe general partner Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (\"the management\") holds 20,020 no-par value bearer shares in the share capital of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and thus approx. 0.27 %, while the limited shareholders hold the remainder of the shares. Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung manages the company's business through its Board of Management in accordance with applicable legislation, the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its own articles of association and also the\n\nrules of procedure for its Board of Management. Due to its unlimited personal liability, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung has a considerable interest in the orderliness and efficiency of the business activities of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, which it accordingly encourages. The rules of procedure adopted by the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and approved by the Board of Trustees for the Board of Management set out the allocation of duties and cooperation on the Board of Management. The Board of Management passes resolutions at its meetings, which are normally held once a week. Each member of the Board of Management notifies the other members in good time of important events and transactions within his area of business. Specific tasks are assigned to individual members of the Board of Management by means of a schedule of responsibilities.\n\nThe management determines the strategic orientation of the company, plans and specifies the company's budget, is responsible for the allocation of financial resources and supervises the company's business development. It is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the consolidated financial statements as well as the quarterly and semi-annual financial statements. The management also ensures compliance with statutory, official and internal regulations and ensures that all of the companies of the CEWE Group comply with these regulations. Through its integrated governance, risk and compliance approach, the Board of Management has established and implemented a control framework for the CEWE Group which aims to ensure an appropriate and effective internal control and risk management system. The measures implemented within the scope of this approach are likewise aimed to ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness\n\nof the internal control and risk management system. Further information about these measures is provided in the opportunities and risk report, for instance ( **[see](#page-70-0)  [pages 69 ff.](#page-70-0)**). At the same time, independent reviews and audits are carried out within the scope of this three-line model and in accordance with the applicable statutory framework. In particular, these include the audits performed by the internal auditing function and its reporting to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board as well as other external audits.\n\nThe Board of Management is not aware, through its dealing with the internal control and risk management system or from the reporting provided by the internal auditing function, of any significant circumstances indicating that these systems, in their totality, are not appropriate and effective. The management notifies the Supervisory Board of the course of business and the company's position at least once a quarter. The management also notifies the Supervisory Board at least once per year regarding the annual planning and the company's strategy. Moreover, the management notifies the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively regarding any strategy, planning, business development, risk position, risk management and compliance issues which are relevant for the company and thus comprehensively complies with its reporting obligation. In addition, the management reports regularly, promptly and comprehensively – in writing or orally – on any matters which are of material significance for the company. Further details are stipulated in the rules of procedure for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and in the articles of association of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nManagement Report 4 Remu\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n#### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in its management of the company and advises it accordingly. The competences of the Supervisory Board are laid down in its rules of procedure. The key tasks of the Supervisory Board include its review of the company's quarterly reports, its auditing of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its preparation of the resolution to be passed by the general meeting for approval of the annual financial statements. The members of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA are appointed in accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – MitbestG).\n\nOn the basis of the information provided by the company's management, the Supervisory Board considers the course of business and the company's position at least once a quarter. The members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung are invited to attend the meetings of the Supervisory Board, unless the Supervisory Board resolves otherwise in an individual instance. For part of each Supervisory Board meeting, the Supervisory Board deliberates on its own without the members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung being present. Moreover, at each of its meetings the Supervisory Board systematically discusses the following issues:\n\n- Corporate governance\n- Compliance\n- The company's risk situation\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Board of Trustees are notified of key decisions of the Board of Management early on. The management and the Supervisory Board also regularly discuss issues of strategy and planning as well as current business developments outside of these meetings. The Supervisory Board maintains regular contact with the management, so as to obtain early notification of the company's current business development as well as significant business transactions. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses whether conflicts of interest may apply for members of the Board of Management or the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in relation to the work which they perform for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\nIn the period under review, an Audit Committee performed the tasks required of it by law and assigned to it under the rules of procedure approved by the overall Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's discussions and resolutions concerning the approval of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements and the proposal to be made to the general meeting on the appointment of the auditor. It is also concerned with monitoring the financial reporting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, compliance and the internal audit system as well as the external audit, in particular the selection and independence of the auditor, the quality of its audit and the additional services provided by the auditor.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the members of the Audit Committee were Ms Daniela Mattheus (Chairwoman), Mr Markus Schwarz (Deputy Chairman), Mr Kersten Duwe and Mr Nurol Altan. Pursuant to § 107 (4) in conjunction with § 100 (5) AktG, at least one member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of financial reporting and at least one further member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of auditing. In the field of auditing, the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Ms Daniela Mattheus, has particular knowledge and experience of auditing. Following a long career with a series of well-known audit firms, Ms Daniela Mattheus is now a self-employed consultant and serves on various supervisory boards. Ms Daniela Mattheus therefore continuously deals with auditing issues in her capacity as a member of the supervisory boards of Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bahn AG, Berlin, and Jenoptik AG, Jena.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 Mr Kersten Duwe was a further expert pursuant to § 100 (5) AktG on the Audit Committee. As a lawyer and tax adviser, he has the relevant expertise and serves on the Audit Committee as a financial expert in the area of financial reporting.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nto the shareholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board has also established a Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee prepares the resolutions to be passed by the Supervisory Board on nominations which are to be submitted to the general meeting regarding the appointment of Supervisory Board members provided by the limited shareholders. It follows the criteria specified by the Supervisory Board on its makeup as well as the competence profile adopted by the Supervisory Board. As of December 31, 2023, Mr Kersten Duwe, Dr Vemmer and Mr Paolo Dell'Antonio are the mem-\n\nIn order to provide more efficient support in relation to the ongoing development of the Group-wide IT structure, the Supervisory Board appointed an advisory committee. The Board of Management keeps this committee regularly informed of key developments. Ms Petra Adolph, Dr Birgit Vemmer (Chairwoman), Mr Marc Bohlken and Mr Paolo Dell' Antonio were elected to this committee. Its first\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees regularly undergo an efficiency review of their own and incorporate the findings in their future activities. At its meeting of March 17, 2021, the Supervisory Board carried out a self-evaluation of the effectiveness of its functioning as a supervisory board within the meaning of Recommendation D.12 of the GCGC. Various members suggested enhancing the work of the Supervisory Board through additional training opportunities and presentations by external experts.\n\nbers of the Nomination Committee.\n\nmeeting was held at the start of 2024.\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\nFor further information, please refer to the report of the Supervisory Board **[pages 42 ff.](#page-43-0)** of this annual report and online at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html) [compliance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)**).\n\n#### **Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung**\n\nSome of the tasks which are performed by a public limited company's supervisory board are handled by Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung at CEWE, specifically by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung. Accordingly, the details of the Board of Trustees are outlined below.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has six members. The Board of Trustees advises and supervises the Board of Management. It keeps up-to-date regarding the affairs of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and may inspect and audit the commercial books and other documents of the company and also its assets for this purpose. According to § 7 (2) of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the management requires the consent of the Supervisory Board for certain transactions beyond the scope of normal business. The articles of association of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung also stipulate the consent of the Board of Trustees for certain extraordinary measures enacted by the management. The Board of Trustees is convened as required, but meets at least four times a year.\n\n#### **The general meeting of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA**\n\nIn particular, the annual general meeting passes resolutions regarding the approval of the annual financial statements, appropriation of unappropriated profits, ratification of the actions of the general partner and the members of the Supervisory Board, and the appointment of the auditor. The general meeting is also entitled to resolve amendments to the articles of association. The limited shareholders of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA exercise their rights at the general meeting.\n\n#### **Target figures pursuant to §76 (4) and §111 (5) AktG and minimum proportions for the makeup of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board**\n\nSince the company does not have any Board of Management pursuant to § 278 AktG, the provision laid down in § 111 (5) AktG concerning the makeup of the Board of Management does not apply for the company. Moreover, the obligation to determine a target size for the Board of Management is not applicable insofar as the requirement under § 76 (3a) AktG concerning the membership of this Board of Management is applicable (§ 111 (5) clause 9 AktG). In accordance with the statutory requirements, no target quota has been specified for the Board of Management.\n\nThe German Stock Corporation Act, as amended by the Second German Act on Management Positions (Zweites Führungspositionen-Gesetz – FüPoG II), prescribes that stock-market-listed companies which consist of equal numbers of representatives and which have a board of\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>87</sup>\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>88</sup>\n\nmanagement comprising more than three members must appoint at least one woman and at least one man to their board of management. Irrespective of the legal question of whether §76 (3a) AktG is at all applicable to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, either directly or analogously, the company complied with this requirement in the reporting period, since Ms Yvonne Rostock was appointed Chairwoman (CEO) with effect as of March 1, 2023 and Ms Christina Sontheim-Leven was appointed to the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung with effect as of January 1, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the statutory obligation stipulated in § 76 (4) AktG and its own long-term human resources goal of achieving a gender balance, the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung has specified the following new targets which it aims to achieve by June 30, 2027:\n\n- first management level of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA below the Board of Management: 33.3 % of management positions held by women\n- second management level of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA below the Board of Management: 40 % of management positions held by women\n\nThe first management level comprises all of the executives of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA with a direct reporting line to the Board of Management. The second management level comprises all of the executives of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA reporting to executives with a direct reporting line to the Board of Management.\n\nAs an international company with (management) structures which reflect this orientation, while aiming to achieve an equal number of male and female employees in management positions in the long term, the CEWE Group has set itself a voluntary target of increasing the proportion of women in management positions in all of its companies (national subsidiaries) and brands. A glance at the CEWE Group as a whole shows that things are already moving in the right direction.\n\nNew elections to the Supervisory Board were held in the reporting period. The Supervisory Board has twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the company's shareholders and half by its employees. The Supervisory Board had four female members appointed by the shareholders following the new elections. Of the Supervisory Board members appointed by the shareholders, a women's quota of two thirds (four out of six seats held by the shareholders' representatives) was thus achieved. The Supervisory Board had two female members appointed by the employees following the new elections. Of the Supervisory Board members appointed by the employees, a women's quota of one third (two out of six seats held by the employees' representatives) was thus achieved. The shareholders and the employees therefore both fulfilled the statutory requirement of a minimum women's quota of 30 % on the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Diversity concept in regard to the makeup of the Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board**\n\nRecommendations A.2, B.1 and C.1 clause 2 of the GCGC deal with the issue of diversity in terms of appointments to the Board of Management and management positions within the company as well as the makeup of the Supervisory Board. With the goal of sound corporate governance, the management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA have considered this issue in detail within the scope of their responsibilities.\n\n#### **Makeup of the Board of Management**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung consisted of five male members and (from March 1, 2023) two female members in the reporting period. All of the members of the Board of Management have international experience.\n\nMs Yvonne Rostock was appointed the Chairwoman (CEO) of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and thus of the CEWE Group with effect as of March 1, 2023. As well as holding the post of CEO, Ms Yvonne Rostock also has overall responsibility for the CEWE Group's distribution activities.\n\nThe company seeks to ensure the adequate representation of women and in general to reflect diversity in its appointments of members of the Board of Management.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n**Financial Statements** 6 Fur\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>89</sup>\n\n#### **Makeup of the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA in § 2.1 of the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. In principle, membership of the Supervisory Board is to end on December 31 in the year in which the respective Supervisory Board member reaches the age of 71. In deviation from this principle, the other members of the Supervisory Board may resolve with a two-thirds majority to extend this person's membership, but not beyond the end of the year in which the member in question reaches the age of 75.\n\n#### **Composition targets and competence profile of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn September 2023, the Supervisory Board defined its competence profile and published this on the company's website at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate-group.html)[group.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate-group.html)**. The current members of the Supervisory Board match this competence profile.\n\n#### **Independence of the Supervisory Board members**\n\nWith its makeup during the reporting period, the Supervisory Board almost entirely complied with the requirements set out in Recommendations C.1 to C.12 of the GCGC. The Supervisory Board has reviewed the independence of its members.\n\nMr Frank Zweigle was appointed a member of the Supervisory Board pursuant to the order of Oldenburg Local Court with effect from January 1, 2023 for a period of office expiring at the end of the 2023 general meeting. At the same time, Mr Zweigle was appointed to the position of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, starting on January 1, 2023 and ending at the 2023 general meeting.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that, until December 31, 2021, Mr Frank Zweigle was a member of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, he was independent of the company and of the Board of Management of the general partner, since he did not have any personal or business relationship with the company or the Board of Management such as would constitute a significant and not merely temporary conflict of interest. Membership of the Board of Management of the general partner in the two years prior to his appointment is only one of four indicators which, according to the GCGC, were to be taken into consideration when assessing the independence of the members of the Supervisory Board. It was not decisive on its own. In the view of the Supervisory Board, all of the relevant circumstances must be jointly considered in order to assess the independence of a Supervisory Board member. The other three indicators expressly mentioned in the GCGC which must be assessed when evaluating the independence of a Supervisory Board member were not fulfilled in the case of Mr Frank Zweigle. These indicators are whether the Supervisory Board member or a close relative\n\n- currently maintains, or has maintained in the year leading up to his or her appointment, either directly or as a shareholder or via a position of responsibility with a company outside of the corporate group, a significant business relationship with the company or a dependent enterprise,\n- is a close relative of a member of the Board of Management.\n- has belonged to the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years.\n\nIn the view of the Supervisory Board, it was in the interests of the company that it be able to continue to make use of Mr Frank Zweigle's long-standing experience as a member of the Board of Management of the general partner. The Supervisory Board is satisfied that a period of two years from Mr Frank Zweigle's resignation from the Board of Management of the general partner was not necessary in order to ensure his independence.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance<br>2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report<br>→ Reports on the company's management              | 4 Remuneration                                               | 5 Financial Statements                                                                    | 6 Further Information                                                                                    |                                         |                                                                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                         |                                                      |                                                                                                       | 90                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Skills and expertise matrix                 |                                                                                    |                                                              |                                                                                           |                                                                                                          |                                         |                                                                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                         |                                                      |                                                                                                       |                             |\n|                                             | 1.

The company has thus more than fulfilled the statutory requirement of 30 % female representation on its Supervisory Board. While fulfilling\n\napplicable statutory requirements, in any future nominations the Supervisory Board will also appropriately consider whether candidates have the necessary skills, competences and technical experience which are required for service on the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Appointments to management positions**\n\nIn compliance with Recommendation A.2 of the GCGC, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has already implemented a large number of measures which are intended to promote diversity – in particular, a greater share of women – in management positions.\n\nFor instance, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has enacted the following specific measures to encourage a better balance between career and family needs:\n\n- Contract with \"AWO Eltern- und Seniorenservice\" in Oldenburg to provide free consultations for employees needing to arrange placements for their children or for their parents.\n- Since August 2022, two large day nurseries at CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's site in Oldenburg. The second nursery means that additional places can be offered in view of the high level of demand.\n- Course enabling mothers and fathers to strengthen their minds (\"Rediscover your power\").\n- Programme to help employees keep in touch during parental leave.\n- Management while working part-time.\n- Mobile working and more flexible work hours which provide support and makes things easier for employees in various life situations.\n- Own care programme for children during the Easter, summer and autumn holidays.\n\nRecruitment measures have also been further improved. For example:\n\n- Revised wording in job advertisements\n- Planned participation at career fairs which are specifically aimed at a female audience (HERCareer)\n- Stronger focus on advertising jobs which include part-time roles\n\nMoreover, at its meeting held on February 13, 2023 the Board of Management had expressly confirmed the resolution passed by the Board of Management of CEWE COLOR Holding AG on January 31, 2011:\n\nThe company seeks to ensure the adequate representation of women and in general to reflect diversity in its appointments to management positions. As well as the existing measures enacted in support of this criterion, the following measures are to be implemented in addition:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nand the structuring of internal development programmes\n\nIn regard to proposed appointments to management positions, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA also takes into consideration factors including candidates' age, gender, cultural origin and educational and professional backgrounds and seeks to achieve the greatest possible level of diversity.\n\nDrafting and implementation of a programme which considers the issues of \"Women in management positions\", \"Promotion of women as junior executives\" and \"International approach at the management level\". This resolution remains valid for appointments to management positions\n\n## Final declaration by the Board of Management\n\nof the general partner on the report on relationships with affiliates\n\nThe status of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung as the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA means that, in principle, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is dependent on Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung within the meaning of §17 AktG. Since no control agreement has been concluded with Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in accordance with § 291 AktG, as the management body of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA (CEWE-KGaA), with its specific legal form, is legally represented by its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung). This operates through its Board of Management, which thus also manages CEWE-KGaA. CEWE-Stiftung makes decisions regarding the remuneration system for the Board of Management, on the basis of the rules applicable for CEWE-Stiftung. The Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA are responsible for the remuneration reporting – i.e. the voluntary publication of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung – and the publication and presentation of the remuneration report pursuant to §§ 162 and 120 a (4) AktG.\n\n## Basic features of the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\n\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management is clearly designed and easy to understand. The Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung is responsible for drafting the contracts of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Trustees assumes that all of the members of the Board of Management will make equal contributions to the success of the CEWE Group. However, the remuneration paid to the Chairman of the Board of Management differs to an appropriate degree, on account of his greater level of responsibility. The\n\nremuneration system is moreover in keeping with international practice and the necessary level of flexibility for what is, to a considerable extent, a seasonal business model. This remuneration continues to comprise fixed and performance-related variable components. As well as the tasks handled by the members of the Board of Management, the criteria for determination of overall remuneration are the economic success of the CEWE Group and its peer group. The company's remuneration structure is intended to promote its sustainable and positive longterm development.\n\n#### **Determination, implementation and review of the remuneration system**\n\nThe remuneration paid over to the members of the Board of Management is determined by the Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung. It thereby complies with the requirements of the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung – VorstAG). Insofar as a remuneration consultant is involved in the process of drafting the remuneration system, the Board of Trustees will ensure that this consultant is independent of the Board of Management and the company. No external remuneration expert has been consulted for the current remuneration system.\n\nThe Board of Trustees ensures that the overall remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is, on the one hand, proportionate to their tasks and performance\n\nwhile, on the other, appropriately reflecting the CEWE Group's economic and financial position. In addition, the Board of Management's remuneration has been designed with the company's long-term and sustainable development in mind.\n\nThe Board of Trustees continuously reviewed the appropriateness of this remuneration in 2023. Within the scope of its review, in a horizontal comparison remuneration levels of companies of a similar size and level of complexity are compared. In a vertical comparison, the remuneration paid to the management levels below the Board of Management and the average remuneration paid to the workforce of the CEWE Group are considered. Finally, the development of these variables over time is also taken into consideration.\n\nThe remuneration system safeguards the company's longterm development by ensuring a balance between performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration components, thus preventing the members of the Board of Management from entering into disproportionately high risks in order to achieve bonuses.\n\n#### **Overall context for the remuneration system**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management receive fixed remuneration and variable remuneration for their service. Their variable remuneration consists of a bonus plus longterm incentive components.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe contracts concluded with the members of the Board of Management all contain the same terms regarding remuneration; this relates to the contractual provisions as well as the structure of remuneration, with the exception of the maximum remuneration in the case of bonus II. The Chairwoman of the Board of Management enjoys superior remuneration-related conditions to those of the other Board of Management members.\n\n#### **Fixed gross remuneration**\n\nThe fixed gross remuneration consists of a fixed monthly amount (fixed remuneration) as well as non-cash remuneration (fringe benefits). The fixed remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Management is a good 50 % higher than that of all of the other ordinary members of the Board of Management. Fixed remuneration is paid out regardless of performance in equal monthly instalments. The fixed remuneration of the members of the Board of Management has been adjusted so that – with the exception of the Chairman of the Board of Management – each member of the Board of Management receives the same fixed remuneration; this consistency is maintained irrespective of the durations of the individual contracts.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management also receive non-cash remuneration, which is reported on the basis of the taxable amounts. This mainly consists of the use of a company car and occupational insurance premiums; the members of the Board of Management are entitled to receive the non-cash remuneration in the same way and pay tax on it. They are also entitled to the reimbursement of entertainment expenses and travel costs at the maximum rates permitted for tax purposes, insofar as such expenses and costs are exclusively incurred in the interests of CEWE-Stiftung.\n\nCEWE-Stiftung bears the Board of Management member's relocation costs. On a one-time basis, it will refund standard estate agent's fees for an appropriate, rented residence in Oldenburg or the local area. In the event of the member of the Board of Management purchasing a home, CEWE-KGaA will pay the equivalent of two monthly rent instalments on the basis of this property's rented value.\n\nThe company maintains a Group financial loss liability insurance policy (D&O insurance) for the members of the Board of Management. Cover for the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA complies with the requirements of the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration. The insured member of the Board of Management thus bears 10 % of a potential loss, up to one-and-ahalf times their fixed annual remuneration.\n\nInsurance cover also applies through third-party liability insurance for managers as well as insurance covering legal expenses under criminal law for all of the company's employees. The members of the Board of Management are also jointly insured against any violations which they commit, or are alleged to have committed, in the performance of their duties. The company has moreover taken out an accident insurance policy for all of its executives. This includes all of the members of the Board of Management.\n\n#### **Pension scheme**\n\nPension obligations apply in relation to the members of the Board of Management in the form of a direct commitment. The value of their pension entitlements is calculated on the basis of the fixed remuneration most recently paid for their service on the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung. The pension entitlement will have been vested\n\nfollowing a period of 15 years (in one case, 20 years) of service on the Board of Management and will not exceed between 50 % and two-thirds of the fixed remuneration last received by the member of the Board of Management in question. The structure of the pension scheme applies equally for all of the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung. The pension benefit will be paid in twelve equal monthly instalments and shall be due on the last day of each month. As a rule, the commitments entered into do not include provision for dependants; however, provision has been made for dependants in some individual cases, with no effect on expenses. In individual cases, if the member of the Board of Management served as a managing director in the CEWE Group prior to his appointment to the Board of Management, as part of the company's pension scheme the company also maintains life insurance policies with a capital payment in the event of premature death as provision for dependants or, in case of survival, as a pension. Instead of the normal type of pension scheme described above, the new Chairwoman of the Board of Management who took up her position in the spring of 2023 will be transferred ownership of 5,000 shares of CEWE-KGaA upon completion of each year of service, in February of the following year of service.\n\n#### **Variable remuneration**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management receive variable, performance-related remuneration. The variable remuneration components are divided up into three different components and consist of one-year variable remuneration – i.e. a bonus share, payable annually (bonus I) – multi-year variable remuneration – in the form of a multi-year bonus share (bonus II) – and a long-term, share-based remuneration component (stock option plan). These remuneration components consist of the following core components:\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>99</sup>\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nBonus I and bonus II are calculated separately from one another.\n\nBonus I is based on earnings before taxes (EBT) as well as depreciation on property, plant and equipment and amortisation on intangible assets of the CEWE Group. Overall, it is limited to a maximum of 100 % of the fixed remuneration in a given year. This only includes bonus shares which are relevant for depreciation purposes and which have been earned through earnings before tax (earned depreciation). Bonus I will be calculated and paid out in the following year, within ten days of the consolidated financial statements having acquired binding force.\n\nBonus II with its multi-year component relates to earnings before taxes (EBT); it is calculated on the basis of the total EBT over the term of the employment contract of the Board of Management member in question. The multi-year bonus II will not attract any interest. In three cases, it is limited to a maximum of 100 % of the fixed remuneration. The balance resulting from bonus II is retained for the multi-year term of the contract of the respective member of the Board of Management and will be paid out six months after the end of this person's employment contract.\n\nFor both bonus portions, bonus I and bonus II, the Chairman of the Board of Management's entitlement is roughly 25 % to 50 % higher than that of a further ordinary member of the Board of Management.\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\nIn the event of a member of the Board of Management retiring over the course of a year, bonus I and bonus II will be calculated pro rata temporis and paid out in the following year within ten days of the consolidated financial statements acquiring binding force.\n\nStock option plans were established in 2019 and in the period from 2021 to 2023 in which the members of the Board of Management who held office at that time were permitted to participate in the same way and to the same extent. These plans are intended to reward the members of the Board of Management for the long-term improvement in the company's value via its share price. All of these stock option plans (SOP 2019, SOP 2021, SOP 2022 and SOP 2023) had (and have) essentially the same terms. Since the SOP 2019, they have been designed in such a way that, if the options are successfully exercised, the economic benefit will accrue in the form of CEWE-KGaA shares rather than in cash form. Participation in these\n\nplans and the volume of options purchased are subject to the discretion of the members of the Board of Management, up to a maximum total. They do not have any contractual entitlement for the implementation of these plans or for their participation in them. No holding period has been stipulated for participating members of the Board of Management in regard to shares arising from the stock option plans. The underlying prices, the performance targets and the fair value of the options within the scope of the currently applicable option programmes are indicated below. Please **[see pages 162 ff.](#page-163-0)** for further details of these programmes.\n\nNo non-financial performance targets have been agreed. The contracts of the members of the Board of Management do not include any clawback provisions.\n\nExtraordinary developments (such as the disposal of shares in the company and the realisation of hidden reserves) are not included in the calculation of bonus I and bonus II. In the event of a deterioration in the position of CEWE-KGaA, CEWE-Stiftung may reduce these amounts appropriately, if their continued grant would otherwise be unreasonable.\n\n#### **Stock option plans: fair values, underlying prices and performance targets**\n\n|          |                     | Number of<br>participants | Number of<br>rights issued | Fair value<br>euros/opt. | Fair value<br>in euros | Underlying<br>price<br>euros/opt. | Performance<br>premium<br>as % | Performance<br>target<br>euros/opt. |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| SOP 2023 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 18.19                    | 152,796.00             | 87.00                             | 120                            | 104.40                              |\n| SOP 2022 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 23.88                    | 200,592.00             | 76.00                             | 120                            | 91.20                               |\n| SOP 2021 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 22.63                    | 190,092.00             | 121.00                            | 120                            | 145.20                              |\n| SOP 2019 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 12.82                    | 107,688.00             | 81.00                             | 125                            | 101.25                              |\n| Total    | Board of Management |                           | 33,600                     |                          | 651,168.00             |                                   |                                |                                     |\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the extremely high level of motivation in the overall Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung does not see any need for specific provisions or for overall target remuneration for individual members of the Board of Management. No distinctions have been made for different areas of business.\n\nOverall, the remuneration has been designed such that the fixed remuneration components account for around 50 % to 70 % of overall remuneration and the variable remuneration components for around 30 % to 50 % of overall remuneration.\n\n#### **Other remuneration-related arrangements**\n\nThe contracts with members of the Board of Management are exclusively term contracts which, according to the articles of association of CEWE-Stiftung, may be concluded for a period of up to five years. There is no provision for regular termination of a contract. The contracts of the members of the Board of Management currently vary in terms of their duration and end dates. In no case is the duration longer than a period of three years.\n\nThe following arrangements apply in the event of the premature termination of the contracts of the members of the Board of Management: in case of dismissal for good cause, their contracts will have been terminated as of the date of dismissal. In case of a dismissal which is not made for good cause or which is made on grounds lying outside of the responsibility of the member of the Board of Management, their fixed remuneration will be paid up to the end of the term of their contract. In addition, in this case this member of the Board of Management will receive a\n\nsettlement in the amount of half of their fixed remuneration in case of a period of at least twelve months before he begins to draw a pension, and otherwise a pro rata compensation amount. Pro rata payment rules apply for the payment of any positive bonus II balance. The company has not concluded any compensation agreements with the members of the Board of Management to cover the event of a takeover offer (§ 315a (1) no. 9 HGB).\n\nIn the event of a member of the Board of Management giving notice to quit due to a change of control, this member's fixed remuneration and bonuses I and II will be paid pro rata temporis. No settlement will be paid for the loss of future fixed remuneration or bonuses.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung reserves the right to agree a post-contractual non-compete clause.\n\nNo remuneration is granted by other companies in the CEWE Group. Nor has the company concluded any agreements on discretionary or guaranteed bonus payments.\n\n#### The remuneration system for members of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\nThe remuneration of the Supervisory Board members merely consists of fixed remuneration; the company's long-term development is thus promoted, since the Supervisory Board's decisions are not influenced by the achievement of bonus targets. The remuneration system was drafted for the members of the Supervisory Board,\n\nseparately adopted by the Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board and then adopted by the general meeting on June 15, 2022. § 14 of the articles of association of CEWE-KGaA was revised in this respect. This new system applies from the financial year 2022 onwards.\n\nThe following detailed provisions apply: the basic remuneration of a member of the Supervisory Board is 43,000 euros (previous year: 43,000 euros). A higher level of remuneration is envisaged for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. This amounts to twice the level of basic remuneration for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and one-and-a-half times this amount for the Deputy Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Audit Committee. In addition, each Supervisory Board member receives an attendance fee of 2,000 euros (previous year: 2,000 euros) for their personal attendance of a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees, regardless of whether this is in person, in virtual form or over the telephone. Half of the fixed gross remuneration will fall due for payment as of June 30 of the current financial year and the other half, plus the attendance fees, within one month of the end of the financial year to which this remuneration relates.\n\nCEWE-KGaA reimburses the members of the Supervisory Board any value added tax payable on their remuneration. Members of the Supervisory Board are covered by the company's D&O insurance policy. A deductible of 10 % of the possible damage applies for them, up to a total amount of one-and-a-half times their fixed Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\ners 3 Combined Management Re\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\n6 Further Inform\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-103-0\"></span>The Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung) and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA hereby provide the following remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG within the scope of their remuneration reporting. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are to present it to the general meeting of CEWE-KGaA in order for a resolution to be passed on its approval (§ 120a (4) AktG). This report covers the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the Supervisory Board members of CEWE-KGaA as well as former members of the Board of Management of the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG, which underwent a change of form in 2013 to become CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, and CEWE-Stiftung. At the general meeting held on June 7, 2023, the remuneration report for the financial year 2022 was approved by means of a resolution.\n\n#### **Individual remuneration of the members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung for 2023**\n\nThe following reporting of remuneration for the year under review and financial year 2023 is in accordance with § 162 AktG. The tables distinguish between the remuneration actually received (remuneration granted within the meaning of § 162 (1), clause 1 AktG) and remuneration which is already due but which has not yet been paid out (remuneration owed within the meaning of § 162 (1) clause 1 AktG); in addition, a distinction is made – and reported on a voluntary basis – between remuneration which is owed and\n\npromised but is not yet due and, finally, other benefits paid to a member of the Board of Management in the event of regular termination of their service (benefits within the meaning of § 162 (2), item 3 AktG).\n\n→ Remuneration report\n\nMs Yvonne Rostock joined the Board of Management as its Chairwoman on March 1, 2023; her remuneration is thus reported for the first time in this year under review. The breakdown of this remuneration is as follows for the individual members of the Board of Management:\n\nThe fixed remuneration of the serving members of the Board of Management was structured in individual cases so that all of the Board of Management members received the same amount of fixed remuneration, irrespective of the terms of their individual employment contracts. This remuneration remained unchanged in the period up to December 31, 2023. In deviation from the remuneration system, on joining the company in August 2023 Ms Rostock was paid a one-off joining bonus of 200,000 euros which is included in her fringe benefits.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration        | 5 Financial Statements | 6

Moreover, nor has the company entered into any contingent liabilities for the benefit of the members of the Board of Management. Insofar as contractual provisions on maximum remuneration are applicable, these were reviewed; they were not violated or exceeded in any case. No early termination of employment contracts was agreed in the year under review. Mr Zweigle, who resigned from the Board of Management on December 31, 2021, has retained the options which he acquired from the SOP 2017, SOP 2019 and SOP 2021 programmes. In the case of Dr Friege, who resigned on December 31, 2022, notwithstanding his resignation the options offered and purchased during his period of service will continue to apply for their respective term and Dr Friege is entitled to exercise them. In addition, no commitments were made to a former member of the Board of Management in connection with the termination of this person's service in the previous financial year which were granted in the previous financial year (§ 162 (2) no. 2 AktG). Finally, nor were any temporary deviations from the existing remuneration system agreed or resolved in the year under review.\n\n#### **Remuneration of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA**\n\nThe Supervisory Board consists of twelve members. Since 2022, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members has consisted of fixed remuneration only. The provision applicable since the financial year 2022 is a new provision and has replaced the old stipulations in § 14 of the articles of association of CEWE-KGaA.\n\nThe following detailed provisions apply: the basic remuneration of a member of the Supervisory Board is 43,000 euros (previous year: 43,000 euros). A higher level of remuneration is envisaged for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. This amounts to twice the level of basic remuneration for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and one-and-a-half times this amount for the Deputy Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Audit Committee. In addition, each Supervisory Board member receives an attendance fee of 2,000 euros (previous year: 2,000 euros) for their personal attendance of a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees, regardless of whether this is in person, in virtual form or over the telephone.\n\nHalf of the fixed gross remuneration will fall due for payment as of June 30 of the current financial year and the other half, plus the attendance fees, within one month of the end of the financial year to which this remuneration relates.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The following calculation was made in 2023 for remuneration components payable to the Supervisory Board members:\n\n#### **Supervisory Board remuneration, shareholdings, options** in thousands of euros\n\n| 20221                                         |                       |                 |                       |                         | 20232             |                       |                 |                       |                         |                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                               | Fixed<br>remuneration | Attendance fees | Total<br>remuneration | Shareholdings<br>number | Options<br>number | Fixed<br>remuneration | Attendance fees | Total<br>remuneration | Shareholdings<br>number | Options<br>number |\n| Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

The above amounts are exclusive of value added tax. None of the members of the Supervisory Board has received or been granted third-party payments in relation to their service. One member of the Supervisory Board provided consulting services to a limited extent in the year under review and the previous year (2023: 0 thousand euros, 2022: 14 thousand euros).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are also covered by the company's D&O insurance policy. A deductible of 10 % of the possible damage has been agreed for them, up to a total amount of one-and-a-half times their fixed Supervisory Board remuneration. No loans or advance payments have been granted to members of the Supervisory Board. Nor has the company entered into any contingent liabilities for their benefit.\n\n#### **Pension commitments and pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung or the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG**\n\nFor former members of the Board of Management of the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG and CEWE-Stiftung, as of December 31, 2023 the company had made pension accruals in the amount of 16,970 thousand euros (previous year: 14,393 thousand euros). Pension payments for the financial year 2023 amounted to 1,190 thousand euros (previous year: 1,091 thousand euros). With effect as of April 1, 2007, the pension commitments for the former members of the Board of Management who had already retired as of this date were transferred to CEWE COLOR Versorgungskasse e.V., Wiesbaden. They are included in the consolidated financial statements. The company's pension commitments for the other retired members of the Board of Management were maintained in the form of a direct commitment. Loans, advance payments or contingent liabilities have not been granted for former members of the executive bodies (i.e. the Board of Management or Supervisory Board, where applicable) of CEWE-Stiftung, the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG or the current CEWE-KGaA.\n\nThe company has not paid any remuneration to retired members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n≡ ⇱ 🔍 ⟨**114**⟩\n\n#### **Comparative presentation of the remuneration and earnings trend for the current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung und Co. KGaA, the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG and Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung**\n\nThe following comparative presentation shows the annual change in the remuneration granted and owed for the current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the earnings trend for CEWE-KGaA and the CEWE Group and the remuneration received by employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The remuneration of employees is calculated on the basis of the average wages and salaries of employees of CEWE-KGaA in the financial year in question. The internal peer group has been deliberately limited to CEWE-KGaA, on the one hand due to the external comparison of the remuneration\n\npaid to CEWE's Board of Management with that of SDAX companies and, on the other, because CEWE-KGaA accounts for most of the Group's employees.\n\n#### **Comparative presentation of the remuneration and earnings trend** in thousands of euros\n\n|

It most recently did so for the financial year 2021. The company thus fulfils the statutory requirements. However, for the\n\nfinancial year 2023 it remains the case that men and women in executive roles are remunerated according to their position. No distinction is made between men and women in this respect. In addition, CEWE strongly emphasises equal opportunities for the development of men and women.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/0 description: The photograph captures a dramatic scene of a glacier calving, with seals resting on ice floes in the foreground. The glacier, a massive wall of blue ice, dominates the upper portion of the image. A large section of the glacier is in the process of breaking off, sending a spray of ice and water into the air. The water is a mix of blues and grays, reflecting the sky and the ice. In the foreground, several seals are lounging on small ice floes, seemingly unconcerned by the calving event. The seals are dark in color, contrasting with the white ice. The overall composition of the image is striking, with the power of nature on full display. Text on the left side of the image reads \"Christian Bovians, Germany - winner of the Nature category\".\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>5 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nImage /page/118/Figure/7 description: This image contains a list of financial statements and reports, including the consolidated profit and loss account (page 118), consolidated statement of comprehensive income (page 119), consolidated balance sheet (page 120), consolidated statement of changes in equity (page 122), consolidated cash flow statement (page 123), segment reporting by business unit (page 124), notes (page 125), responsibility statement (page 187), independent auditor's report (page 188), and the CEWE Group structure and executive bodies (page 195).\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration 5\n\n→ Consolidated profit and loss account\n\n6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-119-0\"></span>Consolidated profit and loss account\n\nfor the financial year 2023 of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

However, they have not yet come into force, and their effects will only become apparent in a subsequent reporting year.\n\nThe new standards and amendments of existing standards are not expected to have any significant impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations. The following standards and interpretations and amendments of existing standards which have also been issued by the IASB as of the balance sheet date are not yet mandatorily applicable in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. They will become applicable following their adoption within the scope of the EU's endorsement of the IFRS.\n\n#### **Amendment/standard**\n\nStandards and interpretations which are not yet mandatorily applicable in the EU are listed here. However, they have been resolved with mandatory effect and are currently being transposed into national law within the scope of an EU endorsement process.\n\nThe future effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations resulting from implementation of the standards issued as of the reporting date but not yet mandatorily applicable are still being reviewed. Several standards may necessitate additional notes. The new standards will be adopted in the EU upon completion of the endorsement procedure.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>**Determination of fair values**\n\n#### As far as possible, CEWE uses data observable on the market in order to determine the fair value of an asset or a liability. On the basis of the input factors used within the scope of the valuation techniques, the fair values have been assigned to the different levels of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: valuation parameters which do not involve the quoted prices included in Level 1 but which are observable for the asset or the liability either directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3: valuation parameters for assets or liabilities which are not based on observable market data.\n\nWith the exception of the derivatives carried in the balance sheet at fair value, in these annual financial statements all assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost. For assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, the book values of the financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet represent a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\nDerivatives reported in the balance sheet are carried at fair value. The market values determined by credit institutions are arrived at by discounting the expected future cash flows throughout the remaining term of the contracts on the basis of individual, nonobservable input parameters (Level 3 according to IFRS 7). The effects are of minor significance.\n\nThe profit and loss account has been prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures refer to thousands of euros.\n\n## 3 Scope of consolidation\n\n→ Notes:\n\nA. General disclosures\n\nApart from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 include domestic and foreign companies over which CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has a direct or indirect controlling interest. The Group has control over a company if it is exposed to risk in relation to fluctuating yields, or is entitled to receive these yields, from its holdings in the company in question, and if the Group also has the ability to use its power of control over the investee so as to affect the value of the yield granted by this investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements as of the point in time at which the relationship of control begins, and remain so until the relationship of control ends.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, apart from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, as the parent company, the scope of consolidation includes 12 German and 19 foreign companies (cf. E69, **[page 179](#page-180-0)**). The pension commitments transferred to the pension fund CEWE COLOR Versorgungskasse e.V., Wiesbaden, according to IAS 19 are also included in the scope of consolidation. No contractual trust arrangement (CTA) is applicable, since the pension commitments remain attributable to CEWE-KGaA from a legal point of view. Insofar as this pension fund is unable to meet its obligations on the basis of its own resources, resources are provided by CEWE-KGaA.\n\nAs in the previous year, [Bilderplanet.de](https://Bilderplanet.de) GmbH, Cologne, which is not operationally active, has not been included in the scope of consolidation due to its economic insignificance. The same applies for Diginet Danmark ApS, Åbyhøj, Denmark, which was newly established in October 2022 and is not yet operationally active.\n\nThe subsidiary futalis GmbH was sold on December 21, 2023. Control over this company was transferred to the purchaser on the same date. The CEWE Group has made an important contribution to the development of futalis' business over the past few years. This company will now make its next strategic moves under its own steam. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023 futalis was for the first time classified as held for sale. The previous-year figures in the consolidated profit and loss account have been restated accordingly, so as to present this discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. futalis GmbH is presented in the \"Other Activities\" business unit, **[page 22](#page-23-0)**.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remuneration\n\nents 6 Further Inform\n\n→ Notes: A.

For all of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements, the reporting date for the separate financial statements is the same as the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements, i.e. December 31, 2023.\n\nAcquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition costs correspond to the fair value of the assets provided, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities arising or assumed as of the transaction date. They also include the fair values of any recognised assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration agreement. Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which are identifiable within the scope of a company merger are measured at their fair values as of the date of their acquisition when first included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nAny costs associated with their acquisition are recognised as expenses as of the date of their accrual.\n\nAny contingent considerations are measured at fair value as of the date of their acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of an asset or a contingent consideration classified as a liability are measured within the scope of IFRS 9 and any resulting profit or loss is recognised either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nstatements 6 Further In\n\n# 6 Further Information\n\n→ Notes: A. General disclosures\n\nGoodwill is the value resulting from the surplus of the acquisition costs plus the value of the non-controlling interests in the acquired company and the fair value of any equity interests previously held as of the date of acquisition divided by the Group's interest in the net assets measured at fair value.\n\nIn case of the additional purchase of interests in companies already fully included in the scope of consolidation, this does not affect net income. This does not lead to any changes in the recognition of assets, liabilities and goodwill of the company already included in the scope of consolidation. The annual goodwill impairment tests are performed using the discounted cash flow method. This is calculated on the basis of future expected cash flows from the latest management planning, updated with long-term turnover growth rates as well as assumptions regarding margin and earnings trends and discounted in the value of the capital costs for the corporate unit. Testing is carried out at the level of the cash-generating unit. In the course of the year, an impairment test is also performed in case of events suggesting a permanent fall in value.\n\nIntragroup turnover, expenses and income and also loans, receivables and liabilities between the consolidated companies are eliminated. Interim profits from intragroup deliveries are consolidated insofar as they are significant for presentation of the actual net assets, financial position and results of operations. Intragroup deliveries and services are calculated on the basis of market prices and also on the basis of transfer prices determined according to the arm's length principle. Where necessary, deferred taxes are calculated for consolidation entries affecting earnings.\n\nStock option plans have been measured at fair value as issued equity instruments for future work, in accordance with IFRS 2. The resulting effects have been apportioned as expense throughout the period, recognised in personnel expenses and entered against equity. Insofar as the terms of options are not fulfilled, this item is reversed directly within equity.\n\nCompanies which are no longer classifiable as companies to be included in the scope of consolidation have been excluded accordingly. The relevant date is determined on the basis of the date of this company's withdrawal, i.e. the date of loss of control over its financial and business policy. Expenses and income resulting for the consolidated company up to its disposal are included in the consolidated profit and loss account. All of the assets and liabilities representing the consolidated company immediately prior to its withdrawal from the scope of consolidation will be considered as the disposal value. The effect on income of removal from the scope of consolidation is calculated by comparing the disposal or liquidation proceeds and the disposal value. The same consolidation methods have been used as in the previous year.\n\n#### 5 Currency translation\n\nThe annual financial statements of the foreign Group companies have been translated into euros according to the functional currency concept. Since the subsidiaries conduct their business independently in financial, economic and organisational terms, in principle the respective functional currency is identical with the national currency of the company in question. The reporting currency and functional currency of the Group is the euro.\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign companies included in the scope of consolidation are translated at the mid-market spot rates on the balance sheet date (balance sheet exchange rate), while income and expenses are translated at the average annual mean rates of exchange (profit and loss account exchange rate).\n\nGoodwill resulting for foreign subsidiaries as a result of capital consolidation is carried at historical cost.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\neholders 3 Combined Management Rep\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>130</sup> → Notes: A.

Accounting and measurement principles\n\n## 6 General disclosures\n\nIn principle, as in the previous year the annual financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared on the basis of uniform accounting and measurement methods. Accounting and measurement options are exercised in the consolidated financial statements in the same way as in the annual financial statements.\n\nFor preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Management requires a series of assessments and estimates and makes assumptions affecting the application of accounting principles within the Group and also recognition of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. The actual amounts may deviate from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are continuously reviewed. The following estimates and associated assumptions may affect the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIf items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are acquired within the scope of company mergers, the fair value of these assets as of the date of acquisition and the expected useful life are estimated. Fair values and useful lives are calculated on the basis of the management's assessments.\n\nImpairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are determined on the basis of estimates regarding the cause, the date and the value of these impairments and, where permissible, revaluations. Indications of impairments, estimates of future cash flows and fair values of assets are evaluated on the basis of assessments regarding expected cash flows, useful lives, discount rates and residual values. The development of future cash flows is mainly determined by the future demand trend for products. If the actual demand trend falls short of expectations, this would negatively affect turnover and cash flows. Further expenses for valuation adjustments might thus result which would negatively affect future results of operations.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nTo deal with the default risk for receivables, as well as provisioning for credit risk (expected credit loss) valuation adjustments are established for doubtful accounts. Provisioning for credit risk is determined on the basis of the maturity structure, the current market situation and past experience. In the event of a deterioration in customers' financial situation, the actual bad debts may exceed the expected bad debts.\n\nThe CEWE Group is obliged to pay income taxes in various countries (chiefly in Europe). Material assumptions are therefore necessary for calculation of Group-wide income tax liabilities. Income taxes are determined by calculating for each taxable entity the expected actual amount of income tax and the deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences between the balance sheet items in the consolidated financial statements and the accounts prepared for tax purposes. This requires assumptions for interpretation of applicable tax regulations in Germany and other countries. This also requires an assessment of the possibility of realising a sufficiently high level of taxable income for each type of tax and in each tax jurisdiction. For some transactions and calculations, the final level of taxation cannot be conclusively determined. The Group assesses the value of accruals for expected tax audits on the basis of estimates of whether additional income taxes may fall due and the respective amount. Insofar as the final level of taxation for these transactions deviates from the initially assumed level of taxation, this will affect the actual and deferred taxes in the period in which the level of taxation is conclusively determined. If the final values (in the areas affected by estimates) were to deviate from the management's estimates by 10 %, the Group would be required to increase its tax liabilities by 768 thousand euros and its deferred tax liability by 159 thousand euros, in case of a negative deviation, or reduce its tax liabilities by 768 thousand euros and its deferred tax liability by 159 thousand euros in case of a positive deviation. Pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial procedures. These measurements are mainly based on assumptions regarding discount factors, salary and pension trends and life expectancies. Pensions and similar obligations may be subject to significant changes if these assumptions significantly deviate from actual trends due to changes in the market and economic environment.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of other accruals and contingent liabilities are highly dependent on the complexity of the underlying transaction as well as estimates. This requires assumptions regarding the probability of realisation and the value of the claim. This in turn depends on past experience, assessments of cost trends and the assessment of other information. Changes in these estimates may have a significant effect on results of operations.\n\nIndividual items have been summarised in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. They are reported separately in the notes. The Group classifies assets and liabilities as current if they are expected to be realised or settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### 7 Recognition of income and expenses\n\nThe ordinary activities of the CEWE Group comprise photofinishing and other printing services and trading of photographic hardware as well as photofinishing products and services. CEWE mainly realises revenues from the sale of goods and does so only marginally from the provision of services. Any income associated with the Group's ordinary activities is presented as revenue in the profit and loss account. All other income is presented as other operating income (cf. C28, **[page 139](#page-140-0)**). Revenues are recognised on the basis of a five-step model. Amounts which are expected as consideration for the transfer of goods to or for the provision of services for a customer must thus be recognised as revenues. Turnover will be realised where (or once) the power of disposal over goods or services has been transferred to a customer, either over a period of time or at a point in time. Operating expenses are recognised in profit or loss upon use of the service or as of the time at which they are incurred. In principle, turnover-related expenses or accruals are measured as of the date of realisation of the corresponding revenues; this includes estimated amounts for rebates and discounts and other sales deductions. Interest income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\nB. Accounting and measurement principles\n\n#### 8 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognised at cost and, in case of wear and tear, less scheduled straight-line depreciation. In the Commercial Online Printing business unit, the units-of-production depreciation method is used for offset printing machines. Production costs comprise all directly attributable costs as well as appropriate portions of the production-related overheads. Financing costs are capitalised. The profits or losses resulting from the write-off of the asset are calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the book value and are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income or expenses in the period in which this item is written off.\n\n#### 9 Lease accounting\n\nFor leases, as of initial recognition CEWE recognises a liability in the amount of the present value of the existing payment obligation, restated for lease payments reported as assets or liabilities. Variable lease payments only arise to a minor extent. The effective interest method is applied for subsequent accounting. For the present value calculation, discounting is implemented by means of a risk- and term-equivalent incremental borrowing rate of interest if it is not possible to determine the implicit interest rate. The shortterm portion of the lease liability which is shown separately in the balance sheet is calculated by means of the repayment portion of the lease payments over the next twelve months.\n\nCEWE measures all rights of use resulting from leases at amortised cost. Straight-line depreciation is recognised over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the identified asset. If events or changed circumstances point to the possibility of impairment, impairment testing will be implemented according to IAS 36.\n\nLease accounting is mainly influenced by the assessment of the term. All facts and circumstances which provide an economic incentive for the exercise of existing options are taken into consideration in order to determine the term of the lease. The assumed term therefore includes periods covered by extension options if the exercise of options can be assumed to be reasonably probable.\n\n## 10 Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties comprise land and buildings which are held in order to generate rental income or for capital appreciation and are not used for separate production, for delivery of goods or provision of services, for administrative purposes or for sale within the scope of ordinary activities.\n\nAs of their first-time measurement these assets are measured at amortised cost, including incidental costs. Within the scope of subsequent measurement, investment properties are recognised at amortised cost.\n\nInvestment properties are written off if they are sold or permanently no longer used and if no future economic benefit is expected as of their disposal. Profits or losses resulting from the shutdown or disposal of investment properties are recognised in the year of this shutdown or disposal.\n\nItems of real estate are assigned to the portfolio of investment properties in case of a change of use involving the end of the Group's own use or the beginning of an operating lease as a landlord with another party.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\nB.

In case of any such indications, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the scope of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset, unless an asset results in cash inflows which are not largely independent of those of other assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating units). In this case, the calculation will be performed at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the respective asset has been assigned. The respective value will be assigned to the individual cash-generating units or to the smallest group of cash-generating units on an appropriate and consistent basis.\n\n## 11 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill does not undergo scheduled amortisation and is tested for impairment once a year. It is also tested whenever events occur which indicate potential impairment.\n\n#### 12 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets comprise industrial property rights and similar rights, software acquired for consideration, proprietary software, customer bases and lists, trademark rights and advance payments made on such assets. Acquired and proprietary intangible assets are capitalised subject to the conditions laid down in IAS 38 \"Intangible Assets\".\n\nIntangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalised at cost, as are proprietary intangible assets which are expected to provide a future benefit for the Group and which can be reliably determined and measured. Both types of intangible assets undergo scheduled straight-line depreciation over their expected useful life. Production costs comprise all directly attributable costs as well as appropriate portions of the productionrelated overheads. Financing costs are not capitalised, since the Group does not have any assets which involve a protracted production/manufacturing phase. Other development costs are likewise not capitalised, since the conditions for capitalisation are not generally fulfilled. Intangible assets undergo impairment if the recoverable amount – the higher of the fair value less disposal costs and the asset's value in use – is less than the book value. Impairment is recognised under \"Amortisation of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment\". Proprietary intangible assets mainly comprise new developments in the field of distribution- and production-specific software systems which can be used throughout the Group.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nport 4 Remuneration\n\n→ Notes: B. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nIn case of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intangible assets which cannot be used yet, an impairment test is performed at least annually and in case of any indication of impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less disposal costs and the value in use.\n\nFor calculation of the value in use, the future cash flows resulting from continued use of the cash-generating units are discounted by a risk-adjusted interest rate. The cash flows are determined on the basis of the planning which has been approved by the Board of Management and is valid at the time of the impairment test. This planning is based on expectations of future market shares, growth on the respective markets and products' profitability. Cash flow forecasts beyond the detailed planning period are calculated on the basis of suitable growth rates. The planning period is five years. These include both the current market assessment regarding the fair value of the money and the risks to which the respective asset is exposed, if these factors have not already been reflected in the estimate of the cash flows. Before taxes, the risk-adjusted interest rates used for discounting of cash flows amount to between 5.7 % and 11.6 % in the Photofinishing business unit, to between 7.5 % and 9.2 % in the Retail business unit and to between 9.2 % and 12.2 % in the Commercial Online Printing business unit. The risk-adjusted interest rate for the cash-generating units is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is determined on the basis of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), with due consideration of current market expectations. Specific peer group information for beta factors, capital structure data and the cost of borrowing are used to calculate the risk-adjusted interest rate for the purpose of the impairment test. Periods not included in the planning are reflected by means of a terminal value. Various sensitivity analyses are also performed. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit falls below its book value, impairment is recognised in the amount of the difference. If the value in use is less than the book value, for the calculation of the recoverable amount the fair value less the disposal costs will also be determined.\n\nThe impairment loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss. In the event of a recovery of the impairment loss, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit will be increased to the newly determined recoverable amount. However, the increased book value may not exceed the book value which would have been determined (less scheduled depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous years. A recovery in value is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill does not undergo any scheduled amortisation and is tested for impairment on the basis of the recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit to which it has been assigned. For this purpose, the goodwill acquired through a merger will be assigned to each individual cash-generating unit which is expected to realise synergies as a result of the merger. The maximum size of the respective cash-generating unit corresponds to the operating business unit which is included in internal reporting submitted to the main decision-making entity and thus reflects the internal reporting structure. The impairment test is performed at least once a year and also in case of any indication of impairment of the cash-generating unit.\n\nIn the event that the book value of the cash-generating unit to which this goodwill has been assigned exceeds its recoverable amount, amortisation will be recognised on this assigned goodwill in the value of the difference determined. Goodwill amortisation already recognised may not be reversed. If the difference determined for the cash-generating unit exceeds the book value of the assigned goodwill, the book values of the assets assigned to the cash-generating unit will undergo pro rata impairment in the value of the remaining impairment loss.\n\n#### 14 Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets have been measured at fair value. CEWE reviews whether objective indications of impairment are applicable on each balance sheet date. Reinsurance policies included in financial assets are recognised at their actuarial present value. This does not involve plan assets.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes: B. Accounting and measurement principles\n\n#### 15 Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets held for sale comprise assets or groups of assets whose book values within the next twelve months are expected to be mainly realised through their disposal and not through their operational use. They are measured at the lower of their book value and their fair value less disposal costs. In the event of a subsequent increase in their fair value, a revaluation will be made in the value of the impairment recognised.\n\n#### 16 Inventories\n\nInventories are recognised at cost. Manufacturing costs include individual material and production costs as well as pro rata material and production overheads. Administrative costs are included where attributable to production. Acquired inventory items are measured on the basis of the average value method, at the weighted average value. If the net disposal value is lower on the balance sheet date, this will be recognised. Inventories rarely used due to obsoleteness or technical progress are subject to marketability discounts. The Group does not have any long-term production orders.\n\n#### 17 Primary financial instruments\n\nPrimary financial instruments comprise financial assets (receivables, other assets, loans extended and cash and cash equivalents) as well as financial liabilities (interest-bearing financial liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities). They are accounted for and measured in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9. A financial instrument is thus recognised if a consideration is provided in the form of cash and cash equivalents or financial assets. In principle, it will be recognised and written off at fair value, allowing for the transaction costs. Non-interest-bearing receivables and other assets are discounted if they are non-current. In accordance with IFRS 9, subsequent measurement will depend on the following categorisation of the financial instruments.\n\n#### **Financial assets**\n\nFinancial interests recognised as financial assets are measured at fair value, with changes in value recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn principle, loans and receivables not quoted on an active market are measured at amortised cost. This includes non-current financial receivables, trade receivables and other current financial receivables and assets. In case of any doubt regarding the collectability of individual receivables, they will be recognised at the lower realisable amount. Objective defaults will result in a write-off of the relevant receivable. Otherwise, receivables are measured according to the expected loss method. Foreign-currency receivables are translated at the exchange rate as of the reporting date.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash in hand and balances in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as of the reporting date.\n\n#### **Financial liabilities**\n\nFinancial liabilities regularly establish an obligation for delivery in the form of cash and cash equivalents or another financial asset. This includes, in particular, trade payables, amounts owed to credit institutions, derivative financial liabilities and other financial liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n\n#### 18 Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, combined interest rate and foreign currency swaps and commodities futures transactions for hedging of exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price risks are used within narrowly defined limits. In accordance with the Group's risk management principles, no derivative financial instruments are held for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently at their market value. Profit and loss are recognised on the basis of the type of position to be hedged. Recognised measurement models are used in order to determine the market value. Derivatives for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised at fair value.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n19 Deferred taxes In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary discrepancies in terms of assets and liabilities in the tax and IFRS balance sheets, for tax credits and loss carry-forwards and for consolidation measures recognised in profit or loss. The national tax rates applicable as of the balance sheet date or applicable in future will be used for calculation purposes. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognised as of the respective change in the law coming into effect. Deferred tax assets resulting from loss carry-forwards are only included insofar as their realisation is sufficiently concrete and probable. In principle, changes in deferred taxes recognised in the balance sheet will result in deferred tax expenses or income. Insofar as items resulting in changes to deferred taxes are directly entered against equity, the\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are shown within the scope of accruals. They are calculated on the basis of the standard international balance sheet-based liability method and show the tax effects resulting from the valuation differences between the tax balance sheets of the individual companies and the consolidated financial statements. Neither deferred tax assets nor deferred tax liabilities are discounted.\n\nchange in deferred taxes will also be directly recognised in equity.\n\nThe deferral amounts are calculated at the tax rates which may currently be expected in case of a reversal of the temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax receivables and liabilities will be netted if they apply in relation to the same tax authority.\n\n#### **Average tax rates for calculation of deferred taxes** in %\n\n|                 | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| Germany         | 32.00 | 31.00 |\n| Belgium         | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| Denmark         | 22.00 | 22.00 |\n| France          | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| United Kingdom  | 19.00 | 19.00 |\n| Netherlands     | 25.80 | 25.80 |\n| Norway          | 22.00 | 22.00 |\n| Austria         | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| Poland          | 19.00 | 19.00 |\n| Sweden          | 20.60 | 20.60 |\n| Switzerland     | 23.00 | 23.00 |\n| Slovak Republic | 21.00 | 21.00 |\n| Czech Republic  | 19.00 | 21.00 |\n| Hungary         | 9.00  | 9.00  |\n| USA             | 21.00 | 21.00 |\n\n#### 20 Equity\n\nSubscribed capital is recognised within equity at its nominal value. The premium resulting from the first-time share issue is measured as a capital reserve on the basis of the difference between the nominal value of the ordinary bearer shares issued and the realised issue amount.\n\nThe subscribed capital and the capital reserve relate to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and are recognised as if held by this company. Through the treasury shares item deducted from equity on the face of the balance sheet, treasury shares are reported as a deduction at the value of their full, original acquisition costs and incidental acquisition\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>136</sup>\n\n→ Notes: B.

As well as earnings calculated according to provisions of commercial law, these items include the discrepancies in relation to IFRS accounting standards. Effects resulting from the fair value measurement of equity instruments, hedging transactions and stock option plans (see item D 51, **[pages 159 ff.](#page-160-0)**) are also shown, as are the currency translation differences and actuarial gains and losses recognised directly in equity. The change in hidden reserves recognised within the scope of successive share purchases is apportioned to retained earnings.\n\n#### 21 Pension commitments\n\nPension accruals are calculated in accordance with the actuarial projected unit credit method prescribed in IAS 19 for defined-benefit pension obligations. The future obligation is discounted to its present value on the basis of the vested rights acquired up to the balance sheet date, while allowing for additional parameters. Discrepancies between estimates made and actual trends and changes in actuarial assumptions will result in actuarial gains and losses. These will be directly recognised in equity in the year of their occurrence. The current service cost and the interest expenses included in pension expenses are recognised in personnel expenses.\n\nThese figures only refer to the group of employees entitled to pensions for which a pension liability must be carried.\n\nThe biometric probabilities are calculated according to the current \"Heubeck reference tables 2018 G\" or similar foreign mortality tables. Reinsurance policies have been concluded to a minor extent for some of the reported pension commitments.\n\n#### 22 Accruals\n\nAccruals are established insofar as a legal or constructive obligation has resulted from a past event. This is subject to the requirement that this obligation is expected to lead to a future outflow of assets which can be reliably estimated. In case of a level of probability which is greater than 50 %, the respective item will be recognised on the basis of the settlement amount with the highest possible probability of realisation. Accruals for obligations which are not expected to already result in an outflow in the following year are recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected outflow, if such accruals are significant. The discount rates correspond to the normal capital market rates. The value of the accruals is reviewed on each balance sheet date.\n\n#### 23 Share-based payment\n\nIFRS 2 is complied with in respect of the balance-sheet treatment of stock option plans. The fair value of the options as of the grant date is determined upon the basis of market prices (prices of Deutsche Börse AG, Frankfurt) with consideration of the terms of issue as well as generally recognised valuation techniques for financial instruments. The exercise price, the respective term, the current market value of the option instrument (the CEWE share), the expected level of volatility for the market price, the expected dividends on the shares and the risk-free interest rate for the terms of the options are included for the purpose of this valuation. Moreover, as specific requirements for the exercise of the option the beneficiaries comply with the necessary waiting period (lockup period) and, where applicable, exercise the option as early as possible. In the following financial reporting, the determined value of the stock options is apportioned to the term as expense, with consideration of the assumed service period and the level of fluctuation in the beneficiaries. Option premiums received within the scope of the options issued are recognised in retained earnings.\n\n#### 24 Research and non-capitalisable development costs\n\nResearch and non-capitalisable development costs are recognised in profit or loss at the time of their occurrence.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\n```\nB.

Contingent liabilities may also result from a present obligation which is attributable to past events but has not been recognised in the balance sheet because\n\n- the outflow of resources providing an economic benefit upon fulfilment of this obligation is not probable or\n- the value of this obligation cannot be estimated sufficiently reliably.\n\nIf the outflow of resources providing an economic benefit for the company is not probable, no contingent liability will be disclosed.\n\nContingent assets are not shown in the balance sheet and will only be indicated if the accrual of an economic benefit is probable. They include possible assets which result from past events and whose existence on account of the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events – over which the company lacks complete control – is yet to be confirmed.\n\n#### 26 Government grants\n\nGovernment grants which are paid by way of compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or by way of immediate financial support, without related future expense, are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account in the period in which the relevant entitlement arises.\n\n## C.

Retrospectively applicable discounts are frequently agreed here which are based upon the overall turnover within a given period. The proceeds from these sales are recognised at the price stated in the contract, less the agreed discounts. A reimbursement liability (reported under trade payables) is recognised for discounts which are expected to be payable to the customer for sales completed up to the end of the reporting period. Sales via mailorder shipping are recognised in Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing, mainly on the basis of prepayment. The retail stores operated by CEWE sell photographic hardware as well as photofinishing products. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately upon the customer's purchase of the product and acceptance of delivery in the retail store. Other revenues which have not resulted from the delivery or provision of typical goods, merchandise and services (the ordinary activities of the CEWE Group) are shown as other operating income. As of the reporting date, there are no contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised asset or services to the customer and the payment made by the customer is greater than one year. Accordingly, the promised consideration has not been restated on the basis of the time value of money.\n\n### 28 Other operating income\n\n#### **Other operating income** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                 | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rental income                                   | 3,808  | 4,159  |\n| Other revenues from sales to third parties      | 6,969  | 4,145  |\n| Income from pass-through expenses               | 3,604  | 3,258  |\n| Income from currency translation                | 2,425  | 2,429  |\n| Reimbursement of costs own personnel            | 1,384  | 2,334  |\n| Income from the reversal of accruals            | 3,689  | 2,012  |\n| Income from default charges                     | 757    | 760    |\n| Income from the receipt of impaired receivables | 1,461  | 426    |\n| Income from insurance indemnification           | 96     | 188    |\n| Additional other operating income               | 4,964  | 5,783  |\n| Total other operating income                    | 29,157 | 25,494 |\n\nOther revenues from sales to third parties comprise revenues from sales of aluminium from the resale of the printing plates used in offset printing and revenue from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn particular, income from pass-through expenses includes passed-on charges for sales aids, advertising services and logistics and other transport services.\n\nIncome from the release of accruals comprises various individual items within the scope of ordinary activities.

Reserves are entered for them in equity. On the structure of the stock option plans, we refer to the comments regarding the Group's equity (see item D 51, **[pages 159 ff.](#page-160-0)**). A Monte Carlo simulation has been used for these measurements. A log-normal distribution-based process has been simulated for the price of the CEWE share so as to map the performance target in the form of an increase in the average closing price on the underlying price on ten consecutive trading days.\n\nThe simulations also included the possibility of early exercise – with due consideration of the respective exercise windows – and also the beneficiaries' early exercise behaviour, in line with a modified version of the approach proposed by Hull and White. The simulation assumed that, upon expiry of the lockup period, every year through a 3.00 % exit rate stock options are exercised immediately upon this becoming possible due to the beneficiary leaving the company. A risk-free interest rate was assumed for the period up to the key date of December 30 of the relevant year. The calculation used discrete dividends; publicly available estimates were used as the basis for calculation. Finally, the historical level of volatility was considered and recognised for December 30 of the current year. The Group did not make any direct support payments.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\ntments\n\nO Particle\n\n→ Notes: C.

The scheduled depreciations indicated here and the non-scheduled depreciations of fixed assets are shown in the profit and loss account under amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. On the basis of impairment tests, non-scheduled depreciation on equipment with limited usability for technical reasons has been recognised in the amount of 1,209 thousand euros (previous year: 45 thousand euros).\n\nThe book value of property, plant and equipment used only temporarily is of lesser importance. The same applies for property, plant and equipment which is definitively no longer used. It is assumed that the fair value of property, plant and equipment does not significantly deviate from its book value. The Group does not have any pledged property, plant and equipment. Obligations for the purchase of property, plant and equipment (commitments) amount to 9,532 thousand euros (previous year: 17,943 thousand euros).\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration | 5 Financial Statements | 6 Further

In accordance with IAS 40, these buildings no longer used by the Group are measured at amortised cost. The underlying expected useful lives for scheduled straight-line depreciation are between 25 and 50 years. Additions in the financial year relate to subsequent acquisition costs in the amount of 317 thousand euros (previous year: 2,419 thousand euros). In the financial year, rent income amounted to 2,512 thousand euros (previous year: 2,440 thousand euros). Including depreciation, maintenance and incidental costs, expenses for the leased properties amounted to 2,046 thousand euros (previous year: 1,668 thousand euros).\n\nThe fair value of these investment properties is 26,574 thousand euros (previous year: 30,173 thousand euros).

Within the scope of the impairment test, the recoverable amount is determined by calculating the value in use. Cash flow forecasts are used for this purpose which are based on the approved business planning figures. In the detailed planning period for the main items of goodwill, an average annual rate of turnover growth of approx. 5.5 % (previous year: 5.8 %) is assumed in the Photofinishing business unit and 4.8 % (previous year: 8.2 %) in the Commercial Online Printing business unit. Cash flows are extrapolated beyond a period of five years on the basis of the growth\n\nrates indicated below. The planning is based on past experience, the current performance of the business and the best possible estimates of key trends affecting individual factors such as the development of procurement prices or market growth.\n\nIn the following, the long-term growth rate and discount rate is indicated for the valuein-use calculation for each cash-generating unit with significant goodwill.

Nonetheless, revised assumptions or changed circumstances may necessitate corrections which may lead to additional valuation adjustments or, in case of a reversal in the envisaged trends, reversals in value if this does not involve goodwill.\n\nWithin the scope of a sensitivity analysis for cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been assigned, a 10 % reduction in EBIT margins for the perpetual annuity and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate have been assumed. For the cash-generating unit DeinDesign, an increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 409 thousand euros impairment of the book value for goodwill. For the cash-generating unit Cheerz, an increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 1,761 thousand euros impairment of the book value for goodwill. On this basis, no impairment requirement applies for the cash-generating units or for the group of cash-generating units.\n\n## 39 Intangible assets\n\nSoftware and similar industrial property rights comprise purchased ERP software, various office products for workstations and newly and subsequently capitalised items for proprietary intangible assets, for internal use and to support the market in the areas of production, distribution and Commercial Online Printing. Within the scope of the Group's proprietary software, own work has been capitalised at a value of 596 thousand euros (previous year: 518 thousand euros).\n\nOn the basis of impairment tests, non-scheduled amortisation reflecting new information has been recognised in the amount of 757 thousand euros on acquired software (Photofinishing business unit) and 29 thousand euros (Commercial Online Printing business unit) on internally generated intangible assets (previous year: 14 thousand euros (Commercial Online Printing business unit)).\n\nFor intangible assets, the Group had commitments in the amount of 510 thousand euros (previous year: 936 thousand euros).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Acquisition and production costs**\n\n**Depreciation**\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration | 5 Financial Statements | 6 Further Information |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n\n→ Notes: D.

Direct losses on trade receivables are also shown in the other operating expenses item; in the past financial year, they amounted to 466 thousand euros (previous year: 407 thousand euros).\n\nCEWE applies the simplified approach according to IFRS 9 in order to measure the expected credit losses; accordingly, the credit losses envisaged over the course of the period are taken into consideration for all trade receivables. In order to measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are aggregated on the basis of common credit risk characteristics and the number of days overdue. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles for turnover over a period of 36 months prior to December 31, 2022 and the related historical losses in this period. The historical loss rates are restated in order to reflect current and prospective information which affects customers' capacity to settle claims. In the past financial year, customer receivables of CEWE Norge AS, Oppegård, Norway, with a book value of 138 thousand euros (previous year: 95 thousand euros) were pledged. They will be finally written off once the write-off rules under IFRS 9 are fulfilled.\n\nThis mainly comprises refund claims for tax prepayments made in the current year for the year under review.\n\n## 46 Current financial assets\n\nCurrent financial assets include the following items:\n\n#### **Current financial assets** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Creditors with debit accounts                  | 345           | 283           |\n| Receivables from employees                     | 315           | 355           |\n| Other current financial receivables and assets | 2,462         | 2,536         |\n| Total                                          | 3,122         | 3,174         |\n\n#### 47 Other current receivables and assets\n\n#### **Other current receivables and assets** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                          | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Current prepaid expenses                 | 6,548         | 7,057         |\n| Tax refund claims                        | 5,354         | 5,193         |\n| Current receivables from insurance firms | 0             | 12            |\n| Total                                    | 11,902        | 12,262        |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n5 Financial Statements 6 Further\n\n→ Notes: D.

Comments on the balance sheet\n\nAll of these plans have the same structure. Each of these stock option plans has a term of five years. Upon expiry of a four-term waiting period (lockup period), the options may be exercised in the fifth year of the term. Their exercise is contingent upon achievement of the performance target, i.e. if the closing auction prices of the CEWE share in Deutsche Börse AG's Xetra trading system have at least reached (if not exceeded) the underlying price plus the applicable performance premium on ten consecutive stock exchange trading days.\n\nThe options are only exercisable and shares resulting from the option deal are only subsequently saleable within six four-week exercise periods. These exercise periods will begin as of publication of the earnings for the past financial year, as of the balance sheet The terms of the current stock option plans are as follows: press conference, as of the annual general meeting and as of the date of publication of\n\n#### **Structure of stock option plans**\n\n#### the quarterly figures.

KGaA as well as other Group companies in Germany and other countries, at a premium of 0.50 euros per option. The number of options offered is limited. A maximum of 1,200 options are available for a member of the Board of Management, while for other executives and experts a lower number of options are available, depending on their management level and their proximity to the company's success.\n\nThe terms of the current stock option plans are as follows:\n\n|          |                      | Number of<br>participants | Number of<br>rights issued | Start of<br>waiting period | End of<br>waiting period | End of<br>exercise period | Underlying price<br>euros/option | Performance<br>premium<br>in % | Performance<br>target<br>euros/option |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| SOP 2023 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2024               | Dec. 31, 2027            | Dec. 31, 2028             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 27                        | 20,250                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 34                        | 28,650                     |                            |                          |                           | 87.00                            | 120                            | 104.40                                |\n| SOP 2022 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2023               | Dec. 31, 2026            | Dec. 31, 2027             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 76.00                            | 120                            | 91.20                                 |\n| SOP 2021 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2022               | Dec. 31, 2025            | Dec. 31, 2026             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 121.00                           | 120                            | 145.20                                |\n| SOP 2019 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2020               | Dec. 31, 2023            | Dec. 31, 2024             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 81.00                            | 125                            | 101.25                                |\n|          |                      |                           |                            |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n\n**1** Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6.

KGaA (415 thousand euros) and the profit from the sale of treasury shares (12,689 thousand euros).\n\nThe capital reserve includes the fair value of the stock options issued for the stock plans which have been added to the capital reserve pro rata between the issue date and the maturity of the stock option plans, plus the withheld premiums.

The company's pension scheme is based on a defined-benefit system and also, to a marginal extent, on a defined-contribution system. Employees are also able to participate in schemes for the conversion of salary entitlements into pension entitlements. Accruals are measured on the basis of the projected unit credit method.\n\nIn the case of the defined-benefit scheme, the company or an external pension provider grants the beneficiaries a defined-benefit commitment; unlike in the case of defined contributions, the expenses incurred by the company are not determined in advance. In Germany, the company's commitments to the Board of Management are structured as final salary plans; in addition, several executives have been granted fixed-benefit commitments. In France, capital commitments in accordance with the employee's period of service are granted. Until 2021, these were in some cases covered by reinsurance policies. Expenses for these commitments are apportioned across the service period of the employees, on the basis of actuarial calculations, and must be broken down into the current service cost and interest expense (the balance of interest on the obligation and income from the cover funds) in accordance with IAS 19. On the respective balance sheet date (December 31 of each year), the interest rate is determined on the basis of current capital market data as well as assumptions regarding long-term trends, in accordance with the principle of the best possible estimate. CEWE has several defined-benefit plans. As a rule, it has provided aggregated details for these plans, since there are no significant deviations in terms of their respective risk exposure. Through its plans in Germany and France, the Group is generally exposed to the following actuarial risks: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.\n\nInvestment risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is calculated by means of a discount rate which is determined on the basis of the yields provided by high-quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds. If the income from the plan assets is less than this interest rate, this will result in shortage of cover for the plan.\n\nInterest rate risk: a decrease in the discount rate will result in an increase in the Group's liability under the plan.\n\nLongevity risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is determined on the basis of the best possible estimate of the probability of death of the beneficiary employees, both during the employment relationship and thereafter. An increase in the life expectancy of beneficiary employees will result in an increase in the liability under the plan.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\nSalary risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is determined Overall, the Group's financing status is as follows: on the basis of the future salaries of beneficiary employees. An increase in the salaries of beneficiary employees will thus result in an increase in the liability under the plan.\n\nNo other benefits for these employees are envisaged upon termination of their employment relationships.\n\nThe company does not have any plan assets within the meaning of IAS 19 to cover these benefits in any of the countries in question.\n\nOn the other hand, in case of defined contributions firmly defined contributions (e.g. in relation to the applicable level of income) are confirmed and paid.

As of the reporting date, the loans taken up have a term of between one and one and a half years (previous year: between one and two and a half years). At the end of the year, the total credit line of the CEWE Group amounted to 91.0 million euros (previous year: 153.0 million euros); this decrease is attributable to the repayment according to schedule of lines of credit no longer required on a long-term basis. After deducting the total loan volume drawn down (0.87 million euros, previous year: 0.84 million euros) – this does not involve a drawdown which is relevant for liquidity purposes and instead comprises the amount deducted by the credit institutions for the guarantees provided – and allowing for the company's existing liquidity (117.37 million euros, previous year: 73.07 million euros), its liquidity potential totalled 207.50 million euros (previous year: 225.23 million euros). The company has long-term revolving credit lines which have been granted for up to 1.5 years as well as continuously renewed one-year lines and lines of credit made available until further notice whose overall purpose is financing of the company's liquidity requirements, which fluctuate strongly over the course of a given year due to seasonal factors. In principle, no restrictions apply in relation to the use of credit lines. This ensures that CEWE will be able to fulfil its payment obligations.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll long-term credit commitments are subject to normal bank agreements. No financial covenants have been agreed. No significant collateral was provided. The interest terms for current account loans are based on €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany; the interest terms for almost all of the other financing arrangements are based on the one- to three-month EURIBOR as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany.

In particular, these risks comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit risks. The Group's management manages and limits these risks. They are monitored by means of the Group-wide risk management system.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of the Group being unable to fulfil its financial obligations. This risk is dealt with by means of liquidity planning and cash management, through continuous monitoring and management of cash inflows and outflows. The main sources of liquidity are operating business and external financing. Cash outflows are mainly used for financing of working capital and investments.\n\nOf these credit lines, as of the reporting date 90.1 million euros (previous year: 152.2 million euros) have not been drawn down. As well as cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 117.4 million euros (previous year: 73.1 million euros), this amount is available for coverage of future liquidity requirements.

Currency risks result from turnover billed in a currency other than that of the related costs, the foreign-currency assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet whose fair value may be negatively influenced by a change in exchange rates and from pending foreign-currency transactions whose future cash flows may have a negative effect due to exchange rate changes. The risk management system continuously monitors the risk positions resulting from currency risks. To limit these risks, outside the scope of deliveries and services where possible the Group reduces the volume of euro-denominated transactions for companies in non-Eurozone countries. Following a detailed review process, the company enters into non-euro hedging transactions with its house banks on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe key market risk in the foreign-currency segment relates to currency positions which were open as of the reporting date. The Group's Swiss, Czech and British companies have significant foreign-currency items. For the purpose of the sensitivity analysis, the corresponding foreign-currency items are measured at hypothetical exchange rates. If these three foreign currencies were to depreciate against the euro by 20 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Currency sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets      | -40,670 | -80,192 |\n| Financial liabilities | 25,262  | 50,262  |\n\nIf these three foreign currencies were to appreciate against the euro by 20 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:):\n\n#### **Currency sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets      | -21,725 | -43,171 |\n| Financial liabilities | 31,997  | 63,124  |\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\n→ Notes: D. Comments on the balance sheet\n\nThe CEWE Group does not have any particularly significant exposure to interest rate risks in relation to third parties. Interest-rate-sensitive assets comprise loans to customers and employees as well as current balances held by credit institutions. CEWE does not have any interest-rate-sensitive financial liabilities as of the balance sheet date. No significant risk positions have resulted on account of the current interest rate trend. The goal of CEWE's interest rate hedging strategy is the regular conclusion of new medium- to longterm credit agreements with fixed interest rates. If the interest rates for variable interest-rate financial assets and financial liabilities were in each case to fall by 10 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                  | 2022 | 2023  |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Interest income  | -4.3 | -51.2 |\n| Interest expense | 44.8 | 45.8  |\n\nIf the interest rates for variable interest-rate financial assets and financial liabilities were in each case to increase by 10 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n| Interest income  | 4.3   | 51.2  |\n| Interest expense | -44.8 | -45.8 |\n\nNo hedging transactions have been entered into.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, financial assets measured at amortised cost resulted in net income/losses of 40 thousand euros (previous year: 42 thousand euros). Net income/ losses resulting from the financial instruments held comprise, in particular, valuation adjustments, income from written-down receivables and the results of the fair value measurement. Dividend income and interest are not included. Net income/losses resulting from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost amount to 1,946 thousand euros in the financial year 2023 (previous year: 1,544 thousand euros).\n\nInterest income associated with financial instruments not measured in profit and loss at fair value amounts to 512 thousand euros (previous year: 43 thousand euros), while corresponding interest expenses amount to 79 thousand euros (previous year: 39 thousand euros). Impairment of financial instruments measured at amortised cost amounted to 466 thousand euros in the past financial year (previous year: 407 thousand euros); this was recognised due to depreciation of receivables.\n\nInterest expense from lease liabilities is also included in the financial year, in the amount of 1,488 thousand euros (previous year: 1,094 thousand euros) (item C33, **[page 143](#page-144-0)**).\n\nThe reconciliation of the balance sheet items with these types of financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 is as

amortised cost; FVTOCI: at fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: at fair value through profit or loss\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets not measured in accordance with IFRS 9 comprise reinsurance policies. They are recognised at their actuarial present value. The book values of the other financial assets, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and the book values of current account liabilities, trade payables and other current financial liabilities each serve as a reasonable approximation of the respective fair values. This is mainly due to the short terms of these instruments. Risk-related valuation adjustments are considered for the calculation of book values. The Group does not have any financial receivables or liabilities held for trading purposes.\n\nCEWE measures fixed-interest and variable-interest receivables with a remaining term of more than one year on the basis of various parameters, e.g. the interest rate and the borrower's credit rating. On the basis of this measurement, any necessary valuation adjustments are included in the calculation of the book value. A fixed-interest agreement applies for current and non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities (with the exception of current account liabilities), so that here too the book value corresponds to the fair value.\n\nBook values are determined by means of normal bank methods.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations, resulting in a bad debt loss. In some cases and to a not insignificant degree, factoring is used as an instrument to minimise the credit risk. Within the scope of the Group's receivables management system, as a component of its risk management system, receivables at the level of the individual companies are subject to comprehensive monthly analysis and are notified to the Group's central management, at the level of its headquarters, as part of its del credere reporting. Loan security agreements are concluded for medium-size and major customers. If the Group does not have any insurance cover or if a deductible is applicable, individual valuation adjustments are recognised on receivables in case of objective indications that it is overwhelmingly probable that this receivable is uncollectable, either in whole or in part. The general default risk is dealt with by means of individual valuation adjustments on the basis of past experience. On December 31, 2023, the maximum credit risk resulting from debtors' potential insolvency in relation to loans and receivables amounted to 95,137 thousand euros (previous year: 102,248 thousand euros) and has the following makeup:\n\n#### **Credit risk** in thousands of euros\n\nD.

Comments on the balance sheet\n\nThese items are very closely monitored within the scope of the Group's receivables management system. On the basis of an assessment of the individual risks, partial valuation adjustments in the amounts indicated above are sufficient. Non-impaired financial assets are considered to be recoverable. Default risks are reduced by means of continuous monitoring of customers' credit ratings and payment behaviour, in close coordination with the company's market-oriented departments, and are covered by means of insurance, where possible. Moreover, in case of irregularities in customer relationships the volume of business is managed on the basis of individual decisions. Impairment of consumer receivables is minimised by means of a professional debt collection management system as well as risk avoidance and information-gathering parameters. These automatic system settings and the additional qualitative information serves as information which is used for calculation of individual valuation allowances.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, the BEPS Pillar 2 rules (German Act Transposing the Minimum Tax Directive, Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – MinBestRL-UmsG) were transposed into German law (German Act on Minimum Taxation, Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG) and entered into force upon publication in the German Federal Law Gazette on December 27, 2023. The provisions of the Act on Minimum Taxation apply for the first time for financial years beginning after December 30, 2023 and are therefore not yet applicable for the year under review. Even if these provisions had already been applicable, the CEWE Group would not have fallen under the scope of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation either in the year under review or in the financial year 2024, since the turnover threshold of 750 million euros in the consolidated financial statements for application of these provisions was exceeded for the first time in the year under review. This notwithstanding, CEWE expects to once again exceed the relevant turnover threshold in the financial year 2024 and thus assumes that the provisions of the MinStG will apply for the first time for the financial year 2025.\n\nIn the financial year 2024, the CEWE Group will therefore commence a project reviewing the impact in terms of the effects associated with a Pillar 2 top-up tax. It is not currently possible to quantity the potential additional tax burden. However, application of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation are not currently expected to lead to a significant additional tax burden, since the CEWE Group operates almost exclusively in countries whose nominal income tax burden exceeds 15 % and for which no tax burden at all, or only an insignificant tax burden, is therefore expected to arise.\n\nThe CEWE Group is closely monitoring the progress of the legislative process in every country where it operates. It will adapt its current reporting and compliance processes with a view to future local and central determination of the top-up tax burden as well as the future submission of a minimum tax report and filing of related tax returns in Germany and other countries.\n\nThe key equity items are presented below. Net interest-bearing financial liabilities have resulted from netting of gross interest-bearing financial liabilities against the Group's cash and cash equivalents as of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Key equity items** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                    | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total assets                                       | 632,706       | 665,963       |\n| Equity                                             | 362,763       | 389,239       |\n| Equity ratio (as %)                                | 57.3          | 58.4          |\n| Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | 116           | 0             |\n| Non-current liabilities from leasing               | 40,536        | 37,103        |\n| Current interest-bearing financial liabilities     | 214           | 77            |\n| Current liabilities from leasing                   | 9,717         | 9,468         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 73,067        | 117,369       |\n| Net interest-bearing financial liabilities         | -22,484       | -70,721       |\n\nThe primary goal of the CEWE Group's capital management system is to ensure that the Group remains capable of repaying its debts and maintains its financial resources. As well as safeguarding the long-term liquidity supply, the interest rate risk has been limited and a flexible credit structure has once again been maintained, to cover the seasonal nature of the Group's business performance over the course of the year.

Other disclosures\n\nThe cash flow statement shows how the Group's cash and cash equivalents have developed during the financial years 2023 and 2022. In accordance with IAS 7, this statement distinguishes between cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents shown comprise the balance sheet items bank balances with a remaining term of up to three months and cash in hand including fixed deposit balances. This corresponds to the cash and cash equivalents item presented in the balance sheet.\n\nThe potential effects of the continued inflation and the related impact on CEWE's course of business have been factored into the forecast, opportunities and risk report on the basis of the information currently available.\n\nIn order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 CEWE's subsidiary SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden, via an asset deal. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. No other events of particular significance have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n## 70 Events of particular significance after the balance sheet date\n\n71 Comments on the cash flow statement\n\nThe inflows and outflows resulting from the change in financial liabilities are attributable to repayments, reclassifications due to maturity periods and loans taken up as follows:\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2023** in thousands of euros\n\n|               | Current interest- bearing<br>financial liabilities | Non-current interest-<br>bearing financial liabilities | Gross financial<br>liabilities |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| As of Jan. 1  | 214                                                | 116                                                    | 330                            |\n| Repayment     | -137                                               | -116                                                   | -253                           |\n| As of Dec. 31 | 77                                                 | -0                                                     | 77                             |\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2022** in thousands of euros\n\n|               | Current interest-bearing financial liabilities | Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | Gross financial liabilities |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| As of Jan. 1  | 276                                            | 407                                                | 683                         |\n| Repayment     | -62                                            | -291                                               | -353                        |\n| As of Dec. 31 | 214                                            | 116                                                | 330                         |\n\n#### 72 Other financial obligations under lease agreements\n\nLeases and tenancies exist which constitute operating lease arrangements in terms of their economic content, so that the leasing assets are attributable to the lessor rather than CEWE Stiftung & Co.

In accordance with the internal reporting, revenues are reported according to consolidation effects.\n\nTurnover corresponds to the breakdown by geographical region shown in section C27, **[pages 138 f](#page-139-0)**.\n\nThese turnover categories are Photofinishing revenue, Retail revenue and revenue from Commercial Online Printing. A breakdown of these categories is provided in the segment reporting by business unit.

KGaA, Oldenburg\n\n### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\n#### **Audit Opinions**\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and its subsidiaries (the group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2023, the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn addition, we have audited the combined management report (report on the position of the company and the group) of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the combined management report listed in section \"Other information\".\n\nThe combined management report includes references not required by law which have been marked as unaudited. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited these references or the information to which these references relate.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the group as at December 31, 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and\n\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of those parts of the Combined management report listed in section \"Other information\". The combined management report includes references not required by law which have been marked as unaudited. Our audit opinion does not include these references or the information to which these references relate.\n\nPursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nl Statements 6 Further\n\n6 Further Information\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have identified the following matters as key audit matters which must be mentioned in our auditor's report:\n\n- 1. REALISATION OF TURNOVER IN THE PHOTOFINISHING SEGMENT\n- 2. FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IN THE COMMERCIAL ONLINE PRINTING AND PHOTOFINISHING BUSINESS UNITS\n\n#### Realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment\n\n#### **Specific issue**\n\nIn its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, the company has reported revenues in its Photofinishing segment in the amount of 659 million euros (84.4 % of total revenues). Due to the highly automated procedure through which these revenues are realised, the very large volume of data processed and the variety of IT systems due to the diverse product range, in our view particularly stringent requirements apply for the IT systems in terms of correct recognition of and accrual accounting for revenues. In view of this situation, the IT systems were particularly significant for us within the scope of our audit, in relation to the realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment.\n\nThe disclosures made by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA concerning revenues in the Photofinishing segment may be found in section \"C27\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Audit response**\n\nTo address the risk associated with the realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment, we have performed uniform audit procedures for all of the segments. We have assessed implementation of the Group rules on the realisation of turnover in the IT\n\nsystems in terms of whether the software in question is suitable to appropriately map the business transactions. As well as a basic audit, our audit approach includes functionbased testing of relevant check mechanisms as well as ad hoc and analytical audit procedures. In particular, we have evaluated whether the IT control system has been appropriately designed for the IT systems used throughout the Group for invoicing and their interfaces in relation to the relevant general ledger. To review the effectiveness of this IT control system, we have implemented control tests for the control activities implemented within the scope of these processes. We have consulted internal specialists in relation to these audit activities. We have also established on a sample basis that the accrual accounting for revenues has been correctly implemented.\n\n#### Fair value of goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing and Photofinishing business units\n\n#### **Specific issue**\n\nIn its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, the company has reported goodwill in the amount of 22.16 million euros in its Commercial Online Printing business unit and 59.62 million euros in its Photofinishing business unit.\n\nThe company tests goodwill for impairment once a year or on an ad hoc basis in order to determine a possible write-down requirement. In the financial year 2023 the company performed the annual impairment test.\n\nThis impairment test is carried out at the level of cash-generating units to which the respective goodwill is allocated. Within the scope of this impairment test, the book value of the respective cash-generating unit is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount. In principle, the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use. As a rule, the valuation is implemented on the basis of the present value of future cash flows for the respective cash-generating unit. The values in use are determined by means of the discounted cash flow method, in line with the Group's approved planning. Future cash flows beyond the detailed planning period are carried forward on the basis of long-term growth rates. Expectations regarding the future market trend and assumptions relating to the development of macroeconomic factors are taken into consideration here. Discounting is implemented by means of the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating unit.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nanalyses.\n\ntion and have checked the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and the model used. We have discussed with the Board of Management the Group's approved planning and the current forecast as well as the assumed long-term growth rates. We have developed an understanding of the underlying planning assumptions and the related growth rate assumptions by comparing them with past trends and current industry-specific market expectations. We have also critically examined the discount rates applied on the basis of the average cost of capital of a peer group. Our audit included the company's sensitivity\n\nWithin the scope of our audit, we have obtained an understanding of the planning process and have assessed its appropriateness. We have carried out an analysis of past planning and compared the planning of the past few years with the actual results and analysed any discrepancies. Moreover, with the assistance of our valuation specialists we have developed an understanding of the impairment testing method applied as well as the calcula-\n\n**Audit response**\n\nDisclosures from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA on goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing business unit may be found in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: A4 Consolidation principles, B6 General disclosures, B11 Goodwill, B13 Impairment, D. Comments on the balance sheet (development of the fixed assets) and D38 Goodwill.\n\nunit, the discount rates applied, the growth rates as well as further assumptions and is thus subject to considerable uncertainty. In this context and, in particular, in view of the uncertainty relating to course of business and the earnings trend in the light of the coronavirus pandemic, the fair value of goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing business unit was a particularly significant issue for our audit.\n\nThe calculation of the respective value in use is highly dependent on the company's legal representatives' assessment of the future cash inflows for the respective cash-generating\n\nThe executive directors or the supervisory board are responsible for the other\n\nreport\n\n**Other Information**\n\n• the separate consolidated non-financial report, published on the company's website,\n\n- to which reference is made in the \"Reports on the company's management\" section of the combined management report\n- the declaration on corporate governance contained in the \"Reports on the company's management\" section of the combined management report\n- the remaining parts of the annual report, with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and combined management report and our auditor's report.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and thereby acknowledge whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>190</sup>\n\n→ Independent auditor's\n\ninformation. The other information comprises:\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined management report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i. e. manipulations of the accounting and asset damage) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined management report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nlders 3 Combined Management Report\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards implemented to address any threats to independence. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We do not express any opinion on the information contained in this reproduction nor on any other information contained in the abovementioned file beyond this reasonable assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 contained in the \"Auditor's report on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report\" above.\n\n#### **Basis for the Reasonable Assurance Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report contained in the above-mentioned electronic file in accordance with § 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance in Accordance with § 317 (3a) HGB on the Electronic Reproduction of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised)]. Accordingly, our responsibilities are further described below in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has complied with the requirements of the IDW quality management standards which in turn implement the IAASB's international standards on quality management.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents**\n\nThe executive directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report in accordance with § 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\nImage /page/194/Picture/18 description: The image shows a navigation bar with the following options: 1 CEWE at a Glance, 2 To the Shareholders, 3 Combined Management Report, 4 Remuneration, 5 Financial Statements, and 6 Further Information.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinions.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i. e. whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documentation meets the require-ments of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the technical specification for this electronic file applicable at the reporting date.\n- Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n#### **Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the consolidated general meeting on June 7, 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on November 9, 2023. We have been the group auditor of the CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA without interruption since the financial year 2014.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n#### **Other matter – use of the auditor's report**\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be published in the Company Register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents provided in electronic form.\n\n#### German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Christoph Hyckel.\n\nHamburg, March 19, 2024\n\nBDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSabath Hyckel German Public Auditor German Public Auditor\n\nyckel\nerman Public Audito\n\n4 Remuneration\n\n→ Independent auditor's\n\nreport\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n3 Combined Management Report\n\n→ The CEWE Group – structure and executive bodies\n\n### <span id=\"page-196-0\"></span>The CEWE Group – structure and executive bodies\n\n#### Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\n\n#### **Board of Trustees**\n\n- Paolo Dell'Antonio, Braunschweig\n- Helmut Hartig, Oldenburg\n- Dr Kay Hafner, Essen\n- Matthias Peters, Hamburg\n- Katharina Le Thierry, Munich\n- Anke Röbke, Oldenburg (since January 1, 2023)\n- Jörg Waskönig, Saterland\n\n#### **Board of Management**\n\n- Yvonne Rostock, Ratingen (Chairwoman) (since March 1, 2023)\n- Patrick Berkhouwer, Bremen\n- Dr Reiner Fageth, Oldenburg\n- Carsten Heitkamp, Oldenburg\n- Dr Olaf Holzkämper, Oldenburg\n- Thomas Mehls, Oldenburg\n- Christina Sontheim-Leven, Düsseldorf (since January 1, 2022)\n\n## CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Or, as we like to say here at CEWE: \"We are not entirely dissatisfied.\"\n\n#### **All of our business units have contributed to this success**\n\nIn our main business unit, Photofinishing, turnover increased by 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros and thus enabled EBIT growth of 8.6 % to 80.0 million euros. It is notable that the CEWE Group once again achieved an increase in earnings in its critical Christmas business. All of our brands have contributed to this positive trend: CEWE of course, but also Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and WhiteWall. They are all integral components of our innovative photofinishing product range. Turnover also increased in CEWE's second-largest business unit, Commercial Online Printing, by 6.6 %. Earnings rose by 81 % to 4.2 million euros. This means that not only has this business unit returned to the black, it has also delivered a highly respectable EBIT margin for this business unit of 4.5 %.\n\nImage /page/2/Picture/14 description: A portrait shot of a middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.

The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting.\n\nYvonne Rostock Chairwoman of the Board of Management\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ The Board of Management\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>2</sup>\n\n# The Board of Management\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/6 description: A group of seven people are standing together in a well-lit indoor setting. The group consists of four men and three women, all dressed in business attire. The men are wearing suits, while the women are wearing a combination of suits and blouses. They are standing on or near a wooden staircase. The background includes a wall with a modern design element featuring yellow and clear panels. The overall impression is a professional and corporate atmosphere.\n\nFrom left to right: Patrick Berkhouwer, Christina Sontheim-Leven, Dr Reiner Fageth, Yvonne Rostock, Carsten Heitkamp, Thomas Mehls, Dr Olaf Holzkämper\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Foreword\n\n#### **Many thanks to all of CEWE's 4,000-strong team!**\n\nI would like to wholeheartedly thank all 4,000 members of our workforce for this positive performance. In 2023, once again this success didn't materialise all on its own – it reflects the effort made by the employees of the CEWE Group, who really \"put their back into it\". This is the only reason we are now seeing these presentable results. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to them!\n\n#### **This marks the continuation of a long, successful track record**\n\nWe are particularly pleased that many of these figures represent the continuation of long, successful track records. Leaving aside the pandemic-related upswing in 2020, since 2012 our EBIT figure has climbed in nice steady increments from 28.3 million euros to the above-mentioned 83.9 million euros in the past financial year. CEWE doesn't optimise things for a single year, and still less for a single quarter. CEWE is a long-distance runner and thinks in terms of long development cycles spanning a period of decades.\n\n#### **15th consecutive dividend increase planned**\n\nThe same is true of the company's dividend. As you will have gathered from our annual report, over a period of many years now, our avowed dividend policy is to achieve continuous growth in our dividend per share if the company's results permit this. We are naturally able to compensate for minor operational fluctuations in our results. We are therefore pleased to be able to present you with a proposal for a further dividend increase to 2.60 euros per share at our general meeting, which will be held on June 5, 2024. Should you support our proposal, this would represent our 15th consecutive dividend increase. In this case, CEWE would remain one of the top three listed companies in Germany with the most consecutive dividend increases up to the present day. We are delighted with this and are pleased to be continuing on this path with you.\n\nDear shareholders, make the most of the spring! Use the time for trips and travel and take plenty of photos along the way. Your company is ready to help if you would like to turn these photos into CEWE Group photo products.\n\nFor us this naturally means, as a German football manager once remarked, \"after the match is before the match\". Or more precisely: after Christmas is before Christmas. Your company had a very successful Christmas 2023 and is now building on this momentum as it prepares for the next peak season: Christmas 2024. We are already laying the foundations for the innovations we will be introducing over the course of the year, which will be available to you and our customers by Christmas at the latest.\n\nOn behalf of CEWE's Board of Management\n\nYvonne Rostoch\n\nYvonne Rostock\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>→ The CEWE Group\n\n\\$\\bigcirc\\$ < 4 >\n\n# The CEWE Group\n\nEurope's leading photo service and online printing provider\n\nThe CEWE Group is Europe's leading photo service and online printing provider.\n\nFrom its beginnings in 1912, CEWE has established itself as the first choice as a photo service for anyone looking to make more of their photos. The company's CEWE PHOTO-BOOK in particular stands for this, with multiple awards and around six million copies sold every year. Customers can obtain further personalised photo products through the brands CEWE, Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and White-Wall, for instance – and from many leading European retailers. These brand worlds inspire customers to produce a wide range of creative designs with their personal photos, and customers entrust the company with over 2 billion photos every year.\n\nIn addition, for the online printing market the CEWE Group has established a highly efficient production system for printed advertising media and business stationery. Billions of high-quality printing products reliably reach their customers via the distribution platforms SAXOPRINT, LASERLINE and viaprinto every year.\n\nThe CEWE Group is committed to a sustainable corporate management philosophy which is also supported by the Neumüllers, the company's founding family, and has been recognised with multiple awards: a long-term business focus; fair, partnership-based relationships with customers, employees and suppliers; and assuming social responsibility while pursuing an environmentally friendly approach and conserving resources.\n\nThe CEWE Group is present in 21 countries with 4,000 employees. The CEWE share is listed in the SDAX index.

The decade of the analogue/digital transformation follows from 2000 onwards: digital cameras become a mass market phenomenon and CEWE consolidates its market leadership in the digital photofinishing segment by making early adjustments to its production technology, its marketing activities and its product range and by developing the CEWE PHOTOBOOK brand. From 2010, CEWE achieved growth above all thanks to the consistent ongoing development and expansion of its Photofinishing core business unit. It also developed a new business unit, Commercial Online Printing, in this period.**\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n> Alongside Photofinishing, CEWE currently has around 100 of its own photo retail stores and directly markets photofinishing products in particular via this distribution channel. Besides this main activity which is reported in the Photofinishing business unit, CEWE's retail operations also generate earnings from photo hardware (cameras, lenses etc.) which are separately reported in the Retail business unit.\n\nOn the basis of the digital print capabilities which have been developed in its Photofinishing business unit through this process of transformation and by acquiring expertise in online offset printing, from 2009/2010 CEWE then turned its Commercial Online Printing business unit into a modern online printing service for business stationery. This additional business unit achieved rapid growth in subsequent years to reach a turnover volume of around 100 million euros.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the coronavirus pandemic had a particularly pronounced impact on the demand trend and the development of turnover in all of CEWE's business units: the \"stay-at-home\" effect back then had an especially positive effect on sales of photo products in Photofinishing, while the coronavirus restrictions and shuttering of businesses adversely affected the level of demand in the Commercial Online Printing and Retail business units. 2022 was shaped by things continuing to get back to normal in the context of coronavirus; above all, people increasingly travelled again, which also meant new photos. The recovery of business life also led to a significant rise in the level of demand for printed advertising media. Now that the coronavirus pandemic had been fully overcome, people once again travelled a great deal in 2023: the strong level of holiday travel led consumers to take a lot of new photos.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\ne 2. Combined Management Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nCEWE was able to convert this into its own business growth, thanks to the positioning of its brands as well as its marketing activities. In the financial year 2023 which has just ended, turnover reported according to the IFRS once again registered strong growth to 780.2 million euros: an increase of 47.5 million euros or 6.5 % (2022: 732.7 million euros). Including the turnover of futalis which was sold in late December and thus removed from the profit and loss account in accordance with IFRS 5, Group turnover thus calculated even increased to 788.8 million euros (Group turnover in 2022 incl. futalis: 741.0 million euros). For 2023, CEWE had envisaged Group turnover in a target range of between 720 and 780 million euros.\n\nA change in the product mix already occurred during the analogue/digital transformation in the Photofinishing core business unit, and to some extent this continues right up to the present day: at the start of the digitalisation\n\n# **780.2 million euros**\n\n#### Turnover volume in 2023\n\nprocess, consumers continued to request individual photo prints. While they had previously done so for analogue film, they now did so for digital image formats. With these digital product innovations, demand then shifted away from these simple (low-margin) photo prints to highermargin \"added-value products\" such as CEWE PHOTO-BOOK, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and many other photo gifts. Above all, this change in the Photofinishing product mix resulted in a constantly rising\n\n**Long-term development of turnover EBIT development** (EBIT in millions of euros)\n\n- Strong EBIT in 2023: at 83.9 million euros, CEWE achieves the highest earnings figure in the company's history\n- CEWE successfully converts a heightened level of holiday travel in 2023 – leading consumers to take a lot of new photos – into its own business growth\n- The Commercial Online Printing and Retail business units clearly improve and also make a positive contribution to Group EBIT\n\nImage /page/14/Figure/16 description: The image is a stacked bar chart showing the growth of different types of photofinishing from 1990 to 2022.

In late December 2023, CEWE sold futalis – which had previously been reported in the \"Other Activities\" business unit – as announced. Including futalis, the operating earnings (EBIT) of the CEWE Group thus calculated increased to 81.6 million euros in 2023 (2022: 75.6 million euros). For 2023, CEWE had envisaged an EBIT figure of between 70 and 82 million euros.\n\n**83.9**\n\nmillion euros EBIT in 2023\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/10 description: The image shows the word \"cewe\" in white, handwritten-style font against a red rectangular background.

In 2023, the usual seasonal nature of business once again loomed large in terms of consumers' placement of orders: the first quarter picks up, the second and third quarters are somewhat flat or even register a slight decline, while the fourth quarter with the key Christmas business season is then generally stronger. The simple explanation for this is that in the spring and the summer, when the weather is nice, people spend a lot of time traveling and attending parties and events – this time of the year offers a good deal of opportunities to take a lot of new photos. During the six months of the year when the weather is less good, many people then spend more time at home and place orders for photo products – and naturally do so particularly often when it comes to choosing gifts for Christmas. In the past financial year 2023, a CEWE PHOTOBOOK, a photo calendar, wall art and many other personal photo gifts once again served as permanent mementos of a wide range of experiences.\n\n#### **Further growth in volume of photos and CEWE PHOTOBOOK sales**\n\nPhoto products especially have a very high emotional value for many people and demand for them is increasing, largely independently of the overall economic trend. In the past financial year, due to factors including the strong positioning of its brands and its marketing activities CEWE has thus above all successfully converted the resurgence\n\nof holiday travel in 2023 – which led consumers to take a large number of new photos – into its own business growth: the total number of photos across the entire CEWE product range increased by + 4.8 % in the year under review to 2.39 billion photos (2022: 2.28 billion photos). It thus reached a level at the upper end of the target range envisaged for 2023 of between 2.2 and 2.3 billion photos, or even slightly exceeded this. CEWE PHOTOBOOK also developed positively, with growth of 3.4 % to a sales volume of 6.1 million CEWE PHOTOBOOKS (2022: 5.8 million PHOTO-BOOKS) and also exceeded its target for 2023 of up to 6.0 million PHOTOBOOKS. CEWE has thus produced over 86 million CEWE PHOTOBOOKS for its customers since 2005: CEWE PHOTOBOOK remains Europe's most popular photo book.\n\n#### **Photofinishing turnover rises by 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros**\n\nIn Photofinishing, 2023 started out with a very strong Q1 and turnover growth of + 12.0 %. This was followed by Q2 and Q3, with turnover increases of + 9.0 % and + 7.1 % respectively, while the fourth quarter achieved further growth of + 4.1 %, relative to the high level in the previous year. In overall terms, in the year 2023 as a whole Photofinishing turnover thus increased by a strong + 6.9 % to 658.8 million euros: growth of 42.7 million euros (Photofinishing turnover 2022: 616.1 million euros). On the one hand, customers have increased their orders of photo products. On the other hand, the price increases implemented for almost all product groups are supporting this turnover growth. These price increases were necessary in order to compensate for inflation-driven higher costs affecting virtually all of the P&L items, such as the cost of sales, personnel expenses and other operating expenses (including logistics and energy costs).\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/14 description: The image shows a blue outline of a camera icon.

As in every year, in 2023 CEWE once again realised most of its annual profits in the fourth calendar quarter. Thanks to strong economies of scale in CEWE's production operations, which operated at full capacity during the Christmas business season, this high earnings share in the fourth quarter is entirely typical. With a weaker level of capacity utilisation and due to the high residual fixed costs, Q1, Q2 and Q3 generally only provide a lower share of earnings.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 also gained ground, considered in isolation: following an EBIT figure of 74.6 million euros in Q4 in the previous year, in the quarter under review EBIT improved by 3.6 million euros to 78.2 million euros.\n\n> The Christmas business season once again gathers steam, providing Photofinishing with a strong result for the year: EBIT of 80.0 million euros in 2023.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, one-off factors accounted for a total of approx. – 4.0 million euros due to amortisation on the purchase price allocations for Cheerz (– 0.9 million euros), WhiteWall (– 2.1 million euros) and Hertz (0.5 million euros) as well as a writedown on software licences no longer required (– 0.5 million euros). In the previous year, 2022, a combined figure of – 4.2 million euros was recognised as extraordinary expenses, for amortisation on purchase price allocations (Cheerz – 1.7 million euros, WhiteWall – 2.1 million euros and Hertz – 0.4 million euros). Adjusted for these one-off factors, the operating EBIT figure for the Photofinishing business unit reached a level of 84.0 million euros in the financial year 2023 (adjusted operating EBIT in 2022: 77.9 million euros).\n\n#### **Photofinishing's operating EBIT margin registers further slight increase and reaches a strong 12.8 %**\n\nIn 2023, the operating earnings margin (before the extraordinary expenses described above) in the Photofinishing core business unit maintains the trend of a continuous long-term increase in profitability: following\n\n# **12.8 %**\n\noperating EBIT margin for Photofinishing in 2023\n\n12.7 % in 2022, Photofinishing's EBIT margin amounted to 12.8 % and thus once again increased slightly. Over the past few years, the ongoing change in the product mix and the additional contribution margins arising from the longterm increase in turnover have resulted in a steady rise in the operating EBIT margin in the Photofinishing business unit. The year 2020 provided particularly impressive proof of the sort of margin which is possible with corresponding volume growth: the strong, coronavirus-shaped increase in demand caused CEWE's operating EBIT margin to temporarily jump to an extraordinarily high 15.1 %.\n\n> Following 12.7 % in 2022, in 2023 Photofinishing's EBIT margin was once again at a strong level and registered a further slight increase to 12.8 %.\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/18 description: This bar chart shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2019, the value is 66.9 with a +15.7% change. In 2020, the value is 88.6 with a +32.4% change. In 2021, the value is 71.2 with a -19.7% change. In 2022, the value is 73.7 with a +3.5% change.

Combined Management Report\n\nent Report 4 Remuneration\n\n# Retail business unit\n\nCEWE operates multichannel retailing in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Norway and Sweden in the form of retail outlets and online shops. CEWE RETAIL clearly focuses on generating photofinishing business, i.e. the marketing of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS, calendars, greeting cards, wall art and other photo gifts. The turnover and earnings contribution provided by this photofinishing product range is reported in the Photofinishing business unit. The Retail business unit only reports turnover and earnings from photo hardware business generated e.g. with cameras and photo accessories. In future, CEWE will continue to develop this merchandise business with optimal margins, while deliberately avoiding unprofitable turnover.\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n**Retail turnover** in millions of euros /  change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar chart that shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The value for 2023 is 31.1 with a -3.4% change.\n\n#### **Retail realises turnover volume of 31.3 million euros in 2023**\n\nWith its 100 or so branches in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern Europe, hardware retail achieved an annual turnover volume of 31.3 million euros in 2023 (2022: 32.4 million euros; – 3.4 %). Adjusted for currency effects, this turnover even increased slightly by 1.4 %. For Retail, too, the fourth quarter with the Christmas business season and a turnover share in excess of 30 % is the most important quarter of the year: following 10.2 million euros of Q4 turnover last year, in the quarter under review which has now ended CEWE Retail achieved a turnover volume of 9.5 million euros (–7.1%). Adjusted for currency effects, hardware retail achieved a Q4 turnover volume which was 3.0 % weaker.\n\nIn its Retail business unit, CEWE is continuing to focus on its business with photofinishing products (which is reported in its Photofinishing business unit) and uses its retail activities as a B2C sales channel for CEWE PHOTO-BOOK, photo calendars, wall art and many other photo products.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/13 description: The image contains a block of text that reads: \"Through its deliberate abandonment of low-margin photo hardware business and its focus on photo-finishing products, CEWER has been actively reducing its photo hardware turnover for some years now.\"\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/14 description: The image shows a blue icon of two people, a man and a woman.

The y-axis shows the Retail EBIT in millions of euros. In 2019, the Retail EBIT was 0.0. In 2020, the Retail EBIT was -4.2, a change of -36.4%. In 2021, the Retail EBIT was 0.2. In 2022, the Retail EBIT was 0.2. In 2023, the Retail EBIT was 0.5, a change of +179%. Next to the bar chart is a text box that says \"Retail remains well positioned in 2023: despite the slight decrease in turnover, its EBIT figure improves by a significant 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros.\"\n\nIn the photo hardware segment (cameras and accessories), CEWE is continuing to deliberately make do without low-margin retail business. In previous years, the active reduction in turnover in the Retail business unit was normally around – 10 %.\n\n#### **Hardware retail improves EBIT figure despite slight decline in turnover**\n\nThe earnings trend reflects Retail's strong position: despite the slight fall in turnover, in 2023 the Retail business unit strongly improved its contribution to Group EBIT, by 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros (2022: 0.2 million euros). In view of typically relatively low merchandise margins, this is a top-rate performance. In the first year of the pandemic, 2020, CEWE had already resolved to close overall slightly more than 40 branches in all of the countries where CEWE's Retail business unit operates. CEWE Retail continued to benefit from this accelerated optimisation of its branch structure in the financial year 2023 now ended.\n\nIn the Retail business unit too, Christmas business – and thus the fourth quarter – plays a key role in the earnings trend for the year as a whole. With a Q4 EBIT figure of 0.9 million euros which was achieved above all in December, during the Christmas business season, the earnings shortfall up to the end of the third quarter was once again fully made up for in the past year, and Retail made a positive contribution to Group earnings (EBIT Q4 2022: 0.7 million euros).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\ns 3 Combined Management Report\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n- With its \"best-price guarantee\" for its customers, Commercial Online Printing increases its turnover by + 6.6 % to 92.2 million euros (2022: 86.5 million euros)\n- Optimised cost structure provides further sustained improvement in income situation, COP increases its EBIT to 4.2 million euros (2022: 2.3 million euros) and achieves an EBIT margin of 4.5 %\n\n**+ 6.6 %**\n\nturnover growth in Commercial Online Printing in 2023\n\nchange on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/12 description: The image shows a pattern of blue dots on a light gray background.

The overall effect is a dynamic and abstract design.\n\n# Commercial Online Printing business unit\n\nWith its online printing brands SAXOPRINT, viaprinto and LASERLINE, CEWE is ideally positioned on the European market for printed advertising media and business stationery ordered online and has a particularly strong presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (the \"DACH\" region): SAXOPRINT serves customers primarily in the offset printing segment, in Germany and in the Group's other international markets, and offers a best-price guarantee; viaprinto is primarily positioned in the digital printing segment as a provider of high-quality printed products with small print runs; LASERLINE has a particularly strong presence in Berlin and Brandenburg and serves customers based in this region.\n\n**Commercial Online Printing achieves further growth in 2023**\n\nIn the year under review 2023 now ended, with its \"bestprice guarantee\" for its customers Commercial Online Printing once again achieved an increase in turnover: at\n\n**Commercial Online Printing turnover** in millions of euros /  change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/18 description: The image is a bar chart that shows values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The turnover contribution provided by the fourth quarter amounted to 25.9 million euros (turnover in Q4 2022: 26.5 million euros). This \"best-price guarantee\" stands for the promise that SAXOPRINT's printing products will always be offered at the lowest price on the market. Should a SAXOPRINT customer find that a similar product is available from competitors at a lower price, SAXOPRINT will reimburse the price difference. This best-price guarantee is made possible by the level of cost efficiency achieved in SAXOPRINT's production operations: SAXOPRINT's highly automated production plant is considered one of the most modern technology parks for online offset printing in Europe. In order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. **Retail EBIT** in millions of euros / **Commercial Online Printing EBIT** in millions of euros / \n\n> With the \"best-price guarantee\" which it offers its customers, Commercial Online Printing achieves further growth in the    financial year 2023: + 6.6 % increase in turnover.\n\nchange on previous year as %\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n2 Combined Management Report\n\nent Report 4. Remuneration\n\ntion\n\n#### **COP earnings significantly increased to 4.2 million euros**\n\nWhile it is still some way off its pre-pandemic turnover volume seen in 2019 (103.2 million euros), Commercial Online Printing has improved its EBIT contribution to Group earnings by 1.9 million euros to 4.2 million euros and has thus once again achieved a strong improvement by comparison with the level which it realised in the previous year (COP EBIT 2022: 2.3 million euros). With an optimised cost structure, the Commercial Online Printing business unit has thus once again achieved its breakeven target, which it has successfully lowered: thanks to the level of cost efficiency achieved in production operations and the \"bestprice guarantee\" for its customers which this enables, the COP business unit continues to post profitable growth. In the fourth quarter of 2023 considered in isolation, COP realised an EBIT figure of 2.7 million euros, which represented an 18.3 % improvement on the same quarter in the previous year (COP EBIT for Q4 2022: 2.3 million euros).\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/9 description: The image shows the logo for \"viaprinto\".

In particular, the costs associated with the company's supervisory bodies, its general meeting and its investor relations activities are structural and company costs which are incurred for all of the company's business units. Moreover, the earnings generated by the Group company futalis were previously reported in this business unit, since the business activities of futalis, as a producer of pet food, could not be allocated to CEWE's other business units. In the past financial year, CEWE sold futalis in late December 2023 and thus removed futalis from its Group profit and loss account in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nIncluding futalis, in the financial year 2023 CEWE realised revenues in the amount of 8.6 million euros (2022: 8.3 million euros) in its Other Activities business unit, all of which are attributable to futalis. If futalis is included in the EBIT calculation, as it has been previously, then in the past financial year the Other Activities business unit registered a loss of – 3.1 million euros (2022: – 0.6 million euros). Of this amount, – 2.3 million euros related to futalis. This consists of a – 1.0 million euros operating loss, a – 0.8 million euros writedown on a production plant and a – 0.5 million euros deconsolidation loss.\n\nIf futalis is excluded, no revenues were realised in the Other Activities business unit in 2023 (2022: 0.0 million euros). The contribution to this business unit's Group EBIT, thus calculated, amounted to – 0.8 million euros (2022: – 0.6 million euros).\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/10 description: The image shows a wavy pattern of dots that transition in color from purple to blue.

This figure does not include the turnover of futalis which was sold in December 2023, since IFRS 5 requires its removal from the individual P&L items as a \"discontinued operation or operation disposed of\" (see also the comments in the \"Other Activities business unit\" section). Group turnover including the revenues provided by futalis increased by + 6.5 % or 47.8 million euros to 788.8 million euros (2022: 741.0 million euros). With both of these figures, CEWE has exceeded its envisaged turnover target range for 2023 of between 720 and 780 million euros.\n\n#### **Group EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros**\n\nThe CEWE Group's reported EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros in 2023 and thus reaches a new peak (EBIT in 2022: 75.6 million euros). The EBIT figure calculated including futalis' earnings rises to 81.6 million euros and is thus at the upper end of the EBIT target for 2023 (which is based on the same logic) of between 70 and 82 million euros. CEWE was able to compensate for the cost increases which affected all of its P&L items (and were mainly inflationdriven) by raising its own prices. Photofinishing, Retail and Commercial Online Printing have all contributed to this improvement in earnings. This is a very nice trend in all three of CEWE's business units in 2023.\n\n> With growth in its Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units, CEWE's turnover increased by 47.5 million euros or 6.5 % in 2023. This is once again an impressive trend.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/12 description: The image shows a blue line graph. The line starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, then dips down slightly before rising again to the top right.\n\n- Reported Group turnover increases by 47.5 million euros in 2023 to 780.2 million euros (2022: 732.7 million euros): a growth rate of 6.5 %\n- Reported Group EBIT increases to 83.9 million euros (2022: 75.6 million euros)\n- Group turnover incl. futalis which was sold in December 2023 increases by + 6.5 % or 47.8 million euros to 788.8 million euros (2022: 741.0 million euros). The CEWE Group's EBIT, thus calculated, rises to 81.6 million euros (2022: 75.6 million euros)\n- All goals for 2023 thus achieved at the upper end of the planned ranges or even exceeded\n- Tax rate at expected normal level of 32.2 %\n- Earnings per share increase to 8.10 euros (2022: 7.20 euros)\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/19 description: The image shows a background with a pattern of blue dots that appear to be arranged in a wave-like formation.

In 2020, the total is 728.5 with a +11.5% change, broken down into 67.8 for photofinishing, 34.1 for retail, and 620.0 for other activities. In 2021, the total is 694.9 with a -3.5% change, broken down into 66.0 for photofinishing, 31.2 for retail, and 590.1 for other activities.

In general, CEWE is continuing to benefit strongly from the company's early transformation resulting in its adoption of an online business model: growth is being driven by the trend of smartphone-based photography as well as photo products which can be ordered conveniently online or via smartphone apps. Together with its strong business partners which, with more than 20,000 retail stores in Europe, provide an additional guarantee of customer-oriented service, with its innovations CEWE is continuously driving the evolution of the photography market. The past year once again demonstrated that photo products in particular have\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n> a very high emotional value for many people – especially as a Christmas present – and that demand for them is on the rise, largely independently of the overall economic trend.\n\n#### **Inflation-influenced changes in P&L items strongly reflect business trend**\n\nThe contributions which the various business units provide to the profit and loss account varies in structural terms: in the Photofinishing business unit, the trend towards valueadded products generally means a lower volume of material expenditure but an increasing volume of personnel expenses and other operating expenses. Commercial Online Printing is generally characterised by a higher cost of materials and slightly lower personnel expenses and other operating expenses than in the Photofinishing business unit. On the other hand, Retail entails a significantly higher cost of materials but lower personnel expenses and other operating expenses than in the other two business units.\n\n**83.9**\n\nmillion euros EBIT in 2023 – a new high\n\nOn average, the CEWE Group had 3,903 employees in 2023 (2022: 3,816). Of this number, 2,615 employees or approx. 67.0 % (2022: 2,537 employees or 66.5 %) worked at the CEWE Group's German plants and 1,288 employees or 33.0 % (2022: 1,279 employees or 33.5 %) at the CEWE Group's foreign plants.\n\nThis slight change year-on-year is partially attributable to new hirings for central functions in Oldenburg, at White-Wall and, in Commercial Online Printing, at our Dresden production plant. Moreover, for the purpose of calculating\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/15 description: The image contains two charts and some text.

This trend reflects the 29.3 million euros increase in current assets in particular. This is attributable, above all, to the 44.3 million euros growth in liquidity and, on the other hand, the decrease in current receivables from income tax refunds on the basis of a tax assessment. In the previous year, high tax prepayments had been reported here on account of the coronavirus-related upswing. In addition, a lower figure has been reported for current trade receivables, since payments from business partners were delayed in the previous year and thus only settled in the past financial year.\n\nNon-current assets have increased by 4.0 million euros to 380.1 million euros. Above all, this is attributable to property, plant and equipment investments in new and modernised production space in the Photofinishing business unit. The amortisation-related decrease in intangible assets and the declining fair value measurement of financial investments, due to profits distributed by a VC fund investment, had the opposite effect.\n\n#### **CEWE has strong equity ratio of 58.4 % (previous year: 57.3 %)**\n\nEquity has increased by a total of 26.5 million euros by comparison with December 31, 2023 and amounts to 389.2 million euros. This mainly reflects positive comprehensive income for the past four quarters in the amount of 51.5 million euros. Following what was already a very solid level in the previous year (December 31, 2022: 57.3 %), the equity ratio has once again increased, to 58.4 %.\n\nThe Group's debt (the total of current and non-current liabilities) has risen by 6.8 million euros from 269.9 million euros to 276.7 million euros. This growth is attributable to the 6.2 million euros increase in current liabilities to 202.4 million euros, specifically the personnel liabilities included in this item as well as the earnings-related increase in tax accruals. Non-current liabilities have changed only slightly, with an increase of 0.6 million euros to 74.3 million euros. The growth in pension accruals which this item mainly consists of contrasts with a decrease in non-current lease liabilities due to the expiry of the time limits in question.\n\nThe management balance sheet shows total assets of 666.0 million euros reduced by current, non-interestbearing operating liabilities in the total amount of 192.9 million euros, as well as the debt and equity elements subject to interest and dividends totalling 473.1 million euros.\n\n#### **Capital employed rises by 26.7 million euros, mainly due to the turnover-related increase in trade receivables and investment-related fixed assets growth**\n\nThe volume of capital employed has risen by 26.7 million euros year-on-year, due to an increase in both cash and cash equivalents (+ 44.3 million euros) and non-current assets (+ 4.0 million euros). Liquidity thus reflects the strength of operating cash flow. On the other hand, net working capital has increased (– 21.6 million euros). Non-operating liabilities mainly relate to pension accruals and increase by 4.2 million euros due to a reduced accounting interest rate.\n\n#### **Solid equity causes the volume of capital invested to increase by 26.7 million euros**\n\nThe 26.7 million euros rise in the volume of capital invested is attributable to the 26.5 million euros increase in equity. In equity, the comprehensive income item of 51.5 million euros reflects CEWE's earnings strength, which more than compensates for the dividend payment and the other changes in equity. Gross financial liabilities decrease by 3.9 million euros due to the decline in lease liabilities. Non-operating liabilities mainly relate to pension accruals and increase by 4.2 million euros due to a reduced accounting interest rate.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nKey changes to balance sheet items\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/7 description: This image shows the balance sheet on Dec. 31, 2023 in millions of euros.

Following the increase in the previous year, they contributed 10.8 million euros less to operating cash flow. Taking a slight increase in inventories into consideration, net operating working capital absorbed 14.4 million euros less cash in the past financial year. Other net working capital also absorbed 2.8 million euros less cash than in the previous year. Tax payments likewise decreased, falling by 10.9 million euros.\n\n#### **Due to a reduced volume of company acquisitions as well as offsetting financial income, net cash used in investing activities decreases to – 47.9 million euros**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities declines to – 47.9 million euros, above all due to the absence of payments for the purchase of shares in companies, increased inflows from financial assets and payments for operational investments which are slightly lower than in the previous year.\n\n- Operating cash flow increases by 37.4 million euros to 130.8 million euros and thus exceeds pre-coronavirus level\n- Operating cash flow in particular results in 51.4 million euros increase in free cash flow\n- Normalised free cash flow of 69.7 million euros is 8.3 million euros higher than the normalised previous year's level of 61.4 million euros\n\n**130.8**\n\nmillion euros cash flow from operating activities\n\n#### **Cash flow from operating activities**\n\nin millions of euros / change on previous year as %\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/21 description: The image is a bar graph comparing values from 2019 to 2023.

The first chart, titled \"Free cash flow in millions of euros / change on previous year as %,\" shows the following data: 2019: 35.5 (+>1.000%), 2020: 103.3 (+191%), 2021: 21.5 (-79.2%), 2022: 31.5 (+46.6%), and 2023: 82.8 (+51.4, +163%). A note states, \"Free cash flow rises by 51.4 million euros in 2023 to 82.8 million euros.\" Additional information includes: \"Cash outflows from company acquisitions (+7.7 million euros): no company acquisitions in financial year,\" \"Inflows from investments in financial assets (+4.4 million euros),\" and \"Cash outflows for operational investments (+2.4 million euros).\" The second chart, titled \"Net cash used in investing activities in millions of euros / change on previous year as %,\" presents the following data: 2019: -67.2 (+11.9%), 2020: -39.0 (+41.9%), 2021: -44.1 (-13.1%), 2022: -40.2 (-61.9), and 2023: -47.9 (+14.0, +22.6%).\n\n#### **Operating cash flow in particular results in 51.4 million euros increase in free cash flow**\n\nOverall, free cash flow increased by 51.4 million euros to 82.8 million euros. This resulted from the 37.4 million euros increase in cash flow from operating activities to 130.8 million euros as well as a decrease in net cash used in investing activities to 47.9 million euros.\n\n#### **Normalised free cash flow of 69.7 million euros is 8.3 million euros higher than the normalised previous year's level of 63.7 million euros**\n\nThe financial year 2022 was shaped by the fact that – as outlined above – some business partners only settled in the financial year 2023 liabilities with a volume of approx. 9.0 million euros which were attributable to the financial\n\nyear 2022. In addition, tax payments of 3.9 million euros exceeded the tax expense for the year 2022. Within the net cash used in investing activities, the purchase price payment for Hertz and the acquisition of an administrative site at CEWE's Oldenburg location generated an additional funding requirement of 17.0 million euros. In overall terms, the free cash flow in 2022 was thus reduced by 29.9 million euros. In the financial year 2023, operating cash flow decreased by 11.5 million euros due to tax payments which were lower than the volume of tax expense in 2023, on account of the reimbursement of tax prepayments. Moreover, an additional approx. 9.0 million euros in liabilities to business partners from the financial year 2022 had been repaid in the first quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operating activities was thus increased by 20.5 million euros. Within the net cash used in investing\n\nactivities, cash outflows due to capacity-boosting new buildings and significant expansions of production plants resulted in an additional funding requirement of 12.8 million euros. In addition, CEWE received profits distributed from financial investments in the amount of 5.4 million euros. Overall, free cash flow in 2023 accordingly increased by 13.1 million euros.\n\n**Net cash used in investing activities** in millions of euros / \n\nchange on previous year as %\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Free cash flow** in millions of euros / change on previous year as %\n\n3 Combined Management Report\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>32</sup>\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n#### **Normalised cash flow 2022 vs. 2023** in millions of euros\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/7 description: This image contains two charts. The first chart is a waterfall chart showing cash flow from operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and free cash flow for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, cash flow from operating activities is 106.3, net cash used in investing activities is -44.9, and free cash flow is 61.4. For 2023, free cash flow is 82.8, net cash used in investing activities is -40.5, and cash flow from operating activities is 130.8. The second chart is a table showing the normalisation account for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, advance debt collection by business partners is 9, tax payments exceeding tax expense is 3.9, normalisation of cash flow from operating activities is 12.9, acquisition of Hertz is 7.7, special investments in real estate (purchase/construction) is 9.3, distribution of profits from financial investments is not listed, and normalisation of net cash used in investing activities is 17, and normalisation of free cash flow is 29.9. For 2023, advance debt collection by business partners is -9, tax payments exceeding tax expense is -11.5, normalisation of cash flow from operating activities is -20.5, acquisition of Hertz is not listed, special investments in real estate (purchase/construction) is 12.8, distribution of profits from financial investments is -5.4, normalisation of net cash used in investing activities is 7.4, and normalisation of free cash flow is -13.1.\n\nWithout these effects, free cash flow in 2022 would have amounted to 61.4 million euros and that of the current financial year to 69.7 million euros, which clearly exceeds the previous year's figure.\n\n#### **Operating cash flow in particular results in 25.6 million euros increase in free cash flow in the fourth quarter**\n\nFree cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 increases by 25.6 million euros to 92.7 million euros. Compared to the same quarter in the previous year, cash flow from operating activities accounted for 22.1 million euros of this increase. The total of EBITDA and non-cash effects increases by 5.3 million euros. Net working capital flow decreases by comparison with the fourth quarter in the previous year (15.7 million euros) and thus strengthens cash flow from operating activities. This decline has resulted from the payments from business partners which in 2023 once again occurred in the fourth quarter, together with an increase in trade payables. At the same time, the company paid 1.1 million euros less in taxes. Another factor impacting the free cash flow is the net cash used in investing activities, which increased by 3.5 million euros, mainly on account of the profits distributed from financial investments.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\ne 2.

The turnover trend for the core Photofinishing business unit will improve slightly, on average. The Retail business unit is expected to once again register a slight decline in turnover generated by photo hardware, while Commercial Online Printing will likely achieve further slight turnover growth in most markets.\n\n→ Review of 2023 and outlook for 2024\n\n#### **EBIT earnings target range in 2024: 77 to 87 million euros**\n\nIn 2024, Group EBIT will fall within a range of between 77 million euros and 87 million euros, the EBT figure will amount to between 75.5 million euros and 85.5 million euros, while earnings after tax will lie within a range of 51 million euros to 58 million euros.\n\n#### **Operational investments planned at normal level**\n\nThe operational investments planned for 2023 (i.e. outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) are expected to be around 65 million euros.\n\n#### **Goal is for continuous further dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE considers itself an extremely reliable dividend payer. The dividend proposed for 2023 would represent a 15th consecutive increase. In general, CEWE pursues the goal of dividend continuity. Where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities, this means a dividend which is\n\n# **77 – 87**\n\nmillion euros EBIT figure planned for 2024\n\nat least unchanged in absolute terms, and ideally an increased dividend. This policy clearly focuses on the absolute dividend value, with the payout ratio or the dividend yield as a secondary element.\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/18 description: The image is a bar graph titled \"Long term revenue\" with the x-axis representing years from 1992 to 2024 and the y-axis representing revenue.

On the one hand, general cost increases affecting consumers might impact their spending or lead to them to travel less and thus influence the number of photos they take and the volume of orders they place. On the other hand, continuing inflation at CEWE might result in a further increase in costs and the cost of sales. That would necessitate compensatory price increases, which might negatively affect consumer demand. To take account of these external conditions and reflect their potential effects on CEWE's business development in its planning, CEWE has also defined ranges for all of its relevant target figures for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe ranges for these targets for 2024 represent approximate figures and reflect the current uncertainties. In its operational planning for 2024, the Board of Management naturally aims to achieve a target in the upper half of this envisaged range.\n\n#### **Targets for 2024 CEWE Group**\n\n|                             |                   | 2024         | Change<br>as % |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Photos                      | billion units     | 2,3 to 2,4   | -2 to +2       |\n| CEWE PHOTOBOOK              | million units     | 5,9 to 6,2   | -2 to +2       |\n| Operational investments1    | Mio.

Where is the red we're so used to?**\n\n**YR:** The red is still there – in CEWE's umbrella brand. But we decided to take the important step of giving the CEWE business group – with its many strong brands – a new platform. Both visually, as you can see, but also from the point of view of content. With combined goals, priorities and principles. The intention is for all our brands to shine here with equal prominence. After all, we are a group and together we are more than the sum of our individual parts.\n\n#### **That sounds like you have already gained a very detailed overview of this wide-ranging group and have settled in very nicely at CEWE.**\n\n**YR:** Yes, definitely! I joined CEWE a year ago.\n\n#### **Time flies.**\n\n**YR:** Undoubtedly so – particularly at CEWE. But I have a couple of comments in response to your question.\n\n#### **We're all ears!**\n\n**YR:** First of all, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for the very warm welcome I have received. That applies to the other members of the Board of Management, but I was welcomed with open arms everywhere else, too. Whether in Oldenburg, Koźle, Mönchengladbach, Cologne, Paris or Germering – CEWE has a remarkable team spirit which I have noticed everywhere. It has been a great experience, which has brought home to me CEWE's immense strength: its outstanding spirit of togetherness which we call \"The WE in CEWE\". We can count on one another. In a company where so many processes are so tightly intertwined, effective collaboration is key.\n\n#### **And your second comment?**\n\n**YR:** That our business is a unique and complex one – after all, we produce on-demand. We are very strong in terms of our depth of added value, which enables us to offer a highly integrated photofinishing solution – with a growing level of customer satisfaction. Within the company, that\n\nrequires a deep understanding of many different ramifications and details. It takes some time to understand that and to handle things accordingly. That brings us back to the topic of collaboration. Not only do our members of staff grasp these details – they also work together to outstanding effect, thus continuously improving the service which CEWE offers our customers. An important lesson I learned during my first year was CEWE's unique ability to produce this unbelievably high level of quality. Particularly at crunch time – our Christmas quarter, which spans the entire fourth quarter – it is crucial that everything functions smoothly. We operate a three-shift production system, our marketing activities are in full swing, and our customer service assists customers around the clock. Every year, we demonstrate again and again our mastery of all this.\n\ncewe group\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nt Report 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n#### **I get that. You referred to a complex business – was your sale of futalis a step you took to reduce CEWE's complexity?**\n\n→ Interview\n\n**YR:** futalis, a young company focusing on customised dog food, has experienced various phases in its development. To start off with, it received support from High-Tech-Gründerfonds (HTGF), a seed investor initiated by the German government which assisted futalis with its start-up expertise.\n\nFollowing this phase, industrialisation of futalis' highly specific customised production process was required. That task was a perfect fit for CEWE since we are experts in the highly automated production of individual items, as we have demonstrated in our Photofinishing business unit for decades. We therefore stepped up our commitment here and increased our shareholding. We used our expertise to help futalis with the development and realisation of a machine which automates the mixing process for customised dog food. With this technology, futalis reached an important milestone: in principle, its business is now profitably scalable.\n\n#### **That sounds very promising. So why did you sell futalis?**\n\n**YR:** Well, at that point there was a need for market expertise above all – both in the purchasing market for dog food ingredients and in the sales market. None of that is a core area of expertise of CEWE. But the situation is different for futalis – it has that expertise, or is continuously developing it. While futalis' turnover volume was less than 10 million euros, it nonetheless required attention. For\n\nthese reasons, we had already initiated a sales process in 2019/2020, but this was then hampered by the pandemic. So we had another go once the pandemic was over, and this was brought to a successful close in late 2023. The effects can be seen in CEWE's annual financial statements. We would like to wish the futalis team all the best for the company's continued development.\n\n#### **At any rate, you have thus removed a loss-maker from CEWE's profit and loss account!**\n\n**YR:** That is not the right way to interpret things. Last year futalis grew by more than 4 % despite the fact that many people cut back on their spending on pets in the postpandemic period. The loss which was removed from CEWE's profit and loss account in 2023 is mainly attributable to one-off deconsolidation effects. Over the past few years, futalis has carved out a respectable market position for itself which it can now build upon.\n\n**Ms Rostock, for 2023 you have achieved an earnings volume excluding futalis which exceeds your EBIT target range of between 70 and 82 million euros. That is an impressive start as CEO. Other new CEOs often recognise all manner of possible valuation adjustments in their first year ... and then claim that is due to their predecessors. Why haven't you done that?**\n\n**YR:** It's not my style to play games with earnings figures. I always aim to do my best and promote the long-term development of a business – I am not concerned with short-term effects. That is reflected in the corporate culture at CEWE and its preference for a long-term perspective – at CEWE, we think in terms of decades. We\n\nencourage solid and profitable development. A key goal was to bring 2023 to a close with very strong results, despite the difficult economic environment. We achieved that, and we spent the entire year preparing for it. Finally, in the fourth quarter everything came together and we had an outstanding business season, once again proving that \"we can do Christmas\".\n\n#### **Where do you intend to break new ground? What do you wish to change?**\n\n**YR:** I aim to strengthen strengths and leverage potential. As the CEWE Group, we are supported by various brands such as CEWE, Cheerz, Pixum and Saxoprint which are prospering individually and contributing to an outstanding overall result. We will continue to invest in these brands, with our know-how, exciting innovations and our key resource – our people whose work brings such joy to our customers. We are pursuing a clear strategy which is focused on healthy growth. Our guiding principle \"WE in CEWE\" defines the role of leadership and team spirit at our company: on an equal footing with one another, acting transparently and showing appreciation for one another. We live and work according to these principles at CEWE. We support one another and we are there for one another. With this internalised philosophy, we are continuously seeking to optimise things and achieve progress, while aiming to operate as efficiently as possible. We are driven by a spirit of innovation – this idea has deep roots in CEWE's DNA and has already carried the company through processes of transformation in the past. It is not for nothing that CEWE refers to 4,000 innovators in its Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units. We are\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1 CEWE at a Glance\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n**Financial Statements** 6 F\n\nlikewise always state-of-the-art in our current transformation processes: as I said before, at CEWE innovations are shaped by our entire workforce. That is equally true of the issues we are dealing with in relation to artificial intelligence. For instance, we are providing our employees with easy access to AI via our CEWE GPT initiative. At the same time, teams of experts such as our Mobile & Artificial Intelligence Campus (MAIC) are researching the development of new base technologies. We are already using AI – for instance, to improve the quality of photos sent by WhatsApp. AI shows great promise throughout our value chain and for our various stakeholders. We aim to use it responsibly. If we integrate AI the right way, we can use it as a partner which helps us and relieves us of the need to perform routine tasks – for consumers as co-creators, for our employees as co-workers, and for us as a business as a co-pilot.\n\n→ Interview\n\n#### **Exciting times lie ahead of us. Is there a guiding principle which you stand for, if you were forced to choose one?**\n\n**YR:** That brings me to the topic of customer centricity. That is probably the aspect of my career which has shaped me the most, coming from the beauty and consumer goods\n\nindustries. It provides you with different, additional perspectives, and I would like to continue to contribute these. We're adjusting things here and there but, as I have said, the CEWE system is running to outstanding effect, as the results for the past year demonstrate. Operating as a team, all of us at CEWE ensure that our photo products are a source of joy. That only works in concert with our customers, whose creativity and individuality turn our offerings into cherished products which carry great emotional significance and are full of personal stories, memories and experiences. We thus create products whose value far exceeds their price. We aim to trigger this feeling with every order. That is exactly why we are strongly focusing on indicators such as the NPS (Net Promoter Score), one of our key internal KPIs. If our customers are satisfied, that will generally also be reflected in our business figures.\n\n#### **Definitely, our figures speak for themselves!**\n\n**YR:** Very much so. 2023 was a year of new record figures at CEWE. With a turnover volume of 780.2 million euros, an EBIT of 83.9 million euros, an adjusted (and by adjusted I mean \"understated\") free cash flow of 69.7 million euros, a ROCE of 18.8 % and an equity ratio of 58.4 %, we either reached new highs or were very close to them. Our entire team has done outstanding groundwork here – I am all the more delighted to be part of all this.\n\n**One more question, since you are also in charge of distribution: the strong results you just mentioned are partly based on price increases which you implemented in 2023. Some companies have faced media accusations of \"greedflation\" for imposing price increases in their sales activities which are considerably higher than those justified for their purchasing operations. How are things at CEWE?**\n\n**YR:** As in 2022, we once again proceeded very cautiously in 2023. Our goal was to at least bring in as an absolute amount on the turnover side the cost increases which we had incurred due to inflation. In view of our rising volume of turnover – which was at least partly due to inflation – this would have reduced our percentage margin. We were therefore obliged to implement additional countermeasures, through efficiency gains in order to stabilise or increase our margin. For instance, if you look at what is probably the most meaningful operating margin in our Photofinishing business unit, we kept this at 12.7 % in 2022 and even increased it slightly to 12.8 % in 2023. CEWE has taken a very moderate course here: we have done what was necessary, but no more.\n\n#### **Ms Rostock, many thanks for the interview! We have the sense that you really have settled in well at CEWE.**\n\n**YR:** Thank you so much for your kind words. I am delighted to be here.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>\n\n🔍 < 39 >\n\n# CEWE share\n\n#### **Cash-rich blue chips and technology equities drive the stock markets in 2023**\n\n→ CEWE share\n\nThe trend on the financial markets was shaped by a wide range of factors in 2023: the ongoing high level of inflation, the interest-rate hikes implemented by leading central banks, the suspension of the USA's debt ceiling, the turbulence in the banking sector, the continuing war in Ukraine and the flare-up of the Israel conflict all generated a great deal of pressure and uncertainty. Having said that, the financial markets performed surprisingly strongly in some cases. However, despite frequently positive price performance many German stocks experienced a significant outflow of liquidity by comparison with previous years: many investors increasingly allocated their funds\n\n#### **Key share information**\n\n| Type of security            | No-par value share               |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Market segment              | Regulated market, PRIME STANDARD |\n| Index                       | SDAX (from March 23, 2009)       |\n| ISIN                        | DE 0005403901                    |\n| Symbol                      | CWC                              |\n| Reuters                     | CWCG.DE                          |\n| Bloomberg                   | CWC GR                           |\n| Date of initial quotation   | March 24, 1993                   |\n| Number of shares            | 7,442,003 units                  |\n| Daily volume (2023 average) | 4,906 units                      |\n| Annual high in 2023         | 102.00 euros                     |\n| Annual low in 2023          | 82.40 euros                      |\n| Year-end price 2023         | 101.20 euros                     |\n\nImage /page/40/Figure/11 description: The image shows a line graph comparing the CEWE share price with the DAX and SDAX indices from January 1, 2023, to March 1, 2024.

The graph indicates an annual low of 82.40 euros and an annual high of 102.00 euros.\n\nto fixed-interest investments. Small and mid caps were particularly badly affected by this development, since in many cases the group of potential investors likewise shrank here. While there were some initial indications of an opening of the primary market in 2023, even IPOs and spin-offs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland with higher levels of capitalisation were only placeable subject to considerable markdowns.\n\nFrom a segment point of view, blue chip companies in the Eurozone and the USA especially performed very strongly. In this context, at the end of the year Germany's DAX index reached a new all-time high of 17,003 points. In addition, the AI boom – which started with the launch of ChatGPT – triggered an upswing for many technology stocks. However, due to the ongoing high level of general uncertainty, above all stocks with low levels of liquidity and market capitalisation were subject to further markdowns. This in turn led to a mixed performance for Germany's share\n\nindexes. The DAX ended 2023 up 20.3 %, the MDAX rose by just 8.0 %, the SDAX performed more strongly, with growth of 17.0 %, while the TecDAX picked up by 14.3 %. The Scale All Share lost – 3.6 % and the Scale 30 as much as – 15.8 %.\n\n#### **CEWE share rises by 14.1 % in 2023**\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, the CEWE share achieved strong growth of 14.1 % and ended the year with a yearend price of 101.20 euros (year-end price 2022: 88.70 euros). Its performance was thus roughly in line with that of all 70 SDAX companies, whose market value rose by around 17 % on average. The average monthly volume of trading of the CEWE share on the XETRA index was roughly 9.7 million euros in 2023 (monthly average in 2021: 15.6 million euros). The weaker trading turnover of the CEWE share went hand in hand with an overall decrease in the volume of order book turnover in 2023 for all listed companies in XETRA trading.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nSmall and mid-caps such as CEWE were once again particularly badly affected here, since investors preferred highly liquid DAX stocks in particular and thus further reduced trading volumes for smaller companies.\n\n→ CEWE share\n\n#### **CEWE has strengthened its position in the SDAX**\n\nCompanies are allocated to a specific German stock index according to their level of \"market capitalisation\". Moreover, the German stock exchange regularly reviews whether a company meets the requirements for a particular level of minimum liquidity. The CEWE share clearly exceeds the minimum liquidity requirements; in terms of market capitalisation, CEWE moved up to 129th position at the end of 2023 (December 31, 2022: 137th position). The CEWE share has thus strengthened its position on the SDAX index, which normally features shares with a ranking of 165 or higher.\n\n#### **Dividend for 2023 to rise for a 15th consecutive occasion**\n\nWith a goal of dividend continuity, CEWE seeks to issue a dividend every year which ideally increases, but is at least unchanged in absolute terms, where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities. For the financial year 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA will propose to the general meeting an increase in the dividend to 2.60 euros for each share conferring a dividend entitlement (dividend for the financial year 2022: 2.45 euros). On the basis of the 2023 year-end price of 101.20 euros, this corresponds to a dividend yield of 2.6 %. If the general meeting which will be held on June 5, 2024 agrees to this proposal, this will be the highest dividend in the company's history and also a 15th consecutive dividend increase.

KG, Oldenburg) and Dr Caroline Neumüller (CN Assets GmbH & Co. KG, Oldenburg) – are CEWE's largest shareholders, with a combined interest of 27.1 %, and the company has thus enjoyed a high level of ownership stability for many years now. The group of notifiable investors with shareholdings in excess of 5 % also includes Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH. The small and mid-cap orientation of its fund means that it fits perfectly with CEWE.\n\n#### **The CEWE equity story: dependable stability, consistent rise in profitability, a market leader with steady growth**\n\nWhat makes investing in CEWE particularly attractive? CEWE's equity story can be summed up in terms of the following four aspects:\n\n> For many years, CEWE has enjoyed a high degree of ownership stability.\n\n#### **Shareholder structure** as % (100 % = 7.4 million shares)\n\nImage /page/42/Figure/12 description: The image shows a pie chart and a list of shareholders with their respective percentages. CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg has 4.2%, the heirs of the company's founder, Heinz Neumüller, have 27.1%, Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH has 5.1%, and other shareholders have 63.6%.\n\n#### 1. Dependable stability\n\nThanks to its strong equity ratio of almost 60 % and a very solid net cash position, CEWE has an extremely solid balance sheet. Demand (above all in Photofinishing) is largely independent of the general economic situation. Balance sheet stability and a stable level of demand provide very reliable and solid foundations for CEWE.\n\n#### 2. Consistent rise in profitability\n\nThe earnings margin of CEWE's Photofinishing core business unit – which has steadily risen for some years and is protected by strong brands – and its Commercial Online Printing business unit's long-term improvement in profitability promise further growth in earnings for the entire CEWE Group in future.\n\n#### 3. A market leader with steady growth\n\nAs a market leader and thus natural consolidator in the photofinishing sector, CEWE enjoys growth opportunities in many European countries. Moreover, innovations and the continuous development of new products are in CEWE's DNA. The trend towards smartphone photography and the use of artificial intelligence for product configuration and ordering underpin this growth.\n\n#### 4. Strong results\n\nWith earnings rising consistently for many years (as explained in the \"Long-term trend\" section above) and with a very respectable return on capital employed (ROCE), CEWE has not least proven to be an extremely reliable dividend payer: CEWE's dividend proposal for the financial year 2023 represents a 15th consecutive dividend increase for its shareholders.\n\nImage /page/42/Figure/21 description: The image shows the number 15 in a bold, sans-serif font. The number is a bright blue color and is set against a white background.\n\nyears of unbroken dividend growth: CEWE thus remains among the top three of all 644 listed companies in Germany!**1**\n\n#### **CEWE is there for its shareholders**\n\nThe clear objective of investor relations activities at CEWE is to notify all market participants promptly, comprehensively and equally in line with the principles of fair disclosure, while achieving a high level of overall transparency.\n\nCEWE thus naturally also publishes all of its annual and interim reports and capital market information online at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/3000/news-_-publications.html#main-body)**. All analyst telephone conferences are made available as webcasts and audiocasts on CEWE's website.

The key issues were presented to the other members of the committee no later than the next committee meeting.\n\nFollowing its appointment by the 2023 general meeting, the Audit Committee engaged the auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, including the combined management report for CEWE & Co. KGaA and the Group and to review the semi-annual financial report for the financial year 2023. In this regard, the Audit Committee determined the audit fee and discussed the key audit matters. It was agreed that the auditor would immediately notify the Supervisory Board of any incidents and findings resulting during the audit which are of material significance for the tasks of the Supervisory Board. Appropriate parameters were stipulated for the provision of non-audit services permitted under the relevant EU legislation. The Audit Committee satisfied itself of the auditor's necessary independence. The Audit Committee also engaged the auditor to review the consolidated, separate non-financial statement for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group – which is prepared in the form of a separate non-financial\n\nreport – as well as the remuneration report within the meaning of § 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) and the report on related parties within the meaning of § 312 AktG. The remuneration report is made available to the general public via CEWE's website.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the financial reporting of the company and the Group, including the intrayear financial reports (quarterly statements and the semi-annual financial report) and discussed these with the Board of Management. For this purpose, the auditor reported on the results of the audit activities which it had been tasked to undertake by the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management and on other findings and incidents of significance for the work of the Audit Committee. There were no objections.\n\nThe Audit Committee also examined the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal Group-wide control and risk management system as well as the ongoing development of the latter. In addition, the quarterly risk reports were discussed. The Audit Committee also discussed the reports provided by the compliance officer on compliance within the Group as well as significant legal disputes and the internal auditing department's status report.\n\nThe Audit Committee moreover considered CEWE's sustainability reporting and implementation of the reporting requirements arising from the EU Taxonomy and CSRD regulation. In the year under review, the Audit Committee once again ensured that it was kept regularly informed of any changes to the regulatory environment and discussed required measures, including the impact of the German Act Transposing the EU Minimum Tax Directive.\n\nThe auditor's provision of non-audit services and compliance with the parameters stipulated in this regard were monitored and adjustments were made.\n\nThe Board of Management also presented its report on transactions with related parties. There were no transactions requiring approval within the meaning of § 111b AktG.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>47</sup> → Report of the Supervisory Board\n\ntion 5 Financial Stateme\n\n← 🔍 < 47 >\n\nAn additional focus of the Audit Committee in the financial year 2023 – due to the required regular external rotation of the auditor upon expiry of the financial year 2023 – was the implementation of a transparent and discrimination-free process for the selection of the auditor for the financial year 2024. For this purpose, at its ordinary meeting on August 2, 2023 the Audit Committee had resolved to initiate a tender process pursuant to Art. 16 of the EU Audit Regulation. Following a multistage process and a careful review of the tendering firms in terms of their qualifications and independence, the Audit Committee passed a resolution on this matter at its meeting of November 7, 2023. The Audit Committee provided the Supervisory Board with a recommendation (including the reasons for this) that a proposal be made to the general meeting for either Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg, or PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Bremen, to be appointed as the auditor of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2024 and to review the semi-annual financial report for the financial year 2024. The Audit Committee justified its preference for Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg.\n\nAt its balance sheet meeting held on March 18, 2024, in the presence of the auditor the Audit Committee discussed the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group, and the consolidated, separate non-financial report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Group for the financial year 2023, including the auditor's audit reports and audit opinions, the related proposal for the appropriation of profits, the remuneration report and the report on related parties. It also prepared the corresponding resolutions to be adopted by the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee was provided with detailed information on the audit activities and audit findings of the auditor for the parent company as well as its German and foreign subsidiaries, particularly in relation to the key audit matters and the defined core audit areas. The audit of the accounting-related internal control system and the early risk detection system were also discussed in depth. The Audit Committee also considered the audit process and its level of quality at this meeting. Further members of the Supervisory Board were also able to attend this balance sheet meeting of the Audit Committee as guests.\n\n#### **Corporate governance**\n\nIn the year under review, the Supervisory Board had eight female members (until June 7, 2023)/six female members (from June 7, 2023) and four male members (until June 7, 2023)/six male members (from June 7, 2023) and thus continued to fulfil the Supervisory Board quota which is required by law.\n\nFor the financial year 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board have submitted an updated declaration of conformity in accordance with § 161 AktG, which is available on the company's website. In addition, in the management declaration – which the Supervisory Board adopts as its own – the Board of Management reports on corporate governance at CEWE (available at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/6000/corporate-governance.html)** – see Corporate governance/Declaration).\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nIn the reporting period, there were no conflicts of interest on the part of members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board which must be immediately disclosed to the Supervisory Board and notified to the general meeting.\n\n#### **Initial and advanced training**\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board independently receive the initial and advanced training that they require for their tasks. CEWE assists the members of the Supervisory Board here by providing them with access to membership of an online supervisory board portal with relevant instruction materials and reference works. New members of the Supervisory Board are able to obtain an overview of the company (onboarding) by discussing key matters and current topics with the Board of Management and the executives concerned.\n\n#### **Changes to the makeup of the executive bodies**\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung appointed Ms Yvonne Rostock, Ratingen, as the Chairwoman of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung. She took up her post on March 1, 2023.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>48</sup> → Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn 2023, regular elections to the Supervisory Board were held for the next term of office of around five years, i.e. up to the end of the general meeting which grants discharge to the Supervisory Board members for the fourth financial year since the start of their term of office, not including the financial year in which this term of office begins. The Supervisory Board members Ms Patricia Geibel-Conrad, Ms Marion Gerdes, Mr Alexander Oyen, Ms Elwira Wall and Mr Frank Zweigle retired from the Supervisory Board on June 7, 2023. On the other hand, Ms Daniela Mattheus and Mr Kersten Duwe were elected to the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA by the general meeting, while Mr Marc Bohlken, Mr Nural Altan and Mr Jan Grüneberg were elected to this executive body by CEWE's employees. These new members were in each case elected for the first time. The other members of the Supervisory Board were re-elected.\n\n#### **Annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, audit**\n\nThe annual financial statements and the management report, combined with the management report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, have been prepared by the Board of Management in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), while the consolidated financial statements and the combined consolidated management report have been prepared in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applied in the European Union (EU), as well as the provisions of German law which apply in addition under § 315e (1) HGB.\n\nBDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg – which was appointed as the auditor for the financial year 2023 by the general meeting – audited the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the consolidated management report combined with the management report for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the financial year 2023, including the accounting, and issued an unqualified auditor's opinion in each case. Mr Jörg Sabath and Mr Christoph Hyckel have acted as the company's auditors. Mr Jörg Sabath has done so since the financial year 2019 and Mr Christoph Hyckel – as the auditor with responsibility for the audit – since the financial year 2021. The auditor also determined that the Board of Management has established an appropriate information and monitoring system which is suitable in order to identify early on any developments which jeopardise the continuation of the company as a going concern.\n\nAt its meeting held on March 18, 2024, the Audit Committee initially verified on the basis of the audit reports and the Board of Management's report that these two sets of financial statements and the combined management report provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in compliance with applicable accounting regulations. At this meeting, the auditor discussed in detail the process as well as the key findings of its audit of the separate financial statements and the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, including the key audit matters and the other core audit areas. The audit of the non-financial reporting and the remuneration report were also explained and discussed in detail. The auditor was available throughout the meeting to answer any further questions. In particular, it reported on the structure of the accounting-related internal controls and the risk management system. It did not report any significant weaknesses. The Chairwoman of the Audit Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on the audit findings on March 19, 2024.\n\nFor its part, the Supervisory Board also audited the annual financial statements, the proposal for appropriation of the unappropriated profits for 2023 as well as the consolidated financial statements, the combined consolidated management report and the remuneration report for the financial year 2023. All of these documents – including the auditor's audit reports – were provided in good time. The auditor was also present at the balance sheet meeting of the Supervisory Board held on March 19, 2024 and was available to provide further information. Additional questions from the members of the Supervisory Board prompted an in-depth discussion of the presented findings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was able to verify the appropriateness of the general partner's proposal for appropriation of unappropriated profits in relation to the company's net assets, financial position and results of operations and agreed to this proposal, following a discussion in the presence of the auditor. Finally, the Supervisory Board complied with its audit obligation under § 171 (1) sentence 4 AktG in relation to the consolidated nonfinancial statement and did not raise any objections.\n\nFollowing a preliminary audit by the Audit Committee at a meeting held on March 18, 2024, at its meeting of March 19, 2024 the Supervisory Board endorsed the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA as well as the combined management report, and found that there were no grounds for objections. Following the discussion at its balance sheet meeting held on March 19, 2024, the Supervisory Board agreed to the general partner's proposal to the general meeting to approve the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and moreover issued its consent to the general partner's proposal for the appropriation of profits, with the distribution of a dividend of 2.60 euros.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Report on related parties**\n\nThe Supervisory Board's independent audit likewise covered the report prepared by the general partner pursuant to § 312 AktG on relationships with affiliates (report on related parties) for the year under review. The report on related parties has also been audited by the auditor, which has issued the following audit opinion for this report:\n\n\"Upon due completion of our audit and assessment, we hereby confirm that\n\n- 1. the factual statements provided in the report are accurate,\n- 2. the company has not made any disproportionately large payment for any of the legal transactions listed in the report.\"\n\nThe report on related parties and the audit report of the auditor on the report on related parties were available to the Audit Committee at its meeting held on March 18, 2024 and to all of the members of the Supervisory Board at its balance sheet meeting held on March 19, 2024. Even after consultation with the auditor and the Board of Management following the final outcome of its audit, the Supervisory Board has not raised any objections in relation to the general partner's declaration at the end of its report on related parties. The Supervisory Board has approvingly noted the outcome of the auditor's audit of the report on related parties.\n\nOldenburg, March 19, 2024\n\nThe Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Its segment reporting by business unit also reflects these strategic business units (together with a further business unit, Other Activities).\n\n#### **The core business unit: Photofinishing**\n\nPhotofinishing is the name we give to our photo products business. CEWE is the European market leader in photofinishing, previously based on analogue film and now replaced by digital data. CEWE PHOTOBOOK has established itself as the key product in this field. CEWE has also continuously and rigorously expanded its product range.\n\nThrough its product management strategy, CEWE is not only developing new products but also strengthening demand and sales through its product and brand communication activities. Consumers can purchase CEWE's photofinishing products from business partners supplied by CEWE and also from CEWE directly. For almost all of the photofinishing products ordered from CEWE, CEWE also handles acceptance of orders and customer communication.\n\nEurope accounts for almost 100 % of CEWE's Photofinishing business.\n\n#### **CEWE RETAIL: proprietary hardware retail business is also a distribution channel for photofinishing products**\n\nCEWE has multichannel retailing operations for photo hardware and photofinishing products in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Scandinavia. In addition to selling photo hardware, over-the-counter outlets and online shops are a key channel for distributing CEWE photo products directly to end-consumers. Turnover and income from photofinishing products are shown in the Photofinishing business unit.\n\n#### **Commercial Online Printing: printing products for the commercial sector**\n\nCEWE is active in its Commercial Online Printing business unit through the production and marketing of printed advertising media via the distribution platforms SAXO-PRINT, viaprinto and LASERLINE. CEWE operates its Commercial Online Printing business unit for printed advertising media in Germany and other European countries, where local websites are present. The depth of added value in Commercial Online Printing is very similar to Photofinishing. However, CEWE provides less software here for the creation of printed products (unlike in the case of CEWE PHOTOBOOK, for instance).\n\nImage /page/53/Picture/17 description: The image shows logos of different companies. From left to right, the first row contains the logos of \"cewe\", \"pixum\", \"WHITE WALL\", and \"DeinDesign.\". The second row contains the logos of \"Cheerz\", \"SAXOPRINT\", and \"viaprinto\".\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>Organisation and management systems\n\n#### **Organisational structure**\n\nThe CEWE business group has the following structure:\n\nImage /page/54/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart. At the top left is a box labeled \"Limited shareholders\" which points to a box labeled \"General meeting\". To the right of the \"General meeting\" box is a box labeled \"Board of Trustees\". The \"General meeting\" box points to a box labeled \"Supervisory Board\". The \"Board of Trustees\" box points to a box labeled \"General partner: Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\". Both the \"Supervisory Board\" and the \"General partner: Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\" boxes point to a blue box labeled \"CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg (operating business)\".\n\n**[see Board of Management, pages 185 f.](#page-186-0)**\n\nIn 2023, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung was represented by seven members of the Board of Management. The Group's other 3,896 staff (2023 average) were employed by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the subordinate Group companies.\n\n#### **Legal structure combines the advantages of the capital market and a family approach**\n\nThe legal form of a partnership limited by shares enables the CEWE Group to combine the typical strengths of capitalmarket-oriented companies with those of family firms.\n\nThe company's founder, Senator h.c. Heinz Neumüller, intended to ensure that his entrepreneurial principles would remain permanently established within the company. He also aimed to ensure the company's long-term future. This is safeguarded through Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the large interest held by AN Assets GmbH & Co. KG and CN Assets GmbH & Co. KG (the heirs of the company's founder, Heinz Neumüller, and the company's largest shareholders with a combined 27.1 % stake, **[see Shareholder Structure, page 41](#page-42-0)**). The former ensures that the business group continues to be managed true to the legacy of Heinz Neumüller and thus upholds the character of the family firm. It stands for a long-term orientation in terms of the company's business policy. For this reason, it is also responsible for its management.\n\nThe company's founder always demanded that the CEWE business group should operate innovatively, while optimising income. The capital market effectively promotes these entrepreneurial objectives. The decision-making of the company's executive bodies – i.e. its management and its Supervisory Board – reflects its shareholders' interest in an attractive investment, with the goal of solid and sustainable long-term growth in the value of the company and thus of their investment. **[see Results, from page 61](#page-62-0)**\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nManagement Report 4\n\neration 5 Financial St\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>In the view of the Board of Management, the combination of these two advantages enables an innovative company which is managed on the basis of an income-oriented and sustainable business model and which also lives up to its social responsibility as an employer and as an economic engine.\n\nAs its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is entitled to receive reimbursement from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA or for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA to bear any expenses resulting in connection with its management activities. For its management activities and to cover its personal liability Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung receives annual remuneration – irrespective of any profit or loss – in the amount of 50,000 euros plus any value added tax applicable.\n\n#### **CEWE operates through a total of 35 subsidiaries**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is the parent company which manages all of the CEWE Group's activities. Retail is directly combined with Photofinishing in countries where a production plant is present. Otherwise, it operates independently. From an operational point of view, photo products are also sold through the Group's retail companies. However, in terms of strategic management they form part of the Photofinishing business unit, since they follow an entirely different growth path and their strategic significance differs from that of photo hardware, which is reported in the Retail business unit.\n\n#### **Management of the CEWE Group**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is responsible for overall planning and fulfilment of the goals of the CEWE Group. The allocation of responsibilities is set out in the \"Other disclosures\" section of the Notes **1 [see pages 185 f](#page-186-0)**.\n\n#### **Regular strategic planning: economic forecast reflects identifiable trends**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung determines the long-term strategy of the CEWE Group. This reflects trends in CEWE's competitive, market and technological environment. The Board of Management reviews the company's strategic orientation several times a year and discusses the resulting tactical and operational measures. External experts also take part in these meetings, where necessary. At least once a year, the company's current strategy is discussed with its supervisory bodies as well as its executives, and the core aspects of this strategy are communicated within the company.\n\n#### **Investments on the basis of profitability calculations**\n\nInvestments which consistently assume profitability calculations and which entail continuous as well as follow-up monitoring also form part of the company's corporate planning.\n\n#### **Close monitoring through monthly target/actual comparisons**\n\nEvery month, a target/actual comparison is implemented for the strategic business units and for each of the profit centres as well as for the CEWE Group as a whole. This monitoring includes the profit centres of the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. These target/previous year/actual comparisons enable close monitoring of goal achievement and an early response by the Board of Management and the management. At the same time, these and other operating indicators of the production plants and the distribution companies are passed on to all of the managers of these profit centres, for internal benchmarking and discussion. The key financial performance indicators used at CEWE are outlined in the \"Goals and strategies\" section **see pages 54 f**.\n\n#### Goals and strategies\n\nFindings derived from market research and strategic activities are factored into CEWE's long-term forecast model and provide CEWE's management with a perspective on possible future profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, cash flows and the company's enterprise value.\n\n#### **Continuous business development: CEWE defines initiatives and consistently follows through on them**\n\nOn the basis of this forecast, CEWE defines initiatives so as to drive forward its future development in the interest of the company and its various stakeholders. The effect of these initiatives is also factored into CEWE's forecast model. Within the scope of the structures outlined above, the company's management thus continuously monitors the implementation of these initiatives. In this way, CEWE is evolving all the time.\n\n#### **A focus on long-term profit and enterprise value**\n\nThrough these measures, CEWE clearly focuses on optimising its long-term business performance. Earnings for a single quarter or even for an entire year are viewed within the perspective of the company's long-term development. CEWE thinks in terms of decades.\n\n#### **The goal: profitable and capital-efficient growth, which will boost enterprise value**\n\nThe supreme long-term goal of the CEWE Group is continuously profitable and capital-efficient growth. For this purpose, CEWE uses both financial and non-financial performance indicators, for which annual target figures are published. No target figures are published for the additional, balance-sheet-related performance indicators.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nfigure for the following year is indicated in the forecast. not discussed in external communications. **Turnover and EBIT/EBT are very closely monitored for operational purposes** CEWE analyses its turnover trend every day in all of its units (but not for the consolidated Group) and conducts a monthly review of its earnings (incl. EBT) as key variables. The financial statements prepared by all of the Group's companies are likewise consolidated and analysed in a target/actual/previous-year comparison. Deviations from target figures and previous-year figures are assessed in\n\n#### → Basic information on the Group\n\n**Non-financial performance indicators: number of photos and CEWE PHOTOBOOKS**\n\nCEWE uses the total number of photos as a non-financial performance indicator in the Photofinishing business unit. These photos also include all of the images which are used in value-added products (e.g. CEWE PHOTOBOOK, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and other photo gifts). Due to the key significance of this product, the number of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS produced is shown as a separate indicator. CEWE's management analyses all of these indicators at least weekly, and in some cases daily. CEWE also provides information on its development in its annual report, by means of a target/actual comparison, and discusses this in the \"Results\" chapter **[see page 61](#page-62-0)**. A target Non-financial performance indicators do not play such a significant role in Commercial Online Printing and thus are\n\nterms of their effect on financial goals. The responsible individuals already account for any such discrepancies through comments during preparation of the company's reports. The earnings of the company's strategic business\n\nunits are monitored at the level of turnover and EBIT. The Board of Management discusses every month both earnings in the strategic business units and for the Group as a whole and the detailed figures for the individual profit centres. This monitoring includes the profit centres of the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nInvestments are an important indicator, since they have a significant impact on the volume of capital employed (which is practically irreversible over the useful life of the capital item) and (besides the earnings figure) have the largest impact on free cash flow. The situation differs for the additional indicator \"Operating working capital\", as outlined further below. CEWE therefore monitors investments very closely. Beyond the volume already authorised, subsequent increases in these areas are not possible without further authorisation from the responsible investment managers. Consolidated investment reporting\n\nis provided at least quarterly in the first half of the year. During the phase of larger investments – i.e. in preparation for year-end business – the management reviews this indicator every month.\n\n#### **Additional indicators: ROCE, free cash flow and operating working capital**\n\nIn each quarterly statement and every quarterly and annual report, CEWE analyses its ROCE figure to determine the rate of return on its capital employed. For many years now, CEWE has achieved figures above the 15 % mark. Since CEWE's pre-tax capital cost rate has been below 10 % for some years now, according to analysts' calculations in their research reports, CEWE is certainly delivering increasing value. The long-term goal is a ROCE figure which continues to clearly exceed the capital costs.\n\n#### **CEWE performance indicators**\n\n|                          |                        | Internal reporting | External reporting | Forecast for the year |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Non-financial indicators | Total number of photos | Week               | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | CEWE PHOTOBOOKS        |                    |                    | yes                   |\n| Financial indicators     | Turnover               | Day                | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | EBIT                   | Month              |                    | yes                   |\n|                          | EBT                    |                    |                    | yes                   |\n|                          | Investments            | Month/quarter      | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | Earnings after tax     | Quarter            | Quarter            | yes                   |\n|                          | Earnings per share     |                    |                    | yes                   |\n| Additional indicators    | ROCE                   | Quarter            | Quarter            | -                     |\n|                          | Free cash flow         |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Operating WC           |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Equity ratio           |                    |                    | -                     |\n|                          | Dividend               | Year               | Year               | -                     |\n\nWE focus on initiatives\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/16 description: The image shows a document with the titles of different sections.

As well as investments – which are closely monitored, as already mentioned – and EBIT, the development of operating working capital is a key factor affecting capital employed and the free cash flow. This figure is therefore explained together with the ROCE and the free cash flow. As already outlined above, more frequent assessment of this figure is not necessary, since undesirable effects on working capital as of the reporting date can generally be compensated for on a short-term basis. For instance, a business partner's year-end payment which is delayed by just a few days can easily reduce the company's free cash flow by several million euros. While any such development will naturally be closely monitored, in operational terms it is generally meaningless, particularly since other operational monitoring systems highlight such delays much more directly than the cash flow statement does. Moreover, from the point of view of its outflow of liquidity, CEWE's liquidity is so strong that the company is able to exploit an earnings opportunity, even on a shortterm basis, to the detriment of its liquidity.\n\n#### **Solid balance sheet: equity ratio as a further indicator**\n\nCEWE aims to ensure the company's continuous and sustainable development. For instance, the indicators of a strong balance sheet include sufficient cash reserves, available lines of credit and a solid equity ratio. At the present time, CEWE considers its level of capitalisation to be stable, with an equity ratio in excess of 50 %. In CEWE's opinion, sufficient liquidity or sufficient lines of credit and an extremely solid equity capital position (also by comparison with the competition) not only boost the company's stability and resilience in the event of a crisis, they also enable it to purposefully exploit any strategic options which become available, such as attractive acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe company's ROCE, free cash flow, working capital and equity ratio are analysed in further detail in the quarterly financial statements. Due to possible short-term setbacks which may arise for the company's cash flow or working capital, as outlined above, no precise planning variables are stated for these additional indicators. Due to their significance, these indicators are discussed in detail in the \"Results\" chapter **[see page 61](#page-62-0)**.\n\n#### **Goal: absolute annual dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE has the declared goal of offering its shareholders a dividend on the basis of its earnings figure which increases slightly each year, where possible, or is at least constant, if the company's economic situation permits this. The distribution ratio is explicitly not a control variable, and is rather the outcome of this dividend policy.\n\n#### Research & development\n\nIn December 2023, almost exactly three out of four images transferred from the order processing clients to CEWE's production plants for production had been taken by smartphones. This proportion is roughly uniform for all ordering channels (desktop, mobile and CEWE Photostation). In this year, it was once again clear that CEWE is pursuing the right approach for its brands by offering solutions for computers, browsers and apps and that the effort of supporting all of the main operating systems and integrating in the design process relevant online storage locations such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft is paying off. The links between these ordering channels and CEWE Photostations – via CEWE myPhotos or directly via the smartphone app – and thus support for our omnichannel approach were again bolstered in the year under review and are set to be expanded even further.\n\nThe applications developed at CEWE's \"Mobile and Artificial Intelligence Campus\" (MAIC) were expanded and also rolled out to subsidiaries during the reporting year and (in the Board of Management's view) further enhanced. They also gained new features which make the experience of designing products even more fun. These include an AIbased design process functionality which optimally determines the relevant section of an image which will fit an available frame and another functionality (also AIbased) which suggests the right background colours for a page.\n\nThese types of changes were incorporated in the various ordering channels. Significant further improvements (in the company's view) were made to the customer service chatbot, in terms of functionalities and the user experience, and this chatbot was also made available to our subsidiaries. Feedback from customers is encouraging us to continue down this path and make greater use of our bot to handle simple and frequently submitted queries.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remun\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>57</sup>\n\nThese and all of CEWE's other artificial intelligence applications (also combined with traditional algorithms) are transparently presented in CEWE's customer charter at **1 [www.cewe.ai](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/customer-charter-and-advisory-council.html)**, and a number of further applications were added in 2023. The benefit for customers and protection of their privacy are always the prime considerations. Images will not be transferred to public albums or to servers outside the scope of the GDPR or else to third parties for marketing purposes. Consumers retain full control over the whereabouts of their images and their analysis in order to suggest design ideas.\n\n#### **My CEWE PHOTOWORLD**\n\nConsumers generally use our software \"My CEWE PHOTO-WORLD\" to produce CEWE PHOTOBOOKS. This software is available for Windows, Mac and Linux computers and for Android and iOS smartphones. Many CEWE customers are therefore transferring their images from their smartphones to their computers. Customers have long recognised the benefit of transferring their images to a computer when placing an order with CEWE: the design process is even faster and more intuitive, and transferring pictures to a PC also means that important images are backed up. Further MAIC functions have been incorporated for this purpose. This has brought further improvements to the design process for individual pages, but also to the auto-suggest function in the desktop software and smartphone app versions of the CEWE PHOTOBOOK assistant. As regards CEWE's smartphone apps, a new editor function for placing orders was completed for CEWE Calendar ahead of the Christmas season and made available to the company's customers. This has resulted in a further increase in the conversion rate, but above all in the level of customer satisfaction.\n\nNew products have been integrated in every category. CEWE PHOTOBOOK has been equipped with additional designs and templates for the yearbook campaign as well as finishes, while CEWE Calendar and gift items have gained attractive designs in particular. In the Board of Management's opinion, consumers very rapidly responded to these additional offerings, in order to produce even more attractive gifts for Christmas. The desktop software was launched in Germany and Austria in time for Christmas, while the new apps were available in all of the countries to which CEWE delivers.\n\n#### **COPS – the CEWE ONLINE PRINTING SYSTEM**\n\nHere too, a lot of work has been done on the editor functions which enable customers to order products. Above all, this is reflected in terms of the increased use of smartphones to order so-called \"single-image products\". Smartphone use has picked up strongly here, since customers do not necessarily wish to install an app for this on their devices. The Board of Management assumes that the company has fully achieved its goals of enhanced presentation of products and product details and, above all, improving the mobile journey for customers. This has also provided for a more uniform appearance across the range of ordering channels and further refined the company's omnichannel approach for this ordering channel too.\n\n#### **High-performance back-end system further optimised and AI-based function improved**\n\nIn the year under review, CEWE invested in increased bandwidths for the transfer of image data from its online platform to its production plants. These investments covered its primary and backup cables. This means that data can now be transferred at a faster rate, supporting the ambitious goal of completing deliveries in time for Christmas. All of the above-mentioned applications and orders placed at the retail outlets of CEWE's business partners through CEWE PHOTOSTATIONS deliver finalised jobs to CEWE's back-end system. This back-end system continues to be distributed across two independent and redundant data centres. To ensure rapid transmission of these data volumes from the central data centres to the company's production plants, as usual the necessary additional servers were installed ahead of the Christmas season. Low-resolution images (e.g. from WhatsApp) are resized using AI methods (generative adversarial networks – GANs) and improved versions were tested and implemented in the year under review. We are thus delivering better product results for large-scale images such as a big CEWE Calendar.\n\nThe company also implemented further measures in order to optimise the sustainability of its IT processes. CEWE has once again reduced the volume of racks required in its data centres and thus their level of electricity consumption by means of further virtualisation as well as new highercapacity servers and storage devices.\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** This symbol indicates that further information may be found on the Internet.

It averaged 5.7 % over the year 2023 as a whole. This corresponds to a 0.4 percentage-point increase by comparison with 2022. This is primarily attributable to the large number of immigrants, and refugees especially. From roughly mid-2022, Ukrainian refugees were covered by Germany's social security system.**3**\n\nIn 2023, as in the previous year inflation in Germany was exceptionally high in historical terms. On average over the past year, the HICP inflation rate amounted to 6.0 % (2022: 8.7 %), but the rate of inflation declined significantly over the course of the year. What remained a high level of inflation reflected the very strong increases in food prices, which continued to rise by comparison with the previous year, 2022. Price growth for services was also stronger in\n\n**6** Destatis: [https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-](https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-Finanzen/Inflation.html)\n\n**7** Statista: [https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/) [ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/201216/umfrage/ezb-zinssatz-fuer-das-hauptrefinanzierungsgeschaeft-seit-1999/)\n\n[Finanzen/Inflation.html](https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/Wirtschaft-Finanzen/Inflation.html)\n\n2023 than previously.**4** At the same time, nominal wages also picked up strongly in Germany: in the third quarter of 2023, they increased by 6.3 % on the same quarter in the previous year, while consumer prices climbed by 5.7 % in the same period. Real wages were thus 0.6 % higher than in the same quarter in the previous year.**5**\n\n#### **High inflation and ten consecutive interest-rate hikes**\n\nWorldwide, inflation was running at 6.8 % in 2023. Inflation in the EU, measured in terms of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), averaged 6.4 % in 2023. Price momentum decreased by comparison with the previous year (2022: 9.2 %): the highest price rises were registered for \"food and non-alcoholic beverages\" (12.6 %) and \"restaurants and accommodation services\" (8.4 %). On a monthly basis, in December 2023 inflation in the Eurozone fell to 2.9 %; the highest rate of inflation in the Eurozone's history, around 10.6 %, had been registered in October 2022.**6** On July 21, 2022, the European Central Bank reacted to the strong inflationary momentum and raised interest rates in the Eurozone for the first time in eleven years: from zero to 0.5 %. This was followed by a series of nine further interest-rate hikes. Following its tenth consecutive interestrate rise on September 14, 2023, from October 26, 2023 onwards the ECB finally left its key interest rate at 4.5 %.**7**\n\nThe euro's exchange rate against the US dollar averaged 1.0813 euros in 2023 and thus clearly exceeded the previous year's average of 1.0530 euros (2022) – with a fluctuation range between 1.1255 (July 18, 2023) and 1.0469 (October 3, 2023). As regards the currencies of relevance for CEWE, **<sup>1</sup>** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff.\n\nMarkets\n\nEconomic report\n\n#### **High inflation dampens global economic growth**\n\nAccording to the current estimate from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global growth rate in 2023 was just 3.1 % (2022: 3.5 %). Growth in the developed economies fell from 2.6 % in 2022 to 1.6 % in 2023. With a rate of 0.5 % in 2023, the Eurozone's economy registered significantly slower growth than in the previous year (2022: 3.5 %).**1**\n\nAccording to the IMF's estimates, in the second half of 2023 especially economic growth in the United States and several major emerging markets and developing countries was stronger than expected. Government and private spending made real contributions to this upswing. Increases in disposable income are buoying consumption in the context of labour markets which remain tense, even if they are easing. Households fell back on the savings they had accumulated during the pandemic. A broadbased increase in labour market participation and the resolution of the supply chain problems inherited from the pandemic era contributed to growth on the supply side. However, this growing momentum was not apparent everywhere: the dampened rate of growth in the Eurozone especially reflected weak consumer sentiment, the\n\n## continuing effects of high energy prices and weakness in terms of interest rate-sensitive productive and corporate investments.**2**\n\n#### **Recession in Germany**\n\nAccording to the IMF, Germany's real gross domestic product contracted by – 0.3 % in 2023, following growth of 1.8 % in the previous year. In 2023, Germany thus once again fell considerably short of the 0.5 % average growth\n\n→ Economic report\n\n<span id=\"page-59-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>58</sup>\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Economic report\n\nent Report 4 Ren\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>59</sup>\n\nthe euro gained value against the Swedish crown, the Norwegian crown and the British pound but fell against the Czech crown, the Polish zloty and the Swiss franc. The value of the euro against the Swedish crown averaged SEK 11.4788 over the course of the year and thus rose by around 8 %, reaching a significantly higher level than in the previous year (2022: SEK 10.6296) – with a minimum level of 11.0030 SEK (February 24) and a maximum of 11.9872 (September 18, 2023). Against the Norwegian crown, the euro picked up significantly during the year, by 13 % to NOK 11.4248 (2022: NOK 10.1026) – with a fluctuation range between NOK 10.5135 (January 2, 2023) and NOK 12.0045 (May 31, 2023). The euro also gained ground against the British pound: the exchange rate over the course of the year averaged GBP 0.86979 per euro (2022: GBP 0.85276) – with a fluctuation range between GBP 0.85110 (July 11, 2023) and GBP 0.89338 (February 7, 2023). Against the Czech crown the euro averaged CZK 24.004 and was thus a good two per cent lower than in the previous year (2022: CZK 24.566) – with a fluctuation range between CZK 23.271 (April 13, 2023) and CZK 24.724 (December 29, 2023). Against the Polish zloty, the value of the euro fell slightly over the course of the year to 4.5420 zloty (2022: 4.6861 zloty) – with a fluctuation range between 4.3090 (December 15, 2023) and 4.7875 zloty (February 13, 2023). The euro lost even more ground against the Swiss franc: on average in 2023, the euro's value fell to 0.9718 francs (2022: 1.0047 francs) – with a minimum level of 0.9260 francs (December 29, 2023) and a maximum of 1.0056 francs (January 12, 2023).**1**\n\n#### **CEWE remains largely independent of cyclical trends**\n\nIn a difficult macroeconomic environment characterised by strong inflation, in the financial year 2023 CEWE was once again largely independent of cyclical trends, particularly in its Photofinishing core business unit. In the financial year 2023 CEWE was once again able to compensate for the inflation-related cost increases by raising its prices.\n\nDespite the overall rise in the cost of living and consumers' general restraint in this context, there was no decline in the level of demand for high-quality photo products, which frequently capture emotional moments. In every age group, people are finding it ever more natural to order photo products digitally.\n\n#### Photofinishing market\n\nMore photos have been created than ever before over the past few years. The number of images taken increased significantly, due to mobile devices. While 660 billion photos were taken worldwide in 2013, this number had already increased to 1,200 billion in 2017.**2** In 2023 the figure had reached 1.81 trillion photos. This corresponds to roughly 57,000 photos a second.**3**\n\nSales of smartphones in Germany, which peaked at 26.2 million units in 2015, remain at a high stable level of approx. 22 million units in 2019 and 2020. They remain stable in 2022, with around 22 million units.**2**\n\nThe number of German citizens who own smartphones continues to rise. In 2022, approx. 83 % of over 16 year-olds were smartphone users. The proportion in 2022 corresponds to an overall figure of approx. 57.4 million people.**4**\n\n96 % state that their smartphone makes their everyday life considerably easier. This represents a slight growth rate of one percentage point by comparison with the 2021 figure of 95 %. For 90 % of Germans, their smartphone is so important to them that they cannot imagine doing without it in their everyday lives. This represents an increase of two percentage points by comparison with the 2021 figure of 88 %. At the same time, smartphones are expected to become ever more important in future. Asked about what the future holds in 2030, 91 % of those questioned stated that the role of the smartphone would become even more significant, while 71 % assume that the smartphone will provide even more functions than it currently does.**4**\n\nThis trend is also reflected in the German population's interest in photography: in 2019, 8.67 million people aged 14 years or older in the German-speaking population stated that they were (particularly) interested in photography. In 2021, this figure rose to 8.93 million. In 2022, it amounted to 8.76 million.**5**\n\nA glance at the profile of people interested in photography in 2023 reveals that significantly more than half of photography enthusiasts (approx. 58 %) are in the younger age group of 18 – 39 year-olds. The over-50s also account for a large share (36 %). These figures are unchanged on 2022.

In December the business climate was then at a seasonally-adjusted level of 87.0 points and thus three percentage points lower than in the previous year. Companies in the printing industry had an even gloomier assessment of their business situation. At a level of 81.9 in December this remained clearly (around 7.0 points) below its level in the previous year. With an average index level of 81.8, sentiment in printing and media industry boardrooms thus clearly deteriorated in the final quarter of 2023 and is around 14.3 % lower than the average level for the first quarter. The key factors here were a difficult order situation on account of the state of the economy, the absence of a macroeconomic recovery and ongoing cost pressure which is forcing companies to demand relatively high prices for printing products. The more optimistic assessments of the course of business at the start of the year were thus not reflected in an improvement in companies' business situations over the course of the year.\n\nWhile the procurement market for paper especially stabilised during 2023, the ongoing high cost pressure is nonetheless continuing to have a negative impact on companies' business situations. The depressed order situation is a further factor.\n\nThe rate of employment in the printing industry fell by 3.7 % overall in 2023. However, this varies a great deal, depending on the size of the company in question. For\n\nlarge companies with more than 500 employees, the rate of employment rose significantly, by 9.3 %. This points to the ongoing consolidation of the printing industry.**2**\n\n#### Retail market\n\nCompared with the previous year 2022, average annual retail turnover in 2023 fell in both the EU and the Eurozone by 1.8 %.**3**\n\nIn our view, effective integration of over-the-counter and online business is critical for success. Customers greatly appreciate the ability to pick up products and to try them out, or try them on. In an age of digitalisation, in CEWE's view ever more frequently retail outlets therefore serve as an experience venue and showroom to provide information and inspiration, while their significance as an actual pointof-sale is on the wane. In our view, over-the-counter retail feeds off local frequency and needs to develop this by means of an active product range policy, through which it meets customers' needs while suggesting shopping ideas.\n\nThe trend of rising average prices in the camera segment, which has been apparent over the past few years, continued in 2023. While compact cameras (with a built-in lens) and digital reflex cameras (DSLR) continue to decline in terms of the quantities sold, sales of higher-quality mirrorless system cameras (CSC) remain at a high level. In CEWE's view, specialist photographic retailers are benefitting particularly strongly from this trend, since they are able to provide advice for these models.\n\n→ Economic report\n\nReport 4 Remunerat\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>Results\n\n#### Group profit and loss account\n\n#### **Consolidated profit and loss account** in millions of euros\n\n|                                                                                  |     | 2022   | 2023   | Change<br>in millions<br>of euro |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|----------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                                                         | (1) | 732.7  | 780.2  | 47.5                             |\n| Increase in finished and unfinished goods                                        |     | 0.0    | 0.2    | 0.3                              |\n| Other own work capitalised                                                       | (2) | 2.9    | 4.2    | 1.3                              |\n| Other operating income                                                           | (3) | 29.2   | 25.5   | -3.7                             |\n| Cost of materials                                                                | (4) | -180.5 | -187.4 | -6.8                             |\n| Gross profit                                                                     |     | 584.2  | 622.7  | 38.5                             |\n| Personnel expenses                                                               | (5) | -202.5 | -218.9 | -16.3                            |\n| Other operating expenses                                                         | (6) | -252.8 | -266.1 | -13.3                            |\n| EBITDA                                                                           |     | 128.8  | 137.7  | 8.9                              |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment | (7) | -53.2  | -53.8  | -0.6                             |\n| EBIT                                                                             |     | 75.6   | 83.9   | 8.3                              |\n| Financial income                                                                 | (8) | 0.7    | 6.0    | 5.2                              |\n| Financial expenses                                                               | (8) | -1.5   | -1.9   | -0.4                             |\n| Financial result                                                                 |     | -0.8   | 4.0    | 4.8                              |\n| EBT                                                                              |     | 74.8   | 87.9   | 13.1                             |\n| Income taxes                                                                     | (9) | -23.7  | -28.3  | -4.6                             |\n| Earnings after tax from continuing operations                                    |     | 51.1   | 59.6   | 8.6                              |\n| Post-tax profit/loss for discontinued operation                                  |     | 0.0    | -2.3   | -2.3                             |\n| Group earnings after taxes                                                       |     | 51.1   | 57.3   | 6.2                              |\n| Group earnings per share (in euros)                                              |     |        |        |                                  |\n| Undiluted                                                                        |     | 7.20   | 8.43   | 1.23                             |\n| Diluted                                                                          |     | 7.19   | 8.42   | 1.24                             |\n\n#### **Revenues**\n\nGroup turnover (1) increased by + 6.5 % in the financial year 2023 and totalled 780.2 million euros (previous year: 732.7 million euros). Turnover has risen in the Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing business units. Turnover in the Retail business unit has decreased slightly, which is attributable to currency translation effects. The trend for the Group has been shaped by revenues in Photofinishing in particular, which have increased by 42.7 million euros. The Group revenues achieved are slightly above the upper end of the expected range.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the CEWE Group produced 2.39 billion photos (previous year: 2.28 billion photos). The numbers of units are thus within the predicted range. Moreover, the volume of CEWE PHOTOBOOKS increased in the year under review, at 6.05 million units (previous year: 5.85 million), and is thus even slightly higher than the predicted range.\n\n#### **Change in individual P&L items**\n\nThe significant change in other own work capitalised (2) (+ 1.3 million euros) is attributable, in particular, to the CEWE Photostations which CEWE's subsidiary Hertz Systemtechnik GmbH manufactures.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe cost of materials (4) has also increased, in line with the turnover growth. The material expense ratio has decreased by approx. 0.6 percentage points and amounts\n\nto 23.9 % in the year under review (previous year: 24.5 %).\n\nlower income from the reversal of accruals.\n\nOther operating income (3) has decreased by 3.7 million euros, or 12.6 %, by comparison with the previous year. This trend is largely explicable due to reduced income from recyclable residual materials arising during the production process in the consumables segment as well as\n\nThe CEWE Group's personnel expenses (5) rose moderately year-on-year (16.3 million euros, or 8.1 %) and amount to 218.9 million euros (previous year: 202.5 million euros). On average, the CEWE Group had 3,903 employees in 2023 (previous year: 3,816). This trend mainly reflects collective agreement pay rises as well as lower social security benefits in the form of the short-time allowance.\n\nOther operating expenses (6) likewise increased in the financial year 2023 year-on-year and at 266.1 million euros (previous year: 252.8 million euros) are higher than in the previous year, on business-related grounds. This figure represents 34.1 % of turnover (previous year: 34.5 %).\n\nDepreciation and amortisation (7) have increased by 0.6 million euros year-on-year. This mainly comprises scheduled depreciation and amortisation.\n\nThe financial result (8) has increased year-on-year. While interest expense has increased slightly over the year as a whole (2023: 1.9 million euros; 2022: 1.5 million euros), at 6.0 million euros a significant increase in financial income was achieved in the year under review (2022: 0.7 million euros).\n\nThe Group's tax rate for the reported EBT amounts to 32.2 % for the financial year 2023 and is thus slightly higher than in the previous year (31.7 %). Income taxes (9) have risen slightly and amount to 28.3 million euros in 2023 (previous year: 23.7 million euros).\n\n#### **Earnings trend**\n\nThe Group EBIT figure has increased year-on-year, in line with the development of turnover, by approx. 11.0 %, or 8.3 million euros, to 83.9 million euros (previous year: 75.6 million euros) (cf. the comments on the individual business units, **[page 67](#page-68-0)**). The EBIT figure thus exceeds the forecast range.\n\nIn line with the EBIT figure, the EBT trend was also positive year-on-year and is at 87.9 million euros 17.5 % higher than in the previous year (74.8 million euros) (cf. the comments on the individual business units **[page 67](#page-68-0)**). An EBT figure above the forecast range was thus achieved.\n\nAt EUR 59.6 million euros, in the financial year 2023 the CEWE Group realised earnings after tax from continuing operations which were 8.6 million euros higher (cf. comments on income taxes).\n\n(Undiluted) earnings per share from continuing operations amounted to 8.43 euros and thus exceeded the previous year's level (7.20 euros).\n\nEarnings of the sold subsidiary futalis, which are presented as earnings after taxes of the discontinued operation, amounted to – 2.3 million euros, compared to a balanced 0.0 million euros in the previous year. This includes a posttax operating loss of 1.8 million euros as well as a loss of 0.5 million euros due to this company's removal from the scope of consolidation.\n\nAt EUR 57.3 million euros, in the financial year 2023 the CEWE Group realised earnings after tax which were 6.2 million euros higher and has thus here too exceeded its forecast range.\n\n(Undiluted) earnings per share amounted to 8.10 euros and accordingly exceeded the previous year's level (7.20 euros) and the predicted figure.\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\nlders 3 Combined Manager\n\n→ Economic report\n\n5 **Financial Statements**\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Business units\n\n#### **2023** in millions of euros\n\n|                                | Photofinishing | Retail | Commercial<br>Online Printing | Other<br>Activities | Inter-business-<br>unit turnover1 | CEWE Group |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenues                       | 658.8          | 31.3   | 92.2                          | 0.0                 | -2.0                              | 780.5      |\n| Change on previous year (as %) | 6.9            | -3.4   | 6.6                           |                     |                                   | 6.5        |\n| Change on previous year        | 42.7           | -1.1   | 5.7                           | 0.0                 | 0.2                               | 47.5       |\n| EBIT                           | 80.0           | 0.5    | 4.2                           | -0.8                |                                   | 83.9       |\n| Change on previous year (as %) | 8.6            | 179    | 81.4                          | -37.0               |                                   | 11.0       |\n| Change on previous year        | 6.3            | 0.3    | 1.9                           | -0.2                |                                   | 8.3        |\n| EBIT margin (as %)             | 12.1           | 1.5    | 4.5                           |                     |                                   | 10.8       |\n\n#### **2022** in millions of euros\n\n|                    | Photofinishing | Retail | Commercial<br>Online Printing | Other<br>Activities | Inter-business-<br>unit turnover1 | CEWE Group |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenues           | 616.1          | 32.4   | 86.5                          | 0.0                 | -2.2                              | 732        |\n| EBIT               | 73.7           | 0.2    | 2.3                           | -0.6                |                                   | 75         |\n| EBIT margin (as %) | 12.0           | 0.5    | 2.7                           | -                   |                                   | 10         |\n\n**1** The inter-business-unit turnover relates to the consolidation of turnover between two different business units.\n\n#### Comments on the segments\n\nPhotofinishing includes turnover and earnings from CEWE photo products from own retail activities.\n\nRetail only consists of merchandise business, excl. CEWE's photography products.\n\nOther Activities comprises holding/structural costs (mainly Supervisory Board and IR costs), real estate.\n\n#### **Photofinishing**\n\nRevenues in the Photofinishing business unit increased by 42.7 million euros year-on-year to 658.8 million euros. This corresponds to a turnover increase of 6.9 %. At 80.0 million euros (previous year: 73.7 million euros), the EBIT figure for Photofinishing has made a significant contribution to the Group EBIT figure. This trend mainly reflects the continued increased volume of travel following the coronavirus period, while the inflation-related cost increases have been almost entirely compensated for.\n\n#### **Retail**\n\nRetail turnover has declined year-on-year. Revenues in the year under review amount to 31.3 million euros and are thus 1.1 million euros below those in the previous year. The EBIT figure in the Retail business unit has increased by 0.3 million euros to 0.5 million euros (previous year: 0.2 million euros) and thus improved slightly.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Commercial Online Printing**\n\nRevenues in the Commercial Online Printing business unit have at 92.2 million euros increased considerably by comparison with the previous year (previous year: 86.5 million euros). Things increasingly getting back to normal in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the recovery of business life resulted in a strong level of demand for printed advertising media. The strong turnover trend, together with an optimised cost structure, is also reflected in the earnings volume. The EBIT figure is at 4.2 million euros significantly higher than the previous year's figure of 2.3 million euros.\n\n#### **Other Activities**\n\nIn particular, structural and company costs as well as the result of real estate holdings and equity investments are reflected in the Other Activities business unit.\n\nThe revenues previously reported in the Other Activities business unit related to the discontinued operation futalis and are thus no longer reported there. The EBIT figure in this business unit is – 0.8 million euros and therefore slightly lower than in the previous year (– 0.6 million euros). This is attributable to structural and company costs.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nin millions of euros\n\n**Assets**\n\nTotal assets have increased year-on-year by 5.5 % and amounted to 666.0 million euros at the end of the year (previous year: 632.7 million euros).\n\n#### **Assets**\n\nOn the assets side, this trend primarily reflects an increase in property, plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents. The year-on-year decrease in current trade receivables and receivables from income tax refunds had the opposite effect on the balance sheet total.\n\nDec. 31, 2022 **Dec. 31, 2023** Change in\n\ntion 5 Finan\n\n# 6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-65-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>64</sup>\n\n| Property, plant and equipment               | 224.7 | 233.9 | 9.2   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Investment properties                       | 19.0  | 18.8  | – 0.2 |\n| Goodwill                                    | 81.8  | 81.8  | 0.0   |\n| Intangible assets                           | 24.6  | 21.3  | – 3.2 |\n| Financial assets                            | 9.7   | 6.7   | – 3.0 |\n| Non-current financial assets                | 1.0   | 0.8   | – 0.1 |\n| Non-current other receivables and assets    | 1.8   | 1.8   | 0.0   |\n| Deferred tax assets                         | 13.6  | 14.9  | 1.3   |\n| Non-current assets                          | 376.1 | 380.1 | 4.0   |\n| Inventories                                 | 59.3  | 60.5  | 1.3   |\n| Current trade receivables                   | 98.1  | 91.1  | – 7.0 |\n| Current receivables from income tax refunds | 11.1  | 1.5   | – 9.6 |\n| Current financial assets                    | 3.1   | 3.2   | 0.1   |\n| Other current receivables and assets        | 11.9  | 12.3  | 0.4   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                   | 73.1  | 117.4 | 44.3  |\n| Current assets                              | 256.6 | 285.9 | 29.3  |\n| Assets                                      | 632.7 | 666.0 | 33.3  |\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Economic report\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>65</sup>\n\n5 **Financial Statements** 6\n\nNon-current assets mainly comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, investment properties as well as deferred tax assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by 9.2 million euros year-on-year and amount to 233.9 million euros as of the reporting date. This trend is mainly due to additions which exceeded the volume of scheduled depreciation. Operational investments (outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) in the financial year 2023 amount to 51.7 million euros and are thus lower than envisaged in the forecast.\n\nIntangible assets have decreased by 3.2 million euros, or 13.2 %, on the previous year. They largely consist of customer bases, lists and trademark rights as well as acquired software. In terms of the development of the book values, this is mainly offset by additions in the amount of 8.0 million euros, including scheduled amortisation of 0.7 million euros.\n\nFinancial assets mainly comprise equity investments in venture capital funds and were reduced by 3.0 million euros, or 31.0 %, on the previous year due to the distribution of profits.\n\nOf the deferred tax assets, 6.3 million euros (previous year: 7.2 million euros) relates to loss carry-forwards and 8.6 million euros (previous year: 6.4 million euros) to temporary differences resulting from different valuations under IFRS and tax law rules for pension accruals and property, plant and equipment.\n\nCurrent assets mainly comprise current trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and inventories.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by 44.3 million euros or 60.6 % year-on-year.\n\nAs of the reporting date, current receivables from income tax refunds are 9.6 million euros lower than in the previous year. Tax prepayments were reimbursed on the basis of a tax assessment.\n\nAs of the reporting date, current trade receivables are 7.0 million euros lower than in the previous year. Improved payment methods are a key factor here. In addition, business partners' payment behaviour has a significant influence on the volume of receivables as of the reporting date.\n\nInventories increased by 2.1 %, or 1.3 million euros, in the year under review.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>**Equity and liabilities**\n\nAt the level of equity and liabilities, the increase in the balance sheet total is largely attributable to the positive trend for the CEWE Group's equity. In addition, in the current liabilities item current other liabilities and current tax liabilities have both increased. In the case of noncurrent liabilities, which have hardly changed, the increase in accruals for pensions was offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities from leasing.\n\nEquity increased by 26.5 million euros, or 7.3 %, by comparison with December 31, 2022. This growth is mainly attributable to the 51.5 million euros increase in retained earnings and unappropriated profits, driven by comprehensive income. On the other hand, the opposite effect resulted from the dividend payments made in the year under review in the amount of 17.4 million euros and the share buybacks, which are the main factor behind the 9.0 million euros increase in treasury shares at acquisition cost which are reported as a deduction from equity. The equity ratio at the end of the year was at 58.5 % higher than the previous year's level of 57.3 %, despite the balance sheet increase.\n\nCurrent trade payables rose by 0.9 million euros yearon-year. This is mainly due to the higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter, on account of operating activities as well as investments.\n\nDue to the decrease in the accounting interest rate for the calculation of pension accruals, non-current accruals for pensions have increased by 4.9 million euros or 16.7 % year-on-year.\n\n| Equity and Liabilities                             | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 | Change in<br>millions of euros |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| Subscribed capital                                 | 19.3          | 19.3          | 0.0                            |\n| Capital reserve                                    | 73.8          | 74.0          | 0.2                            |\n| Treasury shares at acquisition cost                | – 26.2        | – 34.1        | – 7.9                          |\n| Retained earnings and unappropriated profits       | 295.9         | 330.0         | 34.1                           |\n| Equity                                             | 362.8         | 389.2         | 26.5                           |\n| Non-current accruals for pensions                  | 29.1          | 34.0          | 4.9                            |\n| Non-current deferred tax liabilities               | 2.1           | 1.6           | – 0.6                          |\n| Non-current other accruals                         | 0.6           | 0.6           | 0.0                            |\n| Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | 0.1           | 0.0           | – 0.1                          |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                      | 40.5          | 37.1          | – 3.4                          |\n| Non-current financial liabilities                  | 0.7           | 0.6           | – 0.1                          |\n| Non-current other liabilities                      | 0.5           | 0.5           | 0.0                            |\n| Non-current liabilities                            | 73.7          | 74.3          | 0.6                            |\n| Current tax liabilities                            | 5.1           | 7.7           | 2.6                            |\n| Current other accruals                             | 2.7           | 3.0           | 0.4                            |\n| Current interest-bearing financial liabilities     | 0.2           | 0.1           | – 0.1                          |\n| Current lease liabilities                          | 9.7           | 9.5           | – 0.2                          |\n| Current trade payables                             | 120.6         | 121.6         | 0.9                            |\n| Current financial liabilities                      | 0.3           | 0.1           | – 0.1                          |\n| Current other liabilities                          | 57.6          | 60.5          | 2.8                            |\n| Current liabilities                                | 196.2         | 202.4         | 6.2                            |\n| Equity and liabilities                             | 632.7         | 666.0         | 33.3                           |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nCash flow\n\nincrease.\n\nHigher value-added tax liabilities at the end of the year and a higher level of wages and salaries yet to be paid out have likewise caused current other liabilities to increase, by 2.8 million euros or 4.9 %.\n\nCurrent tax liabilities increased by 2.6 million euros yearon-year and are thus in line with the positive earnings trend for the Group as a whole.\n\n## Return on capital employed\n\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) is at 18.8 % higher than in the previous year (previous year: 17.6 %). The value of 18.8 % reflects the 12-month EBIT figure of 83.9 million euros and the average volume of capital employed of 445.9 million euros over the four quarterly reporting dates in 2023. This development is attributable to the parallel increase in the 12-month EBIT figure and average capital employed.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023, the CEWE Group achieved a positive cash flow from operating activities in the amount of 130.8 million euros (previous year: 93.4 million euros). Its cash flow is thus 37.4 million euros higher than in the previous year, which represents a significant\n\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities reflects several different factors. An 8.9 million euros effect is attributable to the EBITDA figure and has thus arisen due to the general course of business. A further 17.2 million euros has been induced by operating working capital and\n\nother working capital, where a decrease in trade receivables in the year under review in particular contrasts with an increase in the previous year. In the year under review 2023, net tax payments were 10.9 million euros lower than in the previous year.\n\nAt 47.9 million euros, cash outflows from investing activities in the year under review 2023 are clearly (14.0 million euros) lower than in the previous year. While in the previous year the purchase of an administrative building (9.3 million euros) and the acquisition payments (7.7 million euros) led to increased cash outflows, conversely inflows from financial investments resulted in the year under review (5.4 million euros). Operational investments adjusted for business and company acquisitions are 2.7 million euros higher than in the previous year.\n\nOverall, at 82.8 million euros free cash flow has strongly increased by comparison with the previous year (31.5 million euros), for the reasons set out above.\n\n#### **Condensed cash flow statement** in millions of euros\n\n|                                                                | 2022  | 2023  | Change<br>in millions<br>of euros |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities                            | 93.4  | 130.8 | +37.4                             |\n| Cash flow from investing activities                            | -61.9 | -47.9 | +14.0                             |\n| Free cash flow                                                 | 31.5  | 82.8  | +51.4                             |\n| Cash flow from financing activities                            | -42.6 | -38.9 | +3.7                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the reporting period | 84.4  | 73.1  | -11.3                             |\n| Net change in cash and cash equivalents                        | -11.1 | 43.9  | +55.1                             |\n| Exchange-rate-related change in cash and cash equivalents      | -0.2  | 0.4   | +0.5                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period   | 73.1  | 117.4 | +44.3                             |\n\nMoreover, cash outflows from financing activities decreased slightly and amounted to 38.9 million euros, compared to 42.6 million euros in the previous year. In the year under review 2023, in particular the dividend paid in the amount of 17.3 million euros (previous year: 16.6 million euros), the acquisition of treasury shares in the amount of 9.0 million euros (previous year: 13.7 million euros) and the outflows resulting from the change in financial liabilities in the amount of 12.1 million euros (previous year: 11.5 million euros) resulted in cash outflows.\n\nWith its available financial resources, CEWE was able at all times to fulfil its liquidity requirements which arose over the course of the year due to the seasonal nature of its business, as usual.

CEWE achieves a stronger level of value creation with these value-added products, which consumers purchase from various business partners and also directly from CEWE. The company's preparations for its Christmas business over the course of the first ten months of each year entail very high \"outlays\". Here too, CEWE thus has the opportunity to realise a slightly increased margin. CEWE sees the use of smartphones as\n\na fully-fledged camera plus an ordering device as representing an opportunity, and every part of the company is adapting to this trend.\n\nAs outlined in the description of the related business model, Retail plays a key role in this trend, but not primarily in the photographic hardware business (whose development is reported in the Retail business unit). Its locations increasingly serve as a distribution channel for photofinishing products (which are reported in the Photofinishing business unit) – here too, directly to consumers. This is reflected in the rising level of turnover involving photofinishing products which are sold via the Retail business unit, through CEWE's online stores or its branches.\n\nCommercial Online Printing is CEWE's third business unit. In CEWE's view, thanks to highly automated and highly efficient production at SAXOPRINT in Dresden, CEWE has a good chance of further success in this market.\n\nAt the start of 2024, CEWE's business development continued to match the Board of Management's expectations. All in all, this has strengthened the Board of Management's resolve in terms of the targets which it has indicated for the financial year 2024 in the \"Report on expected developments\" chapter **[see Report on expected developments,](#page-73-0)  [pages 72 ff](#page-73-0)**.\n\n# Events after the balance sheet date\n\n## Events of particular significance after the balance sheet date\n\nThe potential effects of the continued inflation and the related impact on CEWE's course of business have been factored into the forecast, opportunities and risk report on the basis of the information currently available.\n\nIn order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 CEWE's subsidiary SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden, via an asset deal. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. No other events of particular significance have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk report\n\n**opportunities**\n\nfication are also documented. Corresponding measures are likewise taken into consideration for risk assessment purposes. A net risk assessment is thus also implemented. The German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) which was revised in the summer of 2022 places a particularly strong emphasis on sustainable corporate governance.\n\nTaking opportunities and the ability to identify and analyse risks and to reduce, avoid or transfer them via suitable strategies are key aspects of CEWE's corporate activities. The Board of Management is continuously tasked with systematic management of risks and opportunities. This is a management task in each of its areas of responsibility.\n\n**Management's overall assessment of risks and** \n\nRisks and opportunities are regularly separately identified and outlined. They are assessed quantitatively together with an evaluation of their impact. The impact and the assumed probability of realisation are combined to produce the expected risk score. The related measures are registered for the purpose of risk management; finally, the indicators implemented for the purpose of early identi-\n\nSustainability refers here to environmental (ecological) and social goals. This means that these goals must be an integral part of strategies, planning and operational processes. They are thus likewise an integral component of the risk management system, the compliance management system and the internal control system. CEWE is committed to these goals.\n\nA major event may mean that the effects of individual risks are amplified through their combination or interaction with one another or else these risks' impact upon one another. During the coronavirus pandemic, CEWE gave particular consideration to this in its risk assessment and evaluation. The specific coronavirus risk once again significantly decreased year-on-year, in line with the evolution of the pandemic. It is currently considered in the context of a more broadly defined pandemic risk.\n\nThe Board of Management's regular risk assessment within the scope of the risk management process and the risk inventory as of December 31, 2023 has established that individual risks – or risks arising in conjunction with others – do not point to any impairment of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the CEWE Group in a manner which would jeopardise its existence.\n\nIrrespective of their economic significance, multi-layered risks associated with sustainability requirements, cyber risks, risks associated with the high pace and density of regulation and risks relating to an adequate supply of qualified specialists and executives are a priority for CEWE. This represents a particularly strong area of its management activities.\n\nIn particular, cyber risk, staff turnover risk, the risks associated with technical infrastructure and, in the field of legal risks, risk associated with the high density and pace of regulation were given a higher priority than in the previous year.\n\nCEWE continues to expect that the Ukraine conflict will not have any direct impact on its business, either in terms of procurement or sales. At the present time, there are still no indications of any negative influence on consumer sentiment and thus on the development of turnover.\n\nThe following section initially sets out the key risk categories within the scope of its risk management system:\n\n#### **Strategic risks**\n\nThe core business units of Photofinishing, Commercial Online Printing and Retail entail strategic risks.\n\nIn our core business, the key strategic risks comprise the technology and innovation risk, the risks associated with the CEWE brand and the risk relating to the development of the mobile photofinishing market. In response to the change associated with mobile devices and the key importance of the Internet as an ordering channel, CEWE has reinforced its programming and development capacities in this area. The technology and innovation risk is countered above all via strategic partnerships with research institutions, regular market analyses and monitoring of the competitive environment. Consumer-oriented brand communication, continuous brand reinforcement and effective and efficient crisis management limit the potential risks associated with the CEWE brand.\n\nForecast, opportunities and risk report\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\ntion E.

Consistent price controlling plays a key role in all of CEWE's activities in relation to price risk.\n\nAs a rule, the technical infrastructure is safeguarded by means of IT structures standardised throughout the Group, high-availability technologies, back-up data centres as well as back-up connections for the transmission of data. Virus and access protection as well as encryption systems are important technologies which protect against unauthorised external and internal access. Production capacities are likewise safeguarded through redundant processes at various locations. The possibility of central management of capacities also plays a key role. We are certainly aware of the general risk associated with the supply and procurement of materials, but do not consider this to be particularly significant. In all procurement lines, a multiple-supplier strategy and multiple-year contracts are considered to be adequate measures.\n\nCyber risks are significant for CEWE's business model and have a particularly strong weighting. This mainly relates to general attacks on vulnerabilities in the software products which CEWE uses, hacker attacks specifically targeting CEWE as well as attacks on the data links between CEWE and its customers. CEWE is continuously working on technical and organisational improvements within the scope of its IT systems in order to tackle these risks. It is continuing to increase its volume of personnel in the area of IT security, improving existing contingency plans on an\n\nongoing basis and embedding these in other contingency plans. Finally, awareness-raising and training play an important role within the company as a whole.\n\nIn the area of environmental risk, no violations of environmental standards were identified in 2023. This risk is monitored by means of regular internal checks at all of the company's production plants; it is classified as low.\n\nThe risk associated with recruiting and retaining qualified specialists and executives is more significant indirectly rather than directly. The presence of the CEWE umbrella brand also plays an important role in the labour market here. Closely supported by the company's management, initial and advanced training are consistently offered and cover employees' specialist fields as well as personal and leadership skills. The management focuses particularly strongly on retention of staff.\n\n#### **Financial risks**\n\nThe risks resulting from interest rate changes, currency fluctuations, the supply of credit, the risk associated with the resale of recyclable residual materials arising during the production process and the risk of default fall within the scope of CEWE's financial risks and do not jeopardise its existence. Due to the low level of interest-bearing debt funding and the high volume of cash and cash equivalents resulting from the seasonal business trend, even a strong rise in market interest rates would not represent a threat. Where capital flows occur outside of the Eurozone, they almost entirely relate to local business which is handled in the same currency, so that exchange-rate fluctuations do not have any significant negative impact. The CEWE Group's long-term supply of credit is safeguarded\n\nby means of centrally negotiated medium- to long-term credit agreements.\n\nThe risk of default is continuing to decline in significance due to the constant growth in the volume of consumer business too. Receivables from business partners are closely monitored and are subject to normal and adequate insurance arrangements. Consumer receivables do not in themselves constitute a risk and are covered by a professional debt collection management system.\n\nOther receivables apply in relation to the public sector, employees and insurance firms etc. Here too, the risk of potential loss-related impairment is of minor significance. This risk is reduced by means of continuous monitoring of debtors' credit ratings and payment behaviour, in close coordination with all of the company's affected departments. Any applicable individual risks are always taken into consideration by means of adequate valuation adjustments, insofar as the realisation of this loss is sufficiently probable.\n\n#### **Legal risks**\n\nLegal risks include internal and external malicious acts as well as risks associated with data protection and industrial property rights. These risks are covered by means of measures and processes within the scope of the company's rigorous corporate governance system, its internal control system, internal auditing as well as its Group controlling function. The company is aware of the challenges associated with the high density and pace of regulation, monitors these issues in detail and pursues an effective management strategy in order to actively counter these risks. In addition, information and training sessions are regularly held in order to identify risks and implement measures.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\nent Report 4 Remunera\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>71</sup>\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, the BEPS Pillar 2 rules (German Act Transposing the Minimum Tax Directive, Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – MinBestRL-UmsG) were transposed into German law (German Act on Minimum Taxation, Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG) and entered into force upon publication in the German Federal Law Gazette on December 27, 2023. The provisions of the Act on Minimum Taxation apply for the first time for financial years beginning after December 30, 2023 and are therefore not yet applicable for the year under review. Even if these provisions had already been applicable, the CEWE Group would not have fallen under the scope of the Min-StG or foreign acts on minimum taxation either in the year under review or in the financial year 2024, since the turnover threshold of 750 million euros in the consolidated financial statements for application of these provisions was exceeded for the first time in the year under review. This notwithstanding, CEWE expects to once again exceed the relevant turnover threshold in the financial year 2024 and thus assumes that the provisions of the MinStG will apply for the first time for the financial year 2025.\n\nIn the financial year 2024, the CEWE Group will therefore commence a project reviewing the impact in terms of the effects associated with a Pillar 2 top-up tax. It is not currently possible to quantity the potential additional tax burden. However, application of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation are not currently expected to lead to a significant additional tax burden, since the CEWE Group operates almost exclusively in countries whose nominal income tax burden exceeds 15 % and for which no tax burden at all, or only an insignificant tax burden, is therefore expected to arise.\n\nThe CEWE Group is closely monitoring the progress of the legislative process in every country where it operates. It will adapt its current reporting and compliance processes with a view to future local and central determination of the top-up tax burden as well as the future submission of a minimum tax report and filing of related tax returns in Germany and other countries.\n\n#### Report on opportunities\n\nThe CEWE Group's risks and opportunities management systems are closely integrated. Possible future developments or events which may result in a positive deviation from planning are seen as opportunities.\n\nWith its business units, CEWE operates in dynamic market segments which are enjoying rapid growth. Exploiting opportunities in these business units by means of innovation, consolidation or organic growth and identifying further opportunities in adjacent and related new business units while avoiding unnecessary risks serve as the foundations of the CEWE Group's long-term growth. Opportunities may entail both internal and external potential.\n\nOpportunities whose realisation is probable have been factored into CEWE's corporate planning and outlook for 2024. This report on opportunities therefore relates to events which may potentially give rise to a positive deviation from these planning figures.\n\nCEWE sees management of opportunities as a core aspect of its corporate activities. Identifying, weighing up and\n\nseizing opportunities is a key and ongoing management task. Management of opportunities thus includes documentation of concepts and minutes of meetings.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Photofinishing business unit**\n\nCEWE sees opportunities in terms of increased income due to the additional turnover provided by new or improved ordering applications for mobile devices, should these gain even stronger acceptance among end-consumers.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Commercial Online Printing business unit**\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, in its Commercial Online Printing business unit CEWE focused even more strongly on the efficiency of its customer-related processes and its cost structures. Following the end of the coronavirus pandemic and the winding-down of governments' coronavirus measures, to some extent general business life has already recovered and the level of demand for business stationery and printed advertising media thus strengthened. This offers further opportunities to achieve turnover and income beyond the scope of the current planning, particularly in the context of long-term cost efficiency.\n\n#### **Opportunities in the Retail business unit**\n\nCEWE operates photo retail stores through its own Retail operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In principle, it aims to further optimise its Retail presence through its own stores on the market, in line with end-consumers' purchasing behaviour. In Norway, Sweden and Poland, CEWE has established online stores for photography-related articles. Optimisation of these stores is expected to generate opportunities for further turnover increases and income in the online segment.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nCEWE at a Glance\n\nrisk report\n\ngement Report 4 Remune\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n<span id=\"page-73-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>72</sup>\n\n## Report on expected developments\n\n#### **Three different components of long-term business development**\n\nCEWE is continuing to pursue the ongoing development of the CEWE Group on the basis of the following three strategic priorities:\n\n#### (1) Strengthening the company's brand and innovation leadership in its Photofinishing core business unit\n\nIn its Photofinishing business unit, in addition to its core markets of Germany, Switzerland and Austria as an omnichannel provider CEWE continues to focus on expanding its brands positioned in the premium segment in all of the other European countries supplied by CEWE. The goal is to exploit the positive consumer response and strong brand profile for the benefit of CEWE in general. The product differentiation advantages that are associated with the performance and quality standards which these brands stand for will be progressively exploited for a growing product portfolio. Besides the CEWE brand, the other brands of the CEWE Group – in particular, Cheerz, DeinDesign, Pixum and WhiteWall – address specific customer groups and/or regions or offer specific product categories.\n\nCEWE's products and services undergo continuous development. Innovations already served as the key source of momentum in the analogue/digital transformation. The company endeavours to keep up this innovation momentum, in all of its business units, in order to further consolidate\n\n**1** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff. **2** IMF: World Economic Outlook, Update Jan 2024, p. 1 ff. **3** Deutsche Bundesbank Monthly Report 1/2024: p. 5\n\nits leading market position. For example, this includes extensive software updates, the ongoing development of mobile applications and various new products and product improvements.\n\n#### (2) Profitable growth in Commercial Online Printing\n\nAt CEWE, Commercial Online Printing offers the customer a series of advantages: increased quality and price advantages from state-of-the-art printing capacities, and also time savings thanks to user-friendly Internet ordering as well as fast production and rapid delivery. CEWE considers itself very well placed here in order to achieve the successful ongoing development of its Commercial Online Printing business unit, particularly thanks to what is, in the Board of Management's view, SAXOPRINT's highly-efficient and cost-optimised printing plant in Dresden.\n\n#### (3) Development of business units\n\nAbove all, when it comes to potential investment opportunities the CEWE Group is particularly interested in online business models which – just like CEWE – produce customised, high-quality products with a substantial customer benefit and thus build a strong brand, while offering the potential of further developing the CEWE Group's business in future. Growth encompassing new fields of business should thus ideally draw upon the Group's existing areas of expertise.\n\n#### **Continuing focus on Europe**\n\nAlmost all of CEWE's business is located in Europe. At the present time, the company is not planning any changes in its regional presence.\n\n#### **Overall economic environment in 2024: global economic growth slower than average in period since 2000**\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a 3.1 % rate of global growth in 2024 and 3.2 % in 2025. However, the expected pace of growth is lower than the 3.8 % historical growth rates seen in the period from 2000 to 2019. In the IMF's view, this is due to the central banks' increased key interest rates to combat inflation, reduced fiscal support in view of the high level of debt and weak underlying productivity growth. In the developed economies, at 1.5 % in 2024 and 1.8 % in 2025 the pace of growth will be significantly lower than global growth momentum. In the IMF's assessment, the Eurozone will grow even more slowly: following a rate of 0.5 % in 2023, it will grow by 0.9 % in 2024 and by 1.7 % in 2025. According to the IMF, this reflects increased household consumer spending, falling energy prices, lower inflation levels and real income growth. For Germany, the IMF predicts growth of 0.5 % (2024) and 1.6 % (2025).**1**\n\nInflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, since the supply-side problems are resolving themselves and monetary policy is likely to be less restrictive. In the IMF's view, aggregate global inflation will fall from 6.8 % in 2023 to 5.8 % in 2024 and 4.4 % in 2025.**2**\n\n#### **Assessment of CEWE's management regarding the overall economic conditions in 2024**\n\nIn 2023 CEWE remained resilient despite the weak economic environment in Germany, with a – 0.3 % fall in its gross domestic product.**3** As in 2022, in the year under review\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nt Report 4 Remuneratio\n\nformation\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\nCEWE was able to compensate for inflation by means of price increases. Contrary to consumer sentiment which generally stagnated, demand for individual, high-quality photo products continued to increase. The management is confident that its core Photofinishing business unit will continue to develop positively in 2024. High-quality photo products which in many cases reflect emotional moments appear to be among the products which consumers are not prepared to do without, despite generally somewhat weak consumer sentiment. Thanks to CEWE PHOTOBOOK and its other brand products and its strong Internet expertise, as in previous years CEWE considers itself well placed to actively promote this process of ongoing change in its product mix, away from simple photo prints to value-added products such as photo books, photo calendars, wall art, greeting cards and other photo gifts. The upshot of this is that this trend of value-added products should continue to strengthen Photofinishing in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, the Retail business unit is expected to once again provide a significant turnover contribution through sales of CEWE photo products. Turnover and earnings for these photofinishing products – which CEWE distributes through its own retail operations – are reported in the Photofinishing business unit. In 2024, as it has done for some years now CEWE will in all likelihood continue to deliberately reduce the hardware turnover which is reported in the Retail business unit and which comprises cameras, lenses, photo equipment etc.\n\nWith its highly efficient automated production system which realises large economies of scale, the Board of Management considers that Commercial Online Printing is well prepared for the financial year 2024. This business unit is expected to continue to develop positively in 2024. The company's best-price strategy for business customers is clearly paying off in terms of growing customer confidence and thus increased loyalty.\n\n#### **Compensating for inflation will remain a goal in 2024**\n\nIn the past two years, CEWE has succeeded in balancing the inflation-driven cost increases on the expense side with its own price increases on the turnover/income side, thus compensating absolutely for the former. In 2024, CEWE will continuously analyse the inflation trend and thus the increased cost burden which this represents for the company and will seek to offset this as far as possible through price adjustments implemented in a cautious and balanced manner.\n\n#### **Solid financial position provides scope for action**\n\nWe envisage that in 2024 CEWE's operational strength will continue to enable it to fund investments in organic growth and its annual dividend payment out of its operating cash flow alone.\n\n#### **War in Ukraine still not expected to affect CEWE**\n\nTo date, the war in Ukraine has not had any direct impact on CEWE's business, either in terms of procurement or sales. At the present time, there are still no indications of any negative impact on consumer sentiment and thus on the development of turnover. However, CEWE's planning for 2024 does not reflect the possible effects of a potential escalation of the Ukraine war – above all, on consumer sentiment.\n\n**EBIT earnings target range in 2024: 77 to 87 million euros** On average, Group turnover will continue to increase in 2024, from 780.2 million euros in the previous year, 2023, to between 770 million euros and 820 million euros. In 2024, Group EBIT will fall within a range of between 77 million euros and 87 million euros, the EBT figure will amount to between 75.5 million euros and 85.5 million euros, while earnings after tax will lie within a range of 51 million euros to 58 million euros.\n\nThe ranges for these targets for the financial year 2024 represent approximate projected figures and reflect the current uncertainties associated with the increase in prices/inflation from the point of view of costs, and the cost of sales, and their potential impact on CEWE's course of business. In its operational planning for 2024, the Board of Management aims to achieve a target in the upper half of the envisaged range.\n\nThe operational investments planned for 2024 (i.e. outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excluding business and company acquisitions) are expected to be around 65 million euros or less.\n\n#### **Goal is for continuous further dividend growth as far as possible**\n\nCEWE considers itself an extremely reliable dividend payer. The dividend proposed for 2023 represents a 15th consecutive increase. In general, CEWE pursues the goal of dividend continuity. Where this appears possible in view of the company's economic situation and the available investment opportunities, this means a dividend which is at least unchanged in absolute terms, and ideally an increased dividend. This policy clearly focuses on the absolute dividend value, with the payout ratio or the dividend yield as a secondary element.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration\n\n→ Forecast, opportunities and risk report\n\n#### **Targets for 2024 CEWE Group**\n\n|                             |                   | 2024         | Change as % |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Photos                      | billion units     | 2.3 to 2.4   | -2 to +     |\n| CEWE PHOTOBOOK              | million units     | 5.9 to 6.2   | -2 to +     |\n| Operational investments 1   | millions of euros | ~65          |             |\n| Turnover                    | millions of euros | 770 to 820   | -1 to +     |\n| EBIT                        | millions of euros | 77 to 87     | -8 to +     |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT) | millions of euros | 75.5 to 85.5 | -14 to -    |\n| Earnings after taxes        | millions of euros | 51 to 58     | - 10 to +   |\n| Earnings per share          | euros/share       | 7.26 to 8.22 | - 10 to +   |\n\n**1** Outflows from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; excl. business and company acquisitions\n\n*In this annual report, CEWE is publishing a combined management report for the CEWE Group and for the individual company CEWE Stiftung & Co.

Fin\n\n6 Further Information\n\n## Internal control and risk management system\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe company strongly emphasises compliance in terms of measures to ensure conformity with applicable legislation and internal policies and their observance by the Group's companies. The Board of Management of the general partner has implemented various mechanisms in line with its responsibilities in this respect, which are intended to ensure optimal fulfilment of these compliance requirements.\n\nThe Compliance Officer appointed for this issue continuously addresses the maintenance and development of the compliance structure of the company and the Group, in line with applicable requirements and the needs of the company. In particular, his activities focus on training for employees and on legal risk management. He reports to the CEO of the general partner. In case of any specific issues, the Compliance Officer will consult the persons with responsibility in the company's respective divisions and obtain external legal advice, where necessary.\n\nThe company has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudsman. Employees and also third parties may contact this person to point out possible violations of the law or policy violations within Group companies. Four reports were filed with the ombudsman in the reporting period. These were investigated. However, no relevant violations were determined.\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code (\"GCGC\") requires disclosures concerning internal control and risk management which exceed the statutory requirements for a management report and have thus been excluded from the auditor's audit of the management report (\"non-management report disclosures\"). These are included as part of the management declaration; moreover, they are set apart by means of separate paragraphs from the disclosures which are to be audited.\n\n#### Risk management system\n\n#### **Goals and strategy of the risk management system**\n\nAs an internationally operative business group, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks which may adversely affect their business activities as well as their net assets, financial position and results of operations. Accordingly, in compliance with industry standards and statutory provisions CEWE has established an internal control and risk management system for identification and assessment of potential opportunities and risks and, where necessary, implementation of appropriate countermeasures. This control and risk management system is incorporated within the information and communication system of the CEWE Group as an integral part of its business, planning, accounting and control processes and is a key element of the CEWE\n\nGroup's management system. Its control and risk management system is based on a systematic risk identification, assessment and management process for the overall Group. CEWE is continuously improving its risk management system. That includes its ongoing dovetailing with the company's internal control system and other management systems.\n\nAs a function which identifies risks at an early stage, monitors them on an ongoing basis and contributes to risk control, risk management forms part of the second line of CEWE's integrated governance, risk and compliance approach.\n\n#### **Organisation and structure of the risk management system**\n\nThe Board of Management, the managers of the company's regional profit centres in Germany and other countries and its central departments and project managers are responsible for its control and risk management system. The Board of Management has overall responsibility for the handling of control and risk management. From a functional point of view, the Board of Management has transferred to the Group's risk management personnel operational implementation of monitoring, coordination and ongoing development tasks within the scope of risk management processes.\n\nThe risk management system covers the risks and opportunities associated with the individual risk areas, within the scope of an annual, Group-wide risk inventory. The\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remur\n\n→ Internal control and risk management system\n\nannual report on risks and opportunities has been produced on the basis of the risk inventory. In the course of a year, the company's risk and opportunity assessments are reviewed at least quarterly. The Supervisory Board is notified of these assessments at least quarterly. Following notification of the risk officer, new risks and opportunities are incorporated in the risk management system and assigned to a risk manager. In addition to the regular processes, ad hoc risks can be registered and reported at any time where situations suddenly arise. Corresponding measures are likewise taken into consideration for risk assessment purposes. A net risk assessment is thus also implemented.\n\n#### **Key features of the internal control system**\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) is an integral component of the business processes of the CEWE Group. The goal is for all operating units where risks may arise and must be managed to be able to identify such risks at an early stage through internal controls and to deal with them. This system is intended to ensure compliance with external and internal requirements. The internal control system thus represents the first line of the integrated management approach. It encompasses a variety of different monitoring and control mechanisms and is essentially based on five principles:\n\n- Dual-control principle\n- Signature guidelines\n- IT authorisation concept\n- Separation of functions\n- Integrated reporting\n\nThe dual-control principle is safeguarded by means of rules and regulations such as articles of association, policies, rules of procedure, instructions and powers of representation and authorisations to sign. The operationally effective signature guidelines are an important aspect of these rules and regulations. The CEWE Group's coordinated IT authorisation concept is a further management and control mechanism. This regulates the activities of individual persons and groups of persons and their access to the Group's generally SAP-based applications and their functional competences.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of procedures and thus the quality of individual processes, the CEWE Group maintains a strict separation of functions for critical business processes. In addition, specific departments handle central tasks and thus have reciprocal responsibility for supervision of the Group's activities. The integrated reporting system comprises a detailed planning, management and reporting concept covering the Group's current position and its outlook. The planning process is based on a combined bottom-up and top-down approach, in line with monthly planned figures. The existing Group information system relies on a monthly target/actual/prior-year comparison as well as supplementary multiple-location business reviews at the level of the individual profit centres and at Group level. Developments, risks, opportunities and measures are discussed there and documented accordingly.\n\nThe CEWE Group also monitors the fair value of its interests in subsidiaries within the scope of its control and risk management system. Its shareholdings undergo regular as well as ad hoc impairment tests.\n\nMoreover, as the third line of our integrated management approach all of the Group's companies and profit centres regularly undergo specialised, in-depth audits covering the areas of finance and accounting, IT, technical security and insurance policies as well as other functional competences. These audits are carried out by external or internal specialists.\n\n#### **Key aspects of the internal control system, in relation to the Group accounting process**\n\nThe accounting-related internal control system is embedded within the company-wide risk management system, as a component of the overall internal control system (ICS) of the CEWE Group. Its purpose is to minimise the risk of a material misstatement in the company's accounting and external reporting, to identify undesirable developments early on and to implement countermeasures. This ensures that the Group's affairs are presented in compliance with applicable legislation and standards in separate financial statements and in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuner\n\n→ Internal control and risk management system\n\nThe \"Group balance sheets\" unit, central Finance division, is responsible for preparing the consolidated financial statements including any consolidation measures. The preparation process for the financial statements of the CEWE Group is based on a uniform Group accounting policy which is regularly adjusted in line with applicable legal outline conditions. The Board of Management has sole responsibility in relation to this accounting policy.\n\nThe Group's accounting policy sets out its IFRS accounting standards for all of the Group's companies, in Germany and in other countries, to ensure the application of uniform recognition, measurement and reporting methods for its IFRS consolidated financial statements. Binding instructions have been laid down in relation to internal reconciliations and other tasks for preparation of the financial statements. All key dates have been specified throughout the Group in the Group's policy.\n\nThe local companies are responsible for compliance with the relevant rules and are supported and monitored by the Group Accounting unit. The Group Accounting unit handles consolidation of the separate financial statements of the Group companies – which are mainly prepared using SAP – centrally by means of a specific consolidation module.\n\nThe necessary work steps within the scope of the accounting process undergo a large number of automatic and manual checks and plausibility reviews. In addition, the effectiveness of accounting-related internal checks is continuously monitored through internal auditing. This task is handled by internal auditors as well as external auditors appointed by the company. A rolling process ensures that all of the companies within the scope of consolidation undergo this supervisory process. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are regularly notified of the results of these effectiveness reviews.\n\nThe separate financial statements included within the consolidated financial statements are audited by various local auditors. Compliance with applicable accounting rules and regulations and the accuracy and completeness of all other locally produced documents which are relevant for the consolidated financial statements are thus safeguarded. The external auditor of the consolidated financial statements summarises audit findings at the level of the separate financial statements and the consolidated financial statements regarding the effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system of the CEWE Group and notifies the Supervisory Board accordingly.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Acquisition-related disclosures\n\ngement Report 4 RE\n\n# <span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>Acquisition-related disclosures\n\n## Disclosures in accordance with § 289a and 315a HGB\n\n#### **Composition of subscribed capital, restrictions relating to voting rights or the transfer of shares**\n\nThe subscribed capital of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA, Oldenburg, as far as the company is aware no specific requirements apply in relation to the possibility of their exercise of voting rights. Employees are not known to have any joint holdings of one or more shares (§ 69 (1) AktG), and nor are any voting trust agreements between employee shareholders known of.\n\n#### **Statutory regulations and provisions in the company's articles of association regarding the appointment and removal from office of members of the Board of Management and amendments of the articles of association**\n\nThe company's general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, Oldenburg, is authorised to manage the affairs of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and to represent it (§ 8 of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA). Unless imperatively stipulated in the articles of association or by law, the legal relationships between the company and its general partner will be regulated in a separate agreement; the company shall be represented\n\nby the Supervisory Board in this respect. § 9 of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA provides for the withdrawal of the company's general partner. Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung thus assumes this role irrespective of any capital contribution; but the imperative statutory grounds for the withdrawal of the general partner remain unaffected (§ 9 (1) of the articles of association). It will not be entitled to any credit balance in case of partition in the event of its withdrawal (§9 (2) of the articles of association). In the event of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung's withdrawal from its position as the company's general partner or if its withdrawal is foreseeable, to prevent the liquidation of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, § 9 (3) includes the following provision: the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is entitled and obliged immediately/as of this withdrawal to appoint a company limited by shares – which are held in their entirety by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA – as the new general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA with a sole authorisation for management of its business and a sole power of representation (clause 1). Should Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung withdraw from its position as the company's general partner without the simultaneous appointment of a new general partner, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's limited shareholders will assume the continuing management of the company on a temporary basis (clause 2). In this case, the Supervisory Board shall\n\nimmediately apply to the competent court for the appointment of a substitute representative to represent the company up to the appointment of a new general partner, particularly in the event that CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA need first acquire or establish a company limited by shares to serve as its general partner (clause 3). The Supervisory Board is authorised to adjust the wording of the articles of association in accordance with the replacement of the company's general partner (clause 4).\n\nNeumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung is represented by its Board of Management in and out of court. Its Board of Management is thus also responsible for the management of the business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. The members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung are appointed by the Board of Trustees. A member of the Board of Management may be appointed by the beneficiaries of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung designated in its articles of association. The members of the Board of Management will be appointed for a term of office of up to five years. The Board of Trustees shall rule on any issues pertaining to service regulations.\n\nThe relevant statutory provisions (§§ 179 ff., 285 (2) and 181 AktG) apply in relation to any changes to the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Acquisition-related disclosures\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n#### **Powers of the Board of Management to issue and to repurchase shares**\n\nThe general meeting held on May 31, 2017 had authorised the buyback of treasury shares for up to 10 % of the share capital as of the date of this resolution, in the period up to May 30, 2022. At the general meeting held on June 15, 2022, this authorisation was renewed for the period up to the expiry of June 14, 2027. This authorisation was granted\n\n- in order to resell the shares over the stock exchange or by means of an offer submitted to all of the shareholders, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and while complying with the principle of equal treatment (§ 53a AktG).\n- the retirement of the shares, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, with the consent of the Supervisory Board. The fact or the procedure of these shares' retirement will not require a further resolution to be passed by the general meeting. These shares may therefore be called in through simplified procedures, without any capital reduction, by adjusting the pro rata notional value of the other no-par value shares in the company's share capital.\n- to dispose of the shares, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, in return for a payment in kind; in particular, these shares may be offered or granted to third parties within the scope of company mergers or at the acquisition of companies.\n- to offer the shares for purchase to employees of the company or its affiliates within the meaning of §§ 15 ff. AktG, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, or to promise these shares or transfer them with a lockup period of not less than one year; the treasury shares may also be promised and transferred to eligible persons in fulfilment of dividend claims arising from shares of the company;\n- with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to offer the shares for purchase to employees including the members of the Board of Management and the management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung within the scope of a stock option plan. In this case, the waiting period is four years. The Supervisory Board will specify the details of share-based remuneration for the members of the Board of Management;\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the general partner is authorised to grant purchased treasury shares to members of the Board of Management of the general partner as a variable remuneration component.\n\n#### **Material agreements which are subject to a change of control due to a takeover offer**\n\nThe financing agreements concluded with the company's key bank partners include the usual change-of-control provisions; these may entail the need for the amendment, supplementation or revision of the existing credit agreements. Otherwise, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, does not have any agreements with third parties which are subject to a change of control due to a takeover offer and which may have the following effects, either individually or in their totality.\n\n#### **Compensation agreements**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, does not have any agreements which have been concluded with members of the Board of Management or the management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung or employees, to cover the event of a takeover offer and which may lead to an obligation for the company to provide compensation or other payments.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nmillion euros to 113.3 million euros (previous year: 105.5 million euros). The personnel expense ratio amounted to\n\nAnnual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\n→ Annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\nResults of operations, asset and financial position\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nThe operating business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is only one part of the business activities of the overall CEWE Group. The following paragraphs only refer to the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\nRevenues increased by 26.4 million euros to 401.9 million euros in the financial year 2023. This was mainly due to higher turnover in the Photofinishing business unit in Germany. The development of turnover year-on-year is attributable to both price and volume effects.\n\nOther operating income decreased by 0.7 million euros, from 7.9 million euros in the previous year to 7.2 million euros. This corresponds to 1.8 % of turnover (previous year: 2.1 %), due to lower income from the reversal of accruals and valuation adjustments on receivables.\n\nThe material expense ratio declined slightly, by 0.4 percentage points to 24.8 % (previous year: 25.2 %). In absolute terms, the cost of materials has increased to 99.6 million euros (previous year: 49.6 million euros), analogously to the turnover growth.\n\nAccordingly, personnel expenses also increased, by 7.8\n\n28.2 %, an increase of just 0.1 percentage points (previous year: 28.1 %). This growth is mainly attributable to collective agreement pay rises as well as an increase in the workforce.\n\nDue to investments, depreciation and amortisation have decreased by 2.7 million euros on the previous year to 23.4 million euros (previous year: 20.7 million euros).\n\nOther operating expenses increased significantly, by 16.6 million euros to 131.0 million euros (previous year: 114.4 million euros). In proportion to turnover they likewise increased by 2.1 percentage points to 32.6 % (previous year: 30.5 %). This increase is chiefly due to the sale of futalis, which resulted in a loss of 10.3 million euros and higher selling expenses.\n\nThe financial result has risen from 9.6 million euros in the previous year to 15.1 million euros. This is mainly due to the higher volume of earnings provided by affiliates as well as other equity investments.\n\nEarnings before income taxes have decreased year-on-year to the current 57.1 million euros (previous year: 58.1 million euros) and amount to 14.2 % of turnover (previous year: 15.5 %).\n\nDespite the lower earnings before tax figure, tax expenses have increased slightly to 20.1 million euros (previous year: 19.4 million euros), with a higher income tax ratio.\n\nNet income for the year amounts to 36.7 million euros (previous year: 38.5 million euros), with a post-tax profitto-turnover ratio of 9.1 % (previous year: 10.3 %).\n\n## Asset position\n\nCEWE-KGaA's total assets rose by 62.0 million euros on the previous year to 717.9 million euros.\n\nThe proportion of fixed assets has increased. At 334.3 million euros, it is 14.6 million euros higher than in the previous year (previous year: 319.6 million euros). This is principally due to the expansion of the company's production plant in Eschbach.\n\nCurrent assets have increased by 47.1 million euros to 378.2 million euros. This mainly reflects the 54.2 million euros rise in cash and cash equivalents to 101.9 million euros and, conversely, the 10.8 million euros decrease in receivables and other assets to 250.0 million euros. Inventories are at 22.7 million euros (previous year: 21.8 million euros) 3.6 million euros higher than in the previous year.\n\nEquity has increased overall by 11.4 million euros to 377.4 million euros, due to the unappropriated profits realised less the dividend paid in the financial year 2023 for 2022 and the purchase of treasury shares, with an equity ratio of 52.6 % (previous year: 55.8 %).

KGaA\n\nThe development of accruals has been shaped, in particular, by the accruals for pensions, which have increased by 3.1 million euros year-on-year to 33.3 million euros.\n\nLiabilities have risen by 47.1 million euros to 276.8 million euros. This is mainly due to the 42.0 million euros increase in amounts owed to affiliates to 218.8 million euros – on account of a rise in the volume of cash pool liabilities – as well as the 4.8 million euros growth in trade payables to 38.9 million euros.\n\n#### Financial position\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nOf the investments in fixed assets excluding financial assets, throughout the various locations of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, 31.2 million euros consisted of property, plant and equipment while 3.6 million euros comprised intangible assets.\n\nIn the past financial year, with a figure of 15.6 million euros much of the company's investments in property, plant and equipment was invested in technical equipment and machinery, followed by 10.4 million euros invested in assets under construction, 4.4 million euros invested in other equipment, furniture and fixtures and 0.7 million euros invested in land.\n\nFinancial assets have increased by 12.9 million euros on the previous year. This is mainly attributable to loans to affiliates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, commitments totalled 9.8 million euros. Of this amount, 9.3 million euros consisted of property, plant and equipment (of which 6.3 million euros for the construction of a production shop), while 0.5 million euros comprised intangible assets.\n\n#### **Financing**\n\nThe credit facilities negotiated in the financial year 2018 were agreed with a total of ten private banks and publicly owned banks. As of the reporting date, the loans taken up have a term of between one and three years (previous year: between one and four years). At the end of the year, the total credit line of the CEWE Group amounted to 91.0 million euros (previous year: 153.0 million euros); this decrease is attributable to the repayment according to schedule of lines of credit no longer required on a long-term basis. After deducting the total volume of credit drawn against (0.0 million euros, previous year: 0.84 million euros) – this does not involve drawing with an impact on liquidity and instead comprises the amount deducted by the credit institutions for guarantees provided – and allowing for the company's existing liquidity (117.37 million euros, previous year: 73.07 million euros), its strong liquidity potential as of the reporting date totalled 207.5 million euros (previous year: 225.23 million euros). The company thus has sufficient long-term revolving credit lines which have been granted for a period of up to three years, continuously renewed one-year lines plus lines of credit made available until further notice whose overall purpose is financing of the company's liquidity requirements, which fluctuate strongly over the course of a given year due to seasonal factors. In principle, no restrictions apply in relation to the use of credit lines. This ensures that CEWE will be able to fully comply with its payment obligations.\n\nAll long-term credit commitments are subject to normal bank agreements. No financial covenants have been agreed. No significant collateral was provided. The interest terms for current account loans are based on €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) as the base interest rate, plus a normal margin in Germany; the interest terms for almost all of the other financing arrangements are based on the one- to three-month EURIBOR as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany. For further details, please see the comments on current interest-bearing financial liabilities (item D64, **[see page 171](#page-172-0)**) and the comments in the combined management report ( **[see page 66](#page-67-0)**).\n\nFor CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the cash flow from operating activities calculated according to GAS 21 increased to 111.2 million euros in the financial year 2023 (previous year: 65.2 million euros). It thus exceeded the cash flow from investing activities of – 22.9 million euros (previous year: – 43.2 million euros). Cash flow from financing activities amounts to – 34.1 million euros (previous year: – 33.9 million euros). Overall, cash and cash equivalents have thus decreased to 101.9 million euros (previous year: 47.7 million euros).\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n3 Combined Management Report\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span><sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>83</sup>\n\n# Reports on the company's management\n\n## Management declaration\n\nThis management declaration under §289f and §315d of the German Commercial Code includes the declaration of conformity in accordance with §161 AktG; a reference to the company's website on which the remuneration report for the last financial year and the auditor's report pursuant to §162 AktG and the most recent resolution as regards remuneration pursuant to §113 (3) AktG have been made public; relevant details of corporate governance practices beyond the scope of applicable statutory requirements; and a description of the procedures of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and the makeup and procedures of their committees. It also includes information concerning the stipulations in §76 (4) AktG and §111(5) AktG, information on the minimum proportions of male and female members for the makeup of the Supervisory Board in accordance with §96 (2) AktG, information on whether the company has appointed at least one woman and at least one man to the Board of Management during the reference period, and a description of the company's diversity concept.\n\n#### **Declaration of conformity under §161 of the German Stock Corporation Act**\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board submitted the following declaration pursuant to § 161 AktG in November 2023:\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA attributes great importance to the principles of sound corporate governance.\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA confirm, in accordance with §161 AktG,\n\ntheir compliance, now and in the future, with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code government commission, as notified by the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in the official section of the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger), as amended on April 28, 2022 (\"GCGC\"), with the following exceptions:\n\n#### **Modifications due to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's legal form as a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien – KGaA). In the case of a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares, the general partner has the responsibilities which are handled by the board of management of a public limited company (Aktiengesellschaft – AG). The sole general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, whose Board of Management manages the business of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe rights and obligations of the supervisory board of a stock-market-listed partnership limited by shares are limited by comparison with those of the supervisory board of a stock corporation. In particular, the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA does not have the power to appoint the Board of Management of the general partner, to prescribe the contractual terms for the Board of Management of the general partner, to issue rules of procedure for the Board of Management or to stipulate transactions subject to approval. Those tasks are performed by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung.\n\nThe Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA are of the opinion that, where the GCGC, as amended, includes recommendations regarding the tasks and competences of the Supervisory Board which are performed by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung on account of the company's legal form, these recommendations are not applicable to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA. This applies for the recommendations of the GCGC concerning the makeup of the Board of Management (Recommendations B.1 to B.5) and its remuneration (Recommendations G.1 to G.16). Insofar as the company will deviate from these recommendations in the future on account of its legal form, this is not explicitly disclosed in this declaration of conformity since these recommendations do not apply for the company. This is without prejudice to applicable statutory provisions.\n\nTaking into consideration the above-mentioned details specific to the company's legal form, the Board of Management of the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA confirm in accordance with § 161 AktG that the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, as amended, (\"GCGC\"), have been complied with since the submission of the most recent declaration of conformity in November 2022 (with the exceptions listed below) and will continue to be complied with in future (with the following exceptions):\n\n#### **Elections to the Supervisory Board: attachment of curricula vitae and their contents (deviation from Recommendation C.14 GCGC)**\n\nIn case of impending elections to the Supervisory Board, including the curricula vitae of all of the candidates in the invitation to the general meeting would mean that many\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/23 description: The image shows the words \"cewe group\" in a simple, sans-serif font. The text is black and appears to be on a white background.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\npublication.\n\n## Annual Report 2023\n\ninvitation. Nor do we comply with the recommendation to list the \"key activities\" of candidates in their curricula vitae in this respect. §§ 124 (3) clause 4 and 125 (1) clause 5 AktG include definitive and sufficient stipulations regarding the information to be provided for proposed Supervisory Board candidates. The candidate's current profession and seats on other executive boards must be declared; these details will provide a more detailed impression of the nature and scope of this candidate's other activities and his or her technical qualifications. To require further details\n\nwould go beyond the text of the law and ultimately result in increased legal uncertainty, also because the term \"key activities\" is too imprecise and can be variously interpreted given the wide range of available life choices.\n\n**Rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board: making the rules of procedure accessible on the company's website (deviation from Recommendation D.1 GCGC)** The Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has established rules of procedure for its activities. These rules of procedure are a key instrument in the organisation of the Supervisory Board which regulates procedural issues arising on the Supervisory Board. We are therefore of the view that these rules of procedure are an internal docu-\n\nis already a very long document, which would then be unwieldy. For this reason, the company does not intend to follow the Code's recommendation that curricula vitae be \"attached\" to candidate proposals. The improvement in the quality of the information for shareholders which this recommendation envisages will be more efficiently achieved by providing the curricula vitae of all candidates on the company's website and by additionally pointing out this opportunity to obtain further information in the\n\nadditional pages would be unnecessarily added to what\n\n## **Remuneration system for Supervisory Board/ remuneration report**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA (CEWE-KGaA), with its specific legal form, is legally represented by its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung). This operates through its Board of Management, which thus also manages CEWE-KGaA. CEWE-Stiftung makes decisions regarding the remuneration system for the Board of Management, on the basis of the rules applicable for CEWE-Stiftung. The Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA are responsible for the remuneration reporting – i.e. the voluntary publication of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the publication and presentation of the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG. The underlying documents and the resolution passed by the general meeting in accordance with § 113 (3) AktG on the remuneration received by the members of the Supervisory Board are available at **[ir.cewe.de](https://ir.cewe.de/websites/cewe/English/6000/corporate-governance.html)**.\n\n#### **Disclosures on management practices**\n\nThe CEWE Group has an established tradition of conducting its business affairs in compliance with national and international legislation as well as generally acknowledged ethical principles.\n\n#### **Commitment to social responsibility as a part of CEWE's corporate culture**\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is aware of its social responsibility, which it considers to be an important factor in the company's long-term success. In this respect, the CEWE Group has developed a mission statement which sets out its corporate culture, which is characterised by integrity, trustworthiness and responsibility. The basic values and principles of this mission statement may be viewed online at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compli](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)[ance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)**.\n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has also summarised its key principles in a Code of Conduct which is based on ethical values and related business principles that reflect integrity and loyalty. This Code of Conduct applies for all of the Group's employees and requires compliance with the following operating principles:\n\n- Our activities are defined by integrity and lawful behaviour.\n- We aim to safeguard and to expand the CEWE Group's leading position as Europe's foremost provider of photo services.\n- We pursue appropriate business relationships, which are free of any dishonest practices.\n- We avoid any conflicts between the interests of the CEWE Group and private interests.\n- We treat business information and trade secrets confidentially.\n- We will not tolerate any abuse of employees' positions for personal advantage, for the benefit of third parties or to the detriment of the CEWE Group.\n\nFurther information on our Code of Conduct is publicly available on the following website: **[https://company.cewe.](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html) [de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)** \n\nCEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA also supports the principles of the compliance initiative of the German Association for Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics.

KGaA and the rules of procedure of the company's various committees, rules are in place at CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for its management and for supervision of its management which comply with the requirements of the GCGC. The company fulfils the GCGC's requirement of protection for investors bearing entrepreneurial risk.\n\nThe Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the Supervisory Board maintain a close and trusting working relationship, while safeguarding the interests of the company. All key business transactions are discussed together with the competent committees. In particular, the details of the relationship between the Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and the Supervisory Board and issues for which the Board of Management requires approval are laid down in the rules of procedure of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Management**\n\nThe general partner Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (\"the management\") holds 20,020 no-par value bearer shares in the share capital of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and thus approx. 0.27 %, while the limited shareholders hold the remainder of the shares. Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung manages the company's business through its Board of Management in accordance with applicable legislation, the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its own articles of association and also the\n\nrules of procedure for its Board of Management. Due to its unlimited personal liability, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung has a considerable interest in the orderliness and efficiency of the business activities of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, which it accordingly encourages. The rules of procedure adopted by the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and approved by the Board of Trustees for the Board of Management set out the allocation of duties and cooperation on the Board of Management. The Board of Management passes resolutions at its meetings, which are normally held once a week. Each member of the Board of Management notifies the other members in good time of important events and transactions within his area of business. Specific tasks are assigned to individual members of the Board of Management by means of a schedule of responsibilities.\n\nThe management determines the strategic orientation of the company, plans and specifies the company's budget, is responsible for the allocation of financial resources and supervises the company's business development. It is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the consolidated financial statements as well as the quarterly and semi-annual financial statements. The management also ensures compliance with statutory, official and internal regulations and ensures that all of the companies of the CEWE Group comply with these regulations. Through its integrated governance, risk and compliance approach, the Board of Management has established and implemented a control framework for the CEWE Group which aims to ensure an appropriate and effective internal control and risk management system. The measures implemented within the scope of this approach are likewise aimed to ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness\n\nof the internal control and risk management system. Further information about these measures is provided in the opportunities and risk report, for instance ( **[see](#page-70-0)  [pages 69 ff.](#page-70-0)**). At the same time, independent reviews and audits are carried out within the scope of this three-line model and in accordance with the applicable statutory framework. In particular, these include the audits performed by the internal auditing function and its reporting to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board as well as other external audits.\n\nThe Board of Management is not aware, through its dealing with the internal control and risk management system or from the reporting provided by the internal auditing function, of any significant circumstances indicating that these systems, in their totality, are not appropriate and effective. The management notifies the Supervisory Board of the course of business and the company's position at least once a quarter. The management also notifies the Supervisory Board at least once per year regarding the annual planning and the company's strategy. Moreover, the management notifies the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively regarding any strategy, planning, business development, risk position, risk management and compliance issues which are relevant for the company and thus comprehensively complies with its reporting obligation. In addition, the management reports regularly, promptly and comprehensively – in writing or orally – on any matters which are of material significance for the company. Further details are stipulated in the rules of procedure for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and in the articles of association of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nManagement Report 4 Remu\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n#### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in its management of the company and advises it accordingly. The competences of the Supervisory Board are laid down in its rules of procedure. The key tasks of the Supervisory Board include its review of the company's quarterly reports, its auditing of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and its preparation of the resolution to be passed by the general meeting for approval of the annual financial statements. The members of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA are appointed in accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – MitbestG).\n\nOn the basis of the information provided by the company's management, the Supervisory Board considers the course of business and the company's position at least once a quarter. The members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung are invited to attend the meetings of the Supervisory Board, unless the Supervisory Board resolves otherwise in an individual instance. For part of each Supervisory Board meeting, the Supervisory Board deliberates on its own without the members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung being present. Moreover, at each of its meetings the Supervisory Board systematically discusses the following issues:\n\n- Corporate governance\n- Compliance\n- The company's risk situation\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Board of Trustees are notified of key decisions of the Board of Management early on. The management and the Supervisory Board also regularly discuss issues of strategy and planning as well as current business developments outside of these meetings. The Supervisory Board maintains regular contact with the management, so as to obtain early notification of the company's current business development as well as significant business transactions. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses whether conflicts of interest may apply for members of the Board of Management or the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in relation to the work which they perform for CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **Supervisory Board committees**\n\nIn the period under review, an Audit Committee performed the tasks required of it by law and assigned to it under the rules of procedure approved by the overall Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's discussions and resolutions concerning the approval of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements and the proposal to be made to the general meeting on the appointment of the auditor. It is also concerned with monitoring the financial reporting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, compliance and the internal audit system as well as the external audit, in particular the selection and independence of the auditor, the quality of its audit and the additional services provided by the auditor.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the members of the Audit Committee were Ms Daniela Mattheus (Chairwoman), Mr Markus Schwarz (Deputy Chairman), Mr Kersten Duwe and Mr Nurol Altan. Pursuant to § 107 (4) in conjunction with § 100 (5) AktG, at least one member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of financial reporting and at least one further member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of auditing. In the field of auditing, the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Ms Daniela Mattheus, has particular knowledge and experience of auditing. Following a long career with a series of well-known audit firms, Ms Daniela Mattheus is now a self-employed consultant and serves on various supervisory boards. Ms Daniela Mattheus therefore continuously deals with auditing issues in her capacity as a member of the supervisory boards of Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bahn AG, Berlin, and Jenoptik AG, Jena.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 Mr Kersten Duwe was a further expert pursuant to § 100 (5) AktG on the Audit Committee. As a lawyer and tax adviser, he has the relevant expertise and serves on the Audit Committee as a financial expert in the area of financial reporting.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nto the shareholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board has also established a Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee prepares the resolutions to be passed by the Supervisory Board on nominations which are to be submitted to the general meeting regarding the appointment of Supervisory Board members provided by the limited shareholders. It follows the criteria specified by the Supervisory Board on its makeup as well as the competence profile adopted by the Supervisory Board. As of December 31, 2023, Mr Kersten Duwe, Dr Vemmer and Mr Paolo Dell'Antonio are the mem-\n\nIn order to provide more efficient support in relation to the ongoing development of the Group-wide IT structure, the Supervisory Board appointed an advisory committee. The Board of Management keeps this committee regularly informed of key developments. Ms Petra Adolph, Dr Birgit Vemmer (Chairwoman), Mr Marc Bohlken and Mr Paolo Dell' Antonio were elected to this committee. Its first\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees regularly undergo an efficiency review of their own and incorporate the findings in their future activities. At its meeting of March 17, 2021, the Supervisory Board carried out a self-evaluation of the effectiveness of its functioning as a supervisory board within the meaning of Recommendation D.12 of the GCGC. Various members suggested enhancing the work of the Supervisory Board through additional training opportunities and presentations by external experts.\n\nbers of the Nomination Committee.\n\nmeeting was held at the start of 2024.\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\nFor further information, please refer to the report of the Supervisory Board **[pages 42 ff.](#page-43-0)** of this annual report and online at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html) [compliance.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/responsibility/compliance.html)**).\n\n#### **Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung**\n\nSome of the tasks which are performed by a public limited company's supervisory board are handled by Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung at CEWE, specifically by the Board of Trustees of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung. Accordingly, the details of the Board of Trustees are outlined below.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has six members. The Board of Trustees advises and supervises the Board of Management. It keeps up-to-date regarding the affairs of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA and may inspect and audit the commercial books and other documents of the company and also its assets for this purpose. According to § 7 (2) of the articles of association of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the management requires the consent of the Supervisory Board for certain transactions beyond the scope of normal business. The articles of association of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung also stipulate the consent of the Board of Trustees for certain extraordinary measures enacted by the management. The Board of Trustees is convened as required, but meets at least four times a year.\n\n#### **The general meeting of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA**\n\nIn particular, the annual general meeting passes resolutions regarding the approval of the annual financial statements, appropriation of unappropriated profits, ratification of the actions of the general partner and the members of the Supervisory Board, and the appointment of the auditor. The general meeting is also entitled to resolve amendments to the articles of association. The limited shareholders of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA exercise their rights at the general meeting.\n\n#### **Target figures pursuant to §76 (4) and §111 (5) AktG and minimum proportions for the makeup of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board**\n\nSince the company does not have any Board of Management pursuant to § 278 AktG, the provision laid down in § 111 (5) AktG concerning the makeup of the Board of Management does not apply for the company. Moreover, the obligation to determine a target size for the Board of Management is not applicable insofar as the requirement under § 76 (3a) AktG concerning the membership of this Board of Management is applicable (§ 111 (5) clause 9 AktG). In accordance with the statutory requirements, no target quota has been specified for the Board of Management.\n\nThe German Stock Corporation Act, as amended by the Second German Act on Management Positions (Zweites Führungspositionen-Gesetz – FüPoG II), prescribes that stock-market-listed companies which consist of equal numbers of representatives and which have a board of\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>87</sup>\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>88</sup>\n\nmanagement comprising more than three members must appoint at least one woman and at least one man to their board of management. Irrespective of the legal question of whether §76 (3a) AktG is at all applicable to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, either directly or analogously, the company complied with this requirement in the reporting period, since Ms Yvonne Rostock was appointed Chairwoman (CEO) with effect as of March 1, 2023 and Ms Christina Sontheim-Leven was appointed to the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung with effect as of January 1, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the statutory obligation stipulated in § 76 (4) AktG and its own long-term human resources goal of achieving a gender balance, the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung has specified the following new targets which it aims to achieve by June 30, 2027:\n\n- first management level of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA below the Board of Management: 33.3 % of management positions held by women\n- second management level of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA below the Board of Management: 40 % of management positions held by women\n\nThe first management level comprises all of the executives of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA with a direct reporting line to the Board of Management. The second management level comprises all of the executives of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA reporting to executives with a direct reporting line to the Board of Management.\n\nAs an international company with (management) structures which reflect this orientation, while aiming to achieve an equal number of male and female employees in management positions in the long term, the CEWE Group has set itself a voluntary target of increasing the proportion of women in management positions in all of its companies (national subsidiaries) and brands. A glance at the CEWE Group as a whole shows that things are already moving in the right direction.\n\nNew elections to the Supervisory Board were held in the reporting period. The Supervisory Board has twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the company's shareholders and half by its employees. The Supervisory Board had four female members appointed by the shareholders following the new elections. Of the Supervisory Board members appointed by the shareholders, a women's quota of two thirds (four out of six seats held by the shareholders' representatives) was thus achieved. The Supervisory Board had two female members appointed by the employees following the new elections. Of the Supervisory Board members appointed by the employees, a women's quota of one third (two out of six seats held by the employees' representatives) was thus achieved. The shareholders and the employees therefore both fulfilled the statutory requirement of a minimum women's quota of 30 % on the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Diversity concept in regard to the makeup of the Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board**\n\nRecommendations A.2, B.1 and C.1 clause 2 of the GCGC deal with the issue of diversity in terms of appointments to the Board of Management and management positions within the company as well as the makeup of the Supervisory Board. With the goal of sound corporate governance, the management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA have considered this issue in detail within the scope of their responsibilities.\n\n#### **Makeup of the Board of Management**\n\nThe Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung consisted of five male members and (from March 1, 2023) two female members in the reporting period. All of the members of the Board of Management have international experience.\n\nMs Yvonne Rostock was appointed the Chairwoman (CEO) of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung and thus of the CEWE Group with effect as of March 1, 2023. As well as holding the post of CEO, Ms Yvonne Rostock also has overall responsibility for the CEWE Group's distribution activities.\n\nThe company seeks to ensure the adequate representation of women and in general to reflect diversity in its appointments of members of the Board of Management.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Reports on the company's management\n\n**Financial Statements** 6 Fur\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>89</sup>\n\n#### **Makeup of the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA in § 2.1 of the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. In principle, membership of the Supervisory Board is to end on December 31 in the year in which the respective Supervisory Board member reaches the age of 71. In deviation from this principle, the other members of the Supervisory Board may resolve with a two-thirds majority to extend this person's membership, but not beyond the end of the year in which the member in question reaches the age of 75.\n\n#### **Composition targets and competence profile of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn September 2023, the Supervisory Board defined its competence profile and published this on the company's website at **[https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate-group.html)[group.html](https://company.cewe.de/en/about-us/corporate-group.html)**. The current members of the Supervisory Board match this competence profile.\n\n#### **Independence of the Supervisory Board members**\n\nWith its makeup during the reporting period, the Supervisory Board almost entirely complied with the requirements set out in Recommendations C.1 to C.12 of the GCGC. The Supervisory Board has reviewed the independence of its members.\n\nMr Frank Zweigle was appointed a member of the Supervisory Board pursuant to the order of Oldenburg Local Court with effect from January 1, 2023 for a period of office expiring at the end of the 2023 general meeting. At the same time, Mr Zweigle was appointed to the position of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, starting on January 1, 2023 and ending at the 2023 general meeting.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that, until December 31, 2021, Mr Frank Zweigle was a member of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung, he was independent of the company and of the Board of Management of the general partner, since he did not have any personal or business relationship with the company or the Board of Management such as would constitute a significant and not merely temporary conflict of interest. Membership of the Board of Management of the general partner in the two years prior to his appointment is only one of four indicators which, according to the GCGC, were to be taken into consideration when assessing the independence of the members of the Supervisory Board. It was not decisive on its own. In the view of the Supervisory Board, all of the relevant circumstances must be jointly considered in order to assess the independence of a Supervisory Board member. The other three indicators expressly mentioned in the GCGC which must be assessed when evaluating the independence of a Supervisory Board member were not fulfilled in the case of Mr Frank Zweigle. These indicators are whether the Supervisory Board member or a close relative\n\n- currently maintains, or has maintained in the year leading up to his or her appointment, either directly or as a shareholder or via a position of responsibility with a company outside of the corporate group, a significant business relationship with the company or a dependent enterprise,\n- is a close relative of a member of the Board of Management.\n- has belonged to the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years.\n\nIn the view of the Supervisory Board, it was in the interests of the company that it be able to continue to make use of Mr Frank Zweigle's long-standing experience as a member of the Board of Management of the general partner. The Supervisory Board is satisfied that a period of two years from Mr Frank Zweigle's resignation from the Board of Management of the general partner was not necessary in order to ensure his independence.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance<br>2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report<br>→ Reports on the company's management              | 4 Remuneration                                               | 5 Financial Statements                                                                    | 6 Further Information                                                                                    |                                         |                                                                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                         |                                                      |                                                                                                       | 90                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Skills and expertise matrix                 |                                                                                    |                                                              |                                                                                           |                                                                                                          |                                         |                                                                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                         |                                                      |                                                                                                       |                             |\n|                                             | 1.

The company has thus more than fulfilled the statutory requirement of 30 % female representation on its Supervisory Board. While fulfilling\n\napplicable statutory requirements, in any future nominations the Supervisory Board will also appropriately consider whether candidates have the necessary skills, competences and technical experience which are required for service on the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Appointments to management positions**\n\nIn compliance with Recommendation A.2 of the GCGC, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has already implemented a large number of measures which are intended to promote diversity – in particular, a greater share of women – in management positions.\n\nFor instance, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has enacted the following specific measures to encourage a better balance between career and family needs:\n\n- Contract with \"AWO Eltern- und Seniorenservice\" in Oldenburg to provide free consultations for employees needing to arrange placements for their children or for their parents.\n- Since August 2022, two large day nurseries at CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's site in Oldenburg. The second nursery means that additional places can be offered in view of the high level of demand.\n- Course enabling mothers and fathers to strengthen their minds (\"Rediscover your power\").\n- Programme to help employees keep in touch during parental leave.\n- Management while working part-time.\n- Mobile working and more flexible work hours which provide support and makes things easier for employees in various life situations.\n- Own care programme for children during the Easter, summer and autumn holidays.\n\nRecruitment measures have also been further improved. For example:\n\n- Revised wording in job advertisements\n- Planned participation at career fairs which are specifically aimed at a female audience (HERCareer)\n- Stronger focus on advertising jobs which include part-time roles\n\nMoreover, at its meeting held on February 13, 2023 the Board of Management had expressly confirmed the resolution passed by the Board of Management of CEWE COLOR Holding AG on January 31, 2011:\n\nThe company seeks to ensure the adequate representation of women and in general to reflect diversity in its appointments to management positions. As well as the existing measures enacted in support of this criterion, the following measures are to be implemented in addition:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nand the structuring of internal development programmes\n\nIn regard to proposed appointments to management positions, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA also takes into consideration factors including candidates' age, gender, cultural origin and educational and professional backgrounds and seeks to achieve the greatest possible level of diversity.\n\nDrafting and implementation of a programme which considers the issues of \"Women in management positions\", \"Promotion of women as junior executives\" and \"International approach at the management level\". This resolution remains valid for appointments to management positions\n\n## Final declaration by the Board of Management\n\nof the general partner on the report on relationships with affiliates\n\nThe status of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung as the general partner of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA means that, in principle, CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA is dependent on Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung within the meaning of §17 AktG. Since no control agreement has been concluded with Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung in accordance with § 291 AktG, as the management body of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA (CEWE-KGaA), with its specific legal form, is legally represented by its general partner, Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung). This operates through its Board of Management, which thus also manages CEWE-KGaA. CEWE-Stiftung makes decisions regarding the remuneration system for the Board of Management, on the basis of the rules applicable for CEWE-Stiftung. The Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA are responsible for the remuneration reporting – i.e. the voluntary publication of the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung – and the publication and presentation of the remuneration report pursuant to §§ 162 and 120 a (4) AktG.\n\n## Basic features of the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\n\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management is clearly designed and easy to understand. The Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung is responsible for drafting the contracts of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Trustees assumes that all of the members of the Board of Management will make equal contributions to the success of the CEWE Group. However, the remuneration paid to the Chairman of the Board of Management differs to an appropriate degree, on account of his greater level of responsibility. The\n\nremuneration system is moreover in keeping with international practice and the necessary level of flexibility for what is, to a considerable extent, a seasonal business model. This remuneration continues to comprise fixed and performance-related variable components. As well as the tasks handled by the members of the Board of Management, the criteria for determination of overall remuneration are the economic success of the CEWE Group and its peer group. The company's remuneration structure is intended to promote its sustainable and positive longterm development.\n\n#### **Determination, implementation and review of the remuneration system**\n\nThe remuneration paid over to the members of the Board of Management is determined by the Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung. It thereby complies with the requirements of the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung – VorstAG). Insofar as a remuneration consultant is involved in the process of drafting the remuneration system, the Board of Trustees will ensure that this consultant is independent of the Board of Management and the company. No external remuneration expert has been consulted for the current remuneration system.\n\nThe Board of Trustees ensures that the overall remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is, on the one hand, proportionate to their tasks and performance\n\nwhile, on the other, appropriately reflecting the CEWE Group's economic and financial position. In addition, the Board of Management's remuneration has been designed with the company's long-term and sustainable development in mind.\n\nThe Board of Trustees continuously reviewed the appropriateness of this remuneration in 2023. Within the scope of its review, in a horizontal comparison remuneration levels of companies of a similar size and level of complexity are compared. In a vertical comparison, the remuneration paid to the management levels below the Board of Management and the average remuneration paid to the workforce of the CEWE Group are considered. Finally, the development of these variables over time is also taken into consideration.\n\nThe remuneration system safeguards the company's longterm development by ensuring a balance between performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration components, thus preventing the members of the Board of Management from entering into disproportionately high risks in order to achieve bonuses.\n\n#### **Overall context for the remuneration system**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management receive fixed remuneration and variable remuneration for their service. Their variable remuneration consists of a bonus plus longterm incentive components.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe contracts concluded with the members of the Board of Management all contain the same terms regarding remuneration; this relates to the contractual provisions as well as the structure of remuneration, with the exception of the maximum remuneration in the case of bonus II. The Chairwoman of the Board of Management enjoys superior remuneration-related conditions to those of the other Board of Management members.\n\n#### **Fixed gross remuneration**\n\nThe fixed gross remuneration consists of a fixed monthly amount (fixed remuneration) as well as non-cash remuneration (fringe benefits). The fixed remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Management is a good 50 % higher than that of all of the other ordinary members of the Board of Management. Fixed remuneration is paid out regardless of performance in equal monthly instalments. The fixed remuneration of the members of the Board of Management has been adjusted so that – with the exception of the Chairman of the Board of Management – each member of the Board of Management receives the same fixed remuneration; this consistency is maintained irrespective of the durations of the individual contracts.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management also receive non-cash remuneration, which is reported on the basis of the taxable amounts. This mainly consists of the use of a company car and occupational insurance premiums; the members of the Board of Management are entitled to receive the non-cash remuneration in the same way and pay tax on it. They are also entitled to the reimbursement of entertainment expenses and travel costs at the maximum rates permitted for tax purposes, insofar as such expenses and costs are exclusively incurred in the interests of CEWE-Stiftung.\n\nCEWE-Stiftung bears the Board of Management member's relocation costs. On a one-time basis, it will refund standard estate agent's fees for an appropriate, rented residence in Oldenburg or the local area. In the event of the member of the Board of Management purchasing a home, CEWE-KGaA will pay the equivalent of two monthly rent instalments on the basis of this property's rented value.\n\nThe company maintains a Group financial loss liability insurance policy (D&O insurance) for the members of the Board of Management. Cover for the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA complies with the requirements of the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration. The insured member of the Board of Management thus bears 10 % of a potential loss, up to one-and-ahalf times their fixed annual remuneration.\n\nInsurance cover also applies through third-party liability insurance for managers as well as insurance covering legal expenses under criminal law for all of the company's employees. The members of the Board of Management are also jointly insured against any violations which they commit, or are alleged to have committed, in the performance of their duties. The company has moreover taken out an accident insurance policy for all of its executives. This includes all of the members of the Board of Management.\n\n#### **Pension scheme**\n\nPension obligations apply in relation to the members of the Board of Management in the form of a direct commitment. The value of their pension entitlements is calculated on the basis of the fixed remuneration most recently paid for their service on the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung. The pension entitlement will have been vested\n\nfollowing a period of 15 years (in one case, 20 years) of service on the Board of Management and will not exceed between 50 % and two-thirds of the fixed remuneration last received by the member of the Board of Management in question. The structure of the pension scheme applies equally for all of the members of the Board of Management of CEWE-Stiftung. The pension benefit will be paid in twelve equal monthly instalments and shall be due on the last day of each month. As a rule, the commitments entered into do not include provision for dependants; however, provision has been made for dependants in some individual cases, with no effect on expenses. In individual cases, if the member of the Board of Management served as a managing director in the CEWE Group prior to his appointment to the Board of Management, as part of the company's pension scheme the company also maintains life insurance policies with a capital payment in the event of premature death as provision for dependants or, in case of survival, as a pension. Instead of the normal type of pension scheme described above, the new Chairwoman of the Board of Management who took up her position in the spring of 2023 will be transferred ownership of 5,000 shares of CEWE-KGaA upon completion of each year of service, in February of the following year of service.\n\n#### **Variable remuneration**\n\nThe members of the Board of Management receive variable, performance-related remuneration. The variable remuneration components are divided up into three different components and consist of one-year variable remuneration – i.e. a bonus share, payable annually (bonus I) – multi-year variable remuneration – in the form of a multi-year bonus share (bonus II) – and a long-term, share-based remuneration component (stock option plan). These remuneration components consist of the following core components:\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>99</sup>\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nBonus I and bonus II are calculated separately from one another.\n\nBonus I is based on earnings before taxes (EBT) as well as depreciation on property, plant and equipment and amortisation on intangible assets of the CEWE Group. Overall, it is limited to a maximum of 100 % of the fixed remuneration in a given year. This only includes bonus shares which are relevant for depreciation purposes and which have been earned through earnings before tax (earned depreciation). Bonus I will be calculated and paid out in the following year, within ten days of the consolidated financial statements having acquired binding force.\n\nBonus II with its multi-year component relates to earnings before taxes (EBT); it is calculated on the basis of the total EBT over the term of the employment contract of the Board of Management member in question. The multi-year bonus II will not attract any interest. In three cases, it is limited to a maximum of 100 % of the fixed remuneration. The balance resulting from bonus II is retained for the multi-year term of the contract of the respective member of the Board of Management and will be paid out six months after the end of this person's employment contract.\n\nFor both bonus portions, bonus I and bonus II, the Chairman of the Board of Management's entitlement is roughly 25 % to 50 % higher than that of a further ordinary member of the Board of Management.\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\nIn the event of a member of the Board of Management retiring over the course of a year, bonus I and bonus II will be calculated pro rata temporis and paid out in the following year within ten days of the consolidated financial statements acquiring binding force.\n\nStock option plans were established in 2019 and in the period from 2021 to 2023 in which the members of the Board of Management who held office at that time were permitted to participate in the same way and to the same extent. These plans are intended to reward the members of the Board of Management for the long-term improvement in the company's value via its share price. All of these stock option plans (SOP 2019, SOP 2021, SOP 2022 and SOP 2023) had (and have) essentially the same terms. Since the SOP 2019, they have been designed in such a way that, if the options are successfully exercised, the economic benefit will accrue in the form of CEWE-KGaA shares rather than in cash form. Participation in these\n\nplans and the volume of options purchased are subject to the discretion of the members of the Board of Management, up to a maximum total. They do not have any contractual entitlement for the implementation of these plans or for their participation in them. No holding period has been stipulated for participating members of the Board of Management in regard to shares arising from the stock option plans. The underlying prices, the performance targets and the fair value of the options within the scope of the currently applicable option programmes are indicated below. Please **[see pages 162 ff.](#page-163-0)** for further details of these programmes.\n\nNo non-financial performance targets have been agreed. The contracts of the members of the Board of Management do not include any clawback provisions.\n\nExtraordinary developments (such as the disposal of shares in the company and the realisation of hidden reserves) are not included in the calculation of bonus I and bonus II. In the event of a deterioration in the position of CEWE-KGaA, CEWE-Stiftung may reduce these amounts appropriately, if their continued grant would otherwise be unreasonable.\n\n#### **Stock option plans: fair values, underlying prices and performance targets**\n\n|          |                     | Number of<br>participants | Number of<br>rights issued | Fair value<br>euros/opt. | Fair value<br>in euros | Underlying<br>price<br>euros/opt. | Performance<br>premium<br>as % | Performance<br>target<br>euros/opt. |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| SOP 2023 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 18.19                    | 152,796.00             | 87.00                             | 120                            | 104.40                              |\n| SOP 2022 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 23.88                    | 200,592.00             | 76.00                             | 120                            | 91.20                               |\n| SOP 2021 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 22.63                    | 190,092.00             | 121.00                            | 120                            | 145.20                              |\n| SOP 2019 | Board of Management | 7                         | 8,400                      | 12.82                    | 107,688.00             | 81.00                             | 125                            | 101.25                              |\n| Total    | Board of Management |                           | 33,600                     |                          | 651,168.00             |                                   |                                |                                     |\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the extremely high level of motivation in the overall Board of Management, the Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung does not see any need for specific provisions or for overall target remuneration for individual members of the Board of Management. No distinctions have been made for different areas of business.\n\nOverall, the remuneration has been designed such that the fixed remuneration components account for around 50 % to 70 % of overall remuneration and the variable remuneration components for around 30 % to 50 % of overall remuneration.\n\n#### **Other remuneration-related arrangements**\n\nThe contracts with members of the Board of Management are exclusively term contracts which, according to the articles of association of CEWE-Stiftung, may be concluded for a period of up to five years. There is no provision for regular termination of a contract. The contracts of the members of the Board of Management currently vary in terms of their duration and end dates. In no case is the duration longer than a period of three years.\n\nThe following arrangements apply in the event of the premature termination of the contracts of the members of the Board of Management: in case of dismissal for good cause, their contracts will have been terminated as of the date of dismissal. In case of a dismissal which is not made for good cause or which is made on grounds lying outside of the responsibility of the member of the Board of Management, their fixed remuneration will be paid up to the end of the term of their contract. In addition, in this case this member of the Board of Management will receive a\n\nsettlement in the amount of half of their fixed remuneration in case of a period of at least twelve months before he begins to draw a pension, and otherwise a pro rata compensation amount. Pro rata payment rules apply for the payment of any positive bonus II balance. The company has not concluded any compensation agreements with the members of the Board of Management to cover the event of a takeover offer (§ 315a (1) no. 9 HGB).\n\nIn the event of a member of the Board of Management giving notice to quit due to a change of control, this member's fixed remuneration and bonuses I and II will be paid pro rata temporis. No settlement will be paid for the loss of future fixed remuneration or bonuses.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of CEWE-Stiftung reserves the right to agree a post-contractual non-compete clause.\n\nNo remuneration is granted by other companies in the CEWE Group. Nor has the company concluded any agreements on discretionary or guaranteed bonus payments.\n\n#### The remuneration system for members of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n\nThe remuneration of the Supervisory Board members merely consists of fixed remuneration; the company's long-term development is thus promoted, since the Supervisory Board's decisions are not influenced by the achievement of bonus targets. The remuneration system was drafted for the members of the Supervisory Board,\n\nseparately adopted by the Board of Management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board and then adopted by the general meeting on June 15, 2022. § 14 of the articles of association of CEWE-KGaA was revised in this respect. This new system applies from the financial year 2022 onwards.\n\nThe following detailed provisions apply: the basic remuneration of a member of the Supervisory Board is 43,000 euros (previous year: 43,000 euros). A higher level of remuneration is envisaged for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. This amounts to twice the level of basic remuneration for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and one-and-a-half times this amount for the Deputy Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Audit Committee. In addition, each Supervisory Board member receives an attendance fee of 2,000 euros (previous year: 2,000 euros) for their personal attendance of a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees, regardless of whether this is in person, in virtual form or over the telephone. Half of the fixed gross remuneration will fall due for payment as of June 30 of the current financial year and the other half, plus the attendance fees, within one month of the end of the financial year to which this remuneration relates.\n\nCEWE-KGaA reimburses the members of the Supervisory Board any value added tax payable on their remuneration. Members of the Supervisory Board are covered by the company's D&O insurance policy. A deductible of 10 % of the possible damage applies for them, up to a total amount of one-and-a-half times their fixed Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\ners 3 Combined Management Re\n\n→ Remuneration system\n\n6 Further Inform\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-103-0\"></span>The Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung (CEWE-Stiftung) and the Supervisory Board of CEWE-KGaA hereby provide the following remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG within the scope of their remuneration reporting. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are to present it to the general meeting of CEWE-KGaA in order for a resolution to be passed on its approval (§ 120a (4) AktG). This report covers the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the Supervisory Board members of CEWE-KGaA as well as former members of the Board of Management of the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG, which underwent a change of form in 2013 to become CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, and CEWE-Stiftung. At the general meeting held on June 7, 2023, the remuneration report for the financial year 2022 was approved by means of a resolution.\n\n#### **Individual remuneration of the members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung for 2023**\n\nThe following reporting of remuneration for the year under review and financial year 2023 is in accordance with § 162 AktG. The tables distinguish between the remuneration actually received (remuneration granted within the meaning of § 162 (1), clause 1 AktG) and remuneration which is already due but which has not yet been paid out (remuneration owed within the meaning of § 162 (1) clause 1 AktG); in addition, a distinction is made – and reported on a voluntary basis – between remuneration which is owed and\n\npromised but is not yet due and, finally, other benefits paid to a member of the Board of Management in the event of regular termination of their service (benefits within the meaning of § 162 (2), item 3 AktG).\n\n→ Remuneration report\n\nMs Yvonne Rostock joined the Board of Management as its Chairwoman on March 1, 2023; her remuneration is thus reported for the first time in this year under review. The breakdown of this remuneration is as follows for the individual members of the Board of Management:\n\nThe fixed remuneration of the serving members of the Board of Management was structured in individual cases so that all of the Board of Management members received the same amount of fixed remuneration, irrespective of the terms of their individual employment contracts. This remuneration remained unchanged in the period up to December 31, 2023. In deviation from the remuneration system, on joining the company in August 2023 Ms Rostock was paid a one-off joining bonus of 200,000 euros which is included in her fringe benefits.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration        | 5 Financial Statements | 6

Moreover, nor has the company entered into any contingent liabilities for the benefit of the members of the Board of Management. Insofar as contractual provisions on maximum remuneration are applicable, these were reviewed; they were not violated or exceeded in any case. No early termination of employment contracts was agreed in the year under review. Mr Zweigle, who resigned from the Board of Management on December 31, 2021, has retained the options which he acquired from the SOP 2017, SOP 2019 and SOP 2021 programmes. In the case of Dr Friege, who resigned on December 31, 2022, notwithstanding his resignation the options offered and purchased during his period of service will continue to apply for their respective term and Dr Friege is entitled to exercise them. In addition, no commitments were made to a former member of the Board of Management in connection with the termination of this person's service in the previous financial year which were granted in the previous financial year (§ 162 (2) no. 2 AktG). Finally, nor were any temporary deviations from the existing remuneration system agreed or resolved in the year under review.\n\n#### **Remuneration of the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA**\n\nThe Supervisory Board consists of twelve members. Since 2022, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members has consisted of fixed remuneration only. The provision applicable since the financial year 2022 is a new provision and has replaced the old stipulations in § 14 of the articles of association of CEWE-KGaA.\n\nThe following detailed provisions apply: the basic remuneration of a member of the Supervisory Board is 43,000 euros (previous year: 43,000 euros). A higher level of remuneration is envisaged for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. This amounts to twice the level of basic remuneration for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and one-and-a-half times this amount for the Deputy Chairman/Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Audit Committee. In addition, each Supervisory Board member receives an attendance fee of 2,000 euros (previous year: 2,000 euros) for their personal attendance of a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees, regardless of whether this is in person, in virtual form or over the telephone.\n\nHalf of the fixed gross remuneration will fall due for payment as of June 30 of the current financial year and the other half, plus the attendance fees, within one month of the end of the financial year to which this remuneration relates.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The following calculation was made in 2023 for remuneration components payable to the Supervisory Board members:\n\n#### **Supervisory Board remuneration, shareholdings, options** in thousands of euros\n\n| 20221                                         |                       |                 |                       |                         | 20232             |                       |                 |                       |                         |                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                               | Fixed<br>remuneration | Attendance fees | Total<br>remuneration | Shareholdings<br>number | Options<br>number | Fixed<br>remuneration | Attendance fees | Total<br>remuneration | Shareholdings<br>number | Options<br>number |\n| Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

The above amounts are exclusive of value added tax. None of the members of the Supervisory Board has received or been granted third-party payments in relation to their service. One member of the Supervisory Board provided consulting services to a limited extent in the year under review and the previous year (2023: 0 thousand euros, 2022: 14 thousand euros).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are also covered by the company's D&O insurance policy. A deductible of 10 % of the possible damage has been agreed for them, up to a total amount of one-and-a-half times their fixed Supervisory Board remuneration. No loans or advance payments have been granted to members of the Supervisory Board. Nor has the company entered into any contingent liabilities for their benefit.\n\n#### **Pension commitments and pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung or the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG**\n\nFor former members of the Board of Management of the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG and CEWE-Stiftung, as of December 31, 2023 the company had made pension accruals in the amount of 16,970 thousand euros (previous year: 14,393 thousand euros). Pension payments for the financial year 2023 amounted to 1,190 thousand euros (previous year: 1,091 thousand euros). With effect as of April 1, 2007, the pension commitments for the former members of the Board of Management who had already retired as of this date were transferred to CEWE COLOR Versorgungskasse e.V., Wiesbaden. They are included in the consolidated financial statements. The company's pension commitments for the other retired members of the Board of Management were maintained in the form of a direct commitment. Loans, advance payments or contingent liabilities have not been granted for former members of the executive bodies (i.e. the Board of Management or Supervisory Board, where applicable) of CEWE-Stiftung, the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG or the current CEWE-KGaA.\n\nThe company has not paid any remuneration to retired members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n≡ ⇱ 🔍 ⟨**114**⟩\n\n#### **Comparative presentation of the remuneration and earnings trend for the current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of CEWE Stiftung und Co. KGaA, the old CEWE COLOR Holding AG and Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung**\n\nThe following comparative presentation shows the annual change in the remuneration granted and owed for the current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the earnings trend for CEWE-KGaA and the CEWE Group and the remuneration received by employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The remuneration of employees is calculated on the basis of the average wages and salaries of employees of CEWE-KGaA in the financial year in question. The internal peer group has been deliberately limited to CEWE-KGaA, on the one hand due to the external comparison of the remuneration\n\npaid to CEWE's Board of Management with that of SDAX companies and, on the other, because CEWE-KGaA accounts for most of the Group's employees.\n\n#### **Comparative presentation of the remuneration and earnings trend** in thousands of euros\n\n|

It most recently did so for the financial year 2021. The company thus fulfils the statutory requirements. However, for the\n\nfinancial year 2023 it remains the case that men and women in executive roles are remunerated according to their position. No distinction is made between men and women in this respect. In addition, CEWE strongly emphasises equal opportunities for the development of men and women.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/0 description: The photograph captures a dramatic scene of a glacier calving, with seals resting on ice floes in the foreground. The glacier, a massive wall of blue ice, dominates the upper portion of the image. A large section of the glacier is in the process of breaking off, sending a spray of ice and water into the air. The water is a mix of blues and grays, reflecting the sky and the ice. In the foreground, several seals are lounging on small ice floes, seemingly unconcerned by the calving event. The seals are dark in color, contrasting with the white ice. The overall composition of the image is striking, with the power of nature on full display. Text on the left side of the image reads \"Christian Bovians, Germany - winner of the Nature category\".\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>5 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nImage /page/118/Figure/7 description: This image contains a list of financial statements and reports, including the consolidated profit and loss account (page 118), consolidated statement of comprehensive income (page 119), consolidated balance sheet (page 120), consolidated statement of changes in equity (page 122), consolidated cash flow statement (page 123), segment reporting by business unit (page 124), notes (page 125), responsibility statement (page 187), independent auditor's report (page 188), and the CEWE Group structure and executive bodies (page 195).\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration 5\n\n→ Consolidated profit and loss account\n\n6 Further Information\n\n<span id=\"page-119-0\"></span>Consolidated profit and loss account\n\nfor the financial year 2023 of CEWE Stiftung & Co.

However, they have not yet come into force, and their effects will only become apparent in a subsequent reporting year.\n\nThe new standards and amendments of existing standards are not expected to have any significant impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations. The following standards and interpretations and amendments of existing standards which have also been issued by the IASB as of the balance sheet date are not yet mandatorily applicable in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. They will become applicable following their adoption within the scope of the EU's endorsement of the IFRS.\n\n#### **Amendment/standard**\n\nStandards and interpretations which are not yet mandatorily applicable in the EU are listed here. However, they have been resolved with mandatory effect and are currently being transposed into national law within the scope of an EU endorsement process.\n\nThe future effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations resulting from implementation of the standards issued as of the reporting date but not yet mandatorily applicable are still being reviewed. Several standards may necessitate additional notes. The new standards will be adopted in the EU upon completion of the endorsement procedure.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>**Determination of fair values**\n\n#### As far as possible, CEWE uses data observable on the market in order to determine the fair value of an asset or a liability. On the basis of the input factors used within the scope of the valuation techniques, the fair values have been assigned to the different levels of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: valuation parameters which do not involve the quoted prices included in Level 1 but which are observable for the asset or the liability either directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3: valuation parameters for assets or liabilities which are not based on observable market data.\n\nWith the exception of the derivatives carried in the balance sheet at fair value, in these annual financial statements all assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost. For assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, the book values of the financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet represent a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\nDerivatives reported in the balance sheet are carried at fair value. The market values determined by credit institutions are arrived at by discounting the expected future cash flows throughout the remaining term of the contracts on the basis of individual, nonobservable input parameters (Level 3 according to IFRS 7). The effects are of minor significance.\n\nThe profit and loss account has been prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures refer to thousands of euros.\n\n## 3 Scope of consolidation\n\n→ Notes:\n\nA. General disclosures\n\nApart from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 include domestic and foreign companies over which CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA has a direct or indirect controlling interest. The Group has control over a company if it is exposed to risk in relation to fluctuating yields, or is entitled to receive these yields, from its holdings in the company in question, and if the Group also has the ability to use its power of control over the investee so as to affect the value of the yield granted by this investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements as of the point in time at which the relationship of control begins, and remain so until the relationship of control ends.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, apart from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, as the parent company, the scope of consolidation includes 12 German and 19 foreign companies (cf. E69, **[page 179](#page-180-0)**). The pension commitments transferred to the pension fund CEWE COLOR Versorgungskasse e.V., Wiesbaden, according to IAS 19 are also included in the scope of consolidation. No contractual trust arrangement (CTA) is applicable, since the pension commitments remain attributable to CEWE-KGaA from a legal point of view. Insofar as this pension fund is unable to meet its obligations on the basis of its own resources, resources are provided by CEWE-KGaA.\n\nAs in the previous year, [Bilderplanet.de](https://Bilderplanet.de) GmbH, Cologne, which is not operationally active, has not been included in the scope of consolidation due to its economic insignificance. The same applies for Diginet Danmark ApS, Åbyhøj, Denmark, which was newly established in October 2022 and is not yet operationally active.\n\nThe subsidiary futalis GmbH was sold on December 21, 2023. Control over this company was transferred to the purchaser on the same date. The CEWE Group has made an important contribution to the development of futalis' business over the past few years. This company will now make its next strategic moves under its own steam. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023 futalis was for the first time classified as held for sale. The previous-year figures in the consolidated profit and loss account have been restated accordingly, so as to present this discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. futalis GmbH is presented in the \"Other Activities\" business unit, **[page 22](#page-23-0)**.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nent Report 4 Remuneration\n\nents 6 Further Inform\n\n→ Notes: A.

For all of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements, the reporting date for the separate financial statements is the same as the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements, i.e. December 31, 2023.\n\nAcquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition costs correspond to the fair value of the assets provided, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities arising or assumed as of the transaction date. They also include the fair values of any recognised assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration agreement. Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which are identifiable within the scope of a company merger are measured at their fair values as of the date of their acquisition when first included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nAny costs associated with their acquisition are recognised as expenses as of the date of their accrual.\n\nAny contingent considerations are measured at fair value as of the date of their acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of an asset or a contingent consideration classified as a liability are measured within the scope of IFRS 9 and any resulting profit or loss is recognised either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nstatements 6 Further In\n\n# 6 Further Information\n\n→ Notes: A. General disclosures\n\nGoodwill is the value resulting from the surplus of the acquisition costs plus the value of the non-controlling interests in the acquired company and the fair value of any equity interests previously held as of the date of acquisition divided by the Group's interest in the net assets measured at fair value.\n\nIn case of the additional purchase of interests in companies already fully included in the scope of consolidation, this does not affect net income. This does not lead to any changes in the recognition of assets, liabilities and goodwill of the company already included in the scope of consolidation. The annual goodwill impairment tests are performed using the discounted cash flow method. This is calculated on the basis of future expected cash flows from the latest management planning, updated with long-term turnover growth rates as well as assumptions regarding margin and earnings trends and discounted in the value of the capital costs for the corporate unit. Testing is carried out at the level of the cash-generating unit. In the course of the year, an impairment test is also performed in case of events suggesting a permanent fall in value.\n\nIntragroup turnover, expenses and income and also loans, receivables and liabilities between the consolidated companies are eliminated. Interim profits from intragroup deliveries are consolidated insofar as they are significant for presentation of the actual net assets, financial position and results of operations. Intragroup deliveries and services are calculated on the basis of market prices and also on the basis of transfer prices determined according to the arm's length principle. Where necessary, deferred taxes are calculated for consolidation entries affecting earnings.\n\nStock option plans have been measured at fair value as issued equity instruments for future work, in accordance with IFRS 2. The resulting effects have been apportioned as expense throughout the period, recognised in personnel expenses and entered against equity. Insofar as the terms of options are not fulfilled, this item is reversed directly within equity.\n\nCompanies which are no longer classifiable as companies to be included in the scope of consolidation have been excluded accordingly. The relevant date is determined on the basis of the date of this company's withdrawal, i.e. the date of loss of control over its financial and business policy. Expenses and income resulting for the consolidated company up to its disposal are included in the consolidated profit and loss account. All of the assets and liabilities representing the consolidated company immediately prior to its withdrawal from the scope of consolidation will be considered as the disposal value. The effect on income of removal from the scope of consolidation is calculated by comparing the disposal or liquidation proceeds and the disposal value. The same consolidation methods have been used as in the previous year.\n\n#### 5 Currency translation\n\nThe annual financial statements of the foreign Group companies have been translated into euros according to the functional currency concept. Since the subsidiaries conduct their business independently in financial, economic and organisational terms, in principle the respective functional currency is identical with the national currency of the company in question. The reporting currency and functional currency of the Group is the euro.\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign companies included in the scope of consolidation are translated at the mid-market spot rates on the balance sheet date (balance sheet exchange rate), while income and expenses are translated at the average annual mean rates of exchange (profit and loss account exchange rate).\n\nGoodwill resulting for foreign subsidiaries as a result of capital consolidation is carried at historical cost.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\neholders 3 Combined Management Rep\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\n<sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>130</sup> → Notes: A.

Accounting and measurement principles\n\n## 6 General disclosures\n\nIn principle, as in the previous year the annual financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared on the basis of uniform accounting and measurement methods. Accounting and measurement options are exercised in the consolidated financial statements in the same way as in the annual financial statements.\n\nFor preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Management requires a series of assessments and estimates and makes assumptions affecting the application of accounting principles within the Group and also recognition of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. The actual amounts may deviate from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are continuously reviewed. The following estimates and associated assumptions may affect the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIf items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are acquired within the scope of company mergers, the fair value of these assets as of the date of acquisition and the expected useful life are estimated. Fair values and useful lives are calculated on the basis of the management's assessments.\n\nImpairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are determined on the basis of estimates regarding the cause, the date and the value of these impairments and, where permissible, revaluations. Indications of impairments, estimates of future cash flows and fair values of assets are evaluated on the basis of assessments regarding expected cash flows, useful lives, discount rates and residual values. The development of future cash flows is mainly determined by the future demand trend for products. If the actual demand trend falls short of expectations, this would negatively affect turnover and cash flows. Further expenses for valuation adjustments might thus result which would negatively affect future results of operations.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nTo deal with the default risk for receivables, as well as provisioning for credit risk (expected credit loss) valuation adjustments are established for doubtful accounts. Provisioning for credit risk is determined on the basis of the maturity structure, the current market situation and past experience. In the event of a deterioration in customers' financial situation, the actual bad debts may exceed the expected bad debts.\n\nThe CEWE Group is obliged to pay income taxes in various countries (chiefly in Europe). Material assumptions are therefore necessary for calculation of Group-wide income tax liabilities. Income taxes are determined by calculating for each taxable entity the expected actual amount of income tax and the deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences between the balance sheet items in the consolidated financial statements and the accounts prepared for tax purposes. This requires assumptions for interpretation of applicable tax regulations in Germany and other countries. This also requires an assessment of the possibility of realising a sufficiently high level of taxable income for each type of tax and in each tax jurisdiction. For some transactions and calculations, the final level of taxation cannot be conclusively determined. The Group assesses the value of accruals for expected tax audits on the basis of estimates of whether additional income taxes may fall due and the respective amount. Insofar as the final level of taxation for these transactions deviates from the initially assumed level of taxation, this will affect the actual and deferred taxes in the period in which the level of taxation is conclusively determined. If the final values (in the areas affected by estimates) were to deviate from the management's estimates by 10 %, the Group would be required to increase its tax liabilities by 768 thousand euros and its deferred tax liability by 159 thousand euros, in case of a negative deviation, or reduce its tax liabilities by 768 thousand euros and its deferred tax liability by 159 thousand euros in case of a positive deviation. Pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial procedures. These measurements are mainly based on assumptions regarding discount factors, salary and pension trends and life expectancies. Pensions and similar obligations may be subject to significant changes if these assumptions significantly deviate from actual trends due to changes in the market and economic environment.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of other accruals and contingent liabilities are highly dependent on the complexity of the underlying transaction as well as estimates. This requires assumptions regarding the probability of realisation and the value of the claim. This in turn depends on past experience, assessments of cost trends and the assessment of other information. Changes in these estimates may have a significant effect on results of operations.\n\nIndividual items have been summarised in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. They are reported separately in the notes. The Group classifies assets and liabilities as current if they are expected to be realised or settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### 7 Recognition of income and expenses\n\nThe ordinary activities of the CEWE Group comprise photofinishing and other printing services and trading of photographic hardware as well as photofinishing products and services. CEWE mainly realises revenues from the sale of goods and does so only marginally from the provision of services. Any income associated with the Group's ordinary activities is presented as revenue in the profit and loss account. All other income is presented as other operating income (cf. C28, **[page 139](#page-140-0)**). Revenues are recognised on the basis of a five-step model. Amounts which are expected as consideration for the transfer of goods to or for the provision of services for a customer must thus be recognised as revenues. Turnover will be realised where (or once) the power of disposal over goods or services has been transferred to a customer, either over a period of time or at a point in time. Operating expenses are recognised in profit or loss upon use of the service or as of the time at which they are incurred. In principle, turnover-related expenses or accruals are measured as of the date of realisation of the corresponding revenues; this includes estimated amounts for rebates and discounts and other sales deductions. Interest income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\nB. Accounting and measurement principles\n\n#### 8 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognised at cost and, in case of wear and tear, less scheduled straight-line depreciation. In the Commercial Online Printing business unit, the units-of-production depreciation method is used for offset printing machines. Production costs comprise all directly attributable costs as well as appropriate portions of the production-related overheads. Financing costs are capitalised. The profits or losses resulting from the write-off of the asset are calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the book value and are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income or expenses in the period in which this item is written off.\n\n#### 9 Lease accounting\n\nFor leases, as of initial recognition CEWE recognises a liability in the amount of the present value of the existing payment obligation, restated for lease payments reported as assets or liabilities. Variable lease payments only arise to a minor extent. The effective interest method is applied for subsequent accounting. For the present value calculation, discounting is implemented by means of a risk- and term-equivalent incremental borrowing rate of interest if it is not possible to determine the implicit interest rate. The shortterm portion of the lease liability which is shown separately in the balance sheet is calculated by means of the repayment portion of the lease payments over the next twelve months.\n\nCEWE measures all rights of use resulting from leases at amortised cost. Straight-line depreciation is recognised over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the identified asset. If events or changed circumstances point to the possibility of impairment, impairment testing will be implemented according to IAS 36.\n\nLease accounting is mainly influenced by the assessment of the term. All facts and circumstances which provide an economic incentive for the exercise of existing options are taken into consideration in order to determine the term of the lease. The assumed term therefore includes periods covered by extension options if the exercise of options can be assumed to be reasonably probable.\n\n## 10 Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties comprise land and buildings which are held in order to generate rental income or for capital appreciation and are not used for separate production, for delivery of goods or provision of services, for administrative purposes or for sale within the scope of ordinary activities.\n\nAs of their first-time measurement these assets are measured at amortised cost, including incidental costs. Within the scope of subsequent measurement, investment properties are recognised at amortised cost.\n\nInvestment properties are written off if they are sold or permanently no longer used and if no future economic benefit is expected as of their disposal. Profits or losses resulting from the shutdown or disposal of investment properties are recognised in the year of this shutdown or disposal.\n\nItems of real estate are assigned to the portfolio of investment properties in case of a change of use involving the end of the Group's own use or the beginning of an operating lease as a landlord with another party.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\nB.

In case of any such indications, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the scope of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset, unless an asset results in cash inflows which are not largely independent of those of other assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating units). In this case, the calculation will be performed at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the respective asset has been assigned. The respective value will be assigned to the individual cash-generating units or to the smallest group of cash-generating units on an appropriate and consistent basis.\n\n## 11 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill does not undergo scheduled amortisation and is tested for impairment once a year. It is also tested whenever events occur which indicate potential impairment.\n\n#### 12 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets comprise industrial property rights and similar rights, software acquired for consideration, proprietary software, customer bases and lists, trademark rights and advance payments made on such assets. Acquired and proprietary intangible assets are capitalised subject to the conditions laid down in IAS 38 \"Intangible Assets\".\n\nIntangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalised at cost, as are proprietary intangible assets which are expected to provide a future benefit for the Group and which can be reliably determined and measured. Both types of intangible assets undergo scheduled straight-line depreciation over their expected useful life. Production costs comprise all directly attributable costs as well as appropriate portions of the productionrelated overheads. Financing costs are not capitalised, since the Group does not have any assets which involve a protracted production/manufacturing phase. Other development costs are likewise not capitalised, since the conditions for capitalisation are not generally fulfilled. Intangible assets undergo impairment if the recoverable amount – the higher of the fair value less disposal costs and the asset's value in use – is less than the book value. Impairment is recognised under \"Amortisation of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment\". Proprietary intangible assets mainly comprise new developments in the field of distribution- and production-specific software systems which can be used throughout the Group.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nport 4 Remuneration\n\n→ Notes: B. Accounting and measurement principles\n\nIn case of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intangible assets which cannot be used yet, an impairment test is performed at least annually and in case of any indication of impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less disposal costs and the value in use.\n\nFor calculation of the value in use, the future cash flows resulting from continued use of the cash-generating units are discounted by a risk-adjusted interest rate. The cash flows are determined on the basis of the planning which has been approved by the Board of Management and is valid at the time of the impairment test. This planning is based on expectations of future market shares, growth on the respective markets and products' profitability. Cash flow forecasts beyond the detailed planning period are calculated on the basis of suitable growth rates. The planning period is five years. These include both the current market assessment regarding the fair value of the money and the risks to which the respective asset is exposed, if these factors have not already been reflected in the estimate of the cash flows. Before taxes, the risk-adjusted interest rates used for discounting of cash flows amount to between 5.7 % and 11.6 % in the Photofinishing business unit, to between 7.5 % and 9.2 % in the Retail business unit and to between 9.2 % and 12.2 % in the Commercial Online Printing business unit. The risk-adjusted interest rate for the cash-generating units is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is determined on the basis of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), with due consideration of current market expectations. Specific peer group information for beta factors, capital structure data and the cost of borrowing are used to calculate the risk-adjusted interest rate for the purpose of the impairment test. Periods not included in the planning are reflected by means of a terminal value. Various sensitivity analyses are also performed. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit falls below its book value, impairment is recognised in the amount of the difference. If the value in use is less than the book value, for the calculation of the recoverable amount the fair value less the disposal costs will also be determined.\n\nThe impairment loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss. In the event of a recovery of the impairment loss, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit will be increased to the newly determined recoverable amount. However, the increased book value may not exceed the book value which would have been determined (less scheduled depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous years. A recovery in value is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill does not undergo any scheduled amortisation and is tested for impairment on the basis of the recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit to which it has been assigned. For this purpose, the goodwill acquired through a merger will be assigned to each individual cash-generating unit which is expected to realise synergies as a result of the merger. The maximum size of the respective cash-generating unit corresponds to the operating business unit which is included in internal reporting submitted to the main decision-making entity and thus reflects the internal reporting structure. The impairment test is performed at least once a year and also in case of any indication of impairment of the cash-generating unit.\n\nIn the event that the book value of the cash-generating unit to which this goodwill has been assigned exceeds its recoverable amount, amortisation will be recognised on this assigned goodwill in the value of the difference determined. Goodwill amortisation already recognised may not be reversed. If the difference determined for the cash-generating unit exceeds the book value of the assigned goodwill, the book values of the assets assigned to the cash-generating unit will undergo pro rata impairment in the value of the remaining impairment loss.\n\n#### 14 Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets have been measured at fair value. CEWE reviews whether objective indications of impairment are applicable on each balance sheet date. Reinsurance policies included in financial assets are recognised at their actuarial present value. This does not involve plan assets.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes: B. Accounting and measurement principles\n\n#### 15 Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets held for sale comprise assets or groups of assets whose book values within the next twelve months are expected to be mainly realised through their disposal and not through their operational use. They are measured at the lower of their book value and their fair value less disposal costs. In the event of a subsequent increase in their fair value, a revaluation will be made in the value of the impairment recognised.\n\n#### 16 Inventories\n\nInventories are recognised at cost. Manufacturing costs include individual material and production costs as well as pro rata material and production overheads. Administrative costs are included where attributable to production. Acquired inventory items are measured on the basis of the average value method, at the weighted average value. If the net disposal value is lower on the balance sheet date, this will be recognised. Inventories rarely used due to obsoleteness or technical progress are subject to marketability discounts. The Group does not have any long-term production orders.\n\n#### 17 Primary financial instruments\n\nPrimary financial instruments comprise financial assets (receivables, other assets, loans extended and cash and cash equivalents) as well as financial liabilities (interest-bearing financial liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities). They are accounted for and measured in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9. A financial instrument is thus recognised if a consideration is provided in the form of cash and cash equivalents or financial assets. In principle, it will be recognised and written off at fair value, allowing for the transaction costs. Non-interest-bearing receivables and other assets are discounted if they are non-current. In accordance with IFRS 9, subsequent measurement will depend on the following categorisation of the financial instruments.\n\n#### **Financial assets**\n\nFinancial interests recognised as financial assets are measured at fair value, with changes in value recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn principle, loans and receivables not quoted on an active market are measured at amortised cost. This includes non-current financial receivables, trade receivables and other current financial receivables and assets. In case of any doubt regarding the collectability of individual receivables, they will be recognised at the lower realisable amount. Objective defaults will result in a write-off of the relevant receivable. Otherwise, receivables are measured according to the expected loss method. Foreign-currency receivables are translated at the exchange rate as of the reporting date.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash in hand and balances in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as of the reporting date.\n\n#### **Financial liabilities**\n\nFinancial liabilities regularly establish an obligation for delivery in the form of cash and cash equivalents or another financial asset. This includes, in particular, trade payables, amounts owed to credit institutions, derivative financial liabilities and other financial liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n\n#### 18 Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, combined interest rate and foreign currency swaps and commodities futures transactions for hedging of exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price risks are used within narrowly defined limits. In accordance with the Group's risk management principles, no derivative financial instruments are held for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently at their market value. Profit and loss are recognised on the basis of the type of position to be hedged. Recognised measurement models are used in order to determine the market value. Derivatives for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised at fair value.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n19 Deferred taxes In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary discrepancies in terms of assets and liabilities in the tax and IFRS balance sheets, for tax credits and loss carry-forwards and for consolidation measures recognised in profit or loss. The national tax rates applicable as of the balance sheet date or applicable in future will be used for calculation purposes. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognised as of the respective change in the law coming into effect. Deferred tax assets resulting from loss carry-forwards are only included insofar as their realisation is sufficiently concrete and probable. In principle, changes in deferred taxes recognised in the balance sheet will result in deferred tax expenses or income. Insofar as items resulting in changes to deferred taxes are directly entered against equity, the\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are shown within the scope of accruals. They are calculated on the basis of the standard international balance sheet-based liability method and show the tax effects resulting from the valuation differences between the tax balance sheets of the individual companies and the consolidated financial statements. Neither deferred tax assets nor deferred tax liabilities are discounted.\n\nchange in deferred taxes will also be directly recognised in equity.\n\nThe deferral amounts are calculated at the tax rates which may currently be expected in case of a reversal of the temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax receivables and liabilities will be netted if they apply in relation to the same tax authority.\n\n#### **Average tax rates for calculation of deferred taxes** in %\n\n|                 | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| Germany         | 32.00 | 31.00 |\n| Belgium         | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| Denmark         | 22.00 | 22.00 |\n| France          | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| United Kingdom  | 19.00 | 19.00 |\n| Netherlands     | 25.80 | 25.80 |\n| Norway          | 22.00 | 22.00 |\n| Austria         | 25.00 | 25.00 |\n| Poland          | 19.00 | 19.00 |\n| Sweden          | 20.60 | 20.60 |\n| Switzerland     | 23.00 | 23.00 |\n| Slovak Republic | 21.00 | 21.00 |\n| Czech Republic  | 19.00 | 21.00 |\n| Hungary         | 9.00  | 9.00  |\n| USA             | 21.00 | 21.00 |\n\n#### 20 Equity\n\nSubscribed capital is recognised within equity at its nominal value. The premium resulting from the first-time share issue is measured as a capital reserve on the basis of the difference between the nominal value of the ordinary bearer shares issued and the realised issue amount.\n\nThe subscribed capital and the capital reserve relate to CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and are recognised as if held by this company. Through the treasury shares item deducted from equity on the face of the balance sheet, treasury shares are reported as a deduction at the value of their full, original acquisition costs and incidental acquisition\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>136</sup>\n\n→ Notes: B.

As well as earnings calculated according to provisions of commercial law, these items include the discrepancies in relation to IFRS accounting standards. Effects resulting from the fair value measurement of equity instruments, hedging transactions and stock option plans (see item D 51, **[pages 159 ff.](#page-160-0)**) are also shown, as are the currency translation differences and actuarial gains and losses recognised directly in equity. The change in hidden reserves recognised within the scope of successive share purchases is apportioned to retained earnings.\n\n#### 21 Pension commitments\n\nPension accruals are calculated in accordance with the actuarial projected unit credit method prescribed in IAS 19 for defined-benefit pension obligations. The future obligation is discounted to its present value on the basis of the vested rights acquired up to the balance sheet date, while allowing for additional parameters. Discrepancies between estimates made and actual trends and changes in actuarial assumptions will result in actuarial gains and losses. These will be directly recognised in equity in the year of their occurrence. The current service cost and the interest expenses included in pension expenses are recognised in personnel expenses.\n\nThese figures only refer to the group of employees entitled to pensions for which a pension liability must be carried.\n\nThe biometric probabilities are calculated according to the current \"Heubeck reference tables 2018 G\" or similar foreign mortality tables. Reinsurance policies have been concluded to a minor extent for some of the reported pension commitments.\n\n#### 22 Accruals\n\nAccruals are established insofar as a legal or constructive obligation has resulted from a past event. This is subject to the requirement that this obligation is expected to lead to a future outflow of assets which can be reliably estimated. In case of a level of probability which is greater than 50 %, the respective item will be recognised on the basis of the settlement amount with the highest possible probability of realisation. Accruals for obligations which are not expected to already result in an outflow in the following year are recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected outflow, if such accruals are significant. The discount rates correspond to the normal capital market rates. The value of the accruals is reviewed on each balance sheet date.\n\n#### 23 Share-based payment\n\nIFRS 2 is complied with in respect of the balance-sheet treatment of stock option plans. The fair value of the options as of the grant date is determined upon the basis of market prices (prices of Deutsche Börse AG, Frankfurt) with consideration of the terms of issue as well as generally recognised valuation techniques for financial instruments. The exercise price, the respective term, the current market value of the option instrument (the CEWE share), the expected level of volatility for the market price, the expected dividends on the shares and the risk-free interest rate for the terms of the options are included for the purpose of this valuation. Moreover, as specific requirements for the exercise of the option the beneficiaries comply with the necessary waiting period (lockup period) and, where applicable, exercise the option as early as possible. In the following financial reporting, the determined value of the stock options is apportioned to the term as expense, with consideration of the assumed service period and the level of fluctuation in the beneficiaries. Option premiums received within the scope of the options issued are recognised in retained earnings.\n\n#### 24 Research and non-capitalisable development costs\n\nResearch and non-capitalisable development costs are recognised in profit or loss at the time of their occurrence.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n→ Notes:\n\n```\nB.

Contingent liabilities may also result from a present obligation which is attributable to past events but has not been recognised in the balance sheet because\n\n- the outflow of resources providing an economic benefit upon fulfilment of this obligation is not probable or\n- the value of this obligation cannot be estimated sufficiently reliably.\n\nIf the outflow of resources providing an economic benefit for the company is not probable, no contingent liability will be disclosed.\n\nContingent assets are not shown in the balance sheet and will only be indicated if the accrual of an economic benefit is probable. They include possible assets which result from past events and whose existence on account of the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events – over which the company lacks complete control – is yet to be confirmed.\n\n#### 26 Government grants\n\nGovernment grants which are paid by way of compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or by way of immediate financial support, without related future expense, are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account in the period in which the relevant entitlement arises.\n\n## C.

Retrospectively applicable discounts are frequently agreed here which are based upon the overall turnover within a given period. The proceeds from these sales are recognised at the price stated in the contract, less the agreed discounts. A reimbursement liability (reported under trade payables) is recognised for discounts which are expected to be payable to the customer for sales completed up to the end of the reporting period. Sales via mailorder shipping are recognised in Photofinishing and Commercial Online Printing, mainly on the basis of prepayment. The retail stores operated by CEWE sell photographic hardware as well as photofinishing products. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately upon the customer's purchase of the product and acceptance of delivery in the retail store. Other revenues which have not resulted from the delivery or provision of typical goods, merchandise and services (the ordinary activities of the CEWE Group) are shown as other operating income. As of the reporting date, there are no contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised asset or services to the customer and the payment made by the customer is greater than one year. Accordingly, the promised consideration has not been restated on the basis of the time value of money.\n\n### 28 Other operating income\n\n#### **Other operating income** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                 | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rental income                                   | 3,808  | 4,159  |\n| Other revenues from sales to third parties      | 6,969  | 4,145  |\n| Income from pass-through expenses               | 3,604  | 3,258  |\n| Income from currency translation                | 2,425  | 2,429  |\n| Reimbursement of costs own personnel            | 1,384  | 2,334  |\n| Income from the reversal of accruals            | 3,689  | 2,012  |\n| Income from default charges                     | 757    | 760    |\n| Income from the receipt of impaired receivables | 1,461  | 426    |\n| Income from insurance indemnification           | 96     | 188    |\n| Additional other operating income               | 4,964  | 5,783  |\n| Total other operating income                    | 29,157 | 25,494 |\n\nOther revenues from sales to third parties comprise revenues from sales of aluminium from the resale of the printing plates used in offset printing and revenue from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn particular, income from pass-through expenses includes passed-on charges for sales aids, advertising services and logistics and other transport services.\n\nIncome from the release of accruals comprises various individual items within the scope of ordinary activities.

Reserves are entered for them in equity. On the structure of the stock option plans, we refer to the comments regarding the Group's equity (see item D 51, **[pages 159 ff.](#page-160-0)**). A Monte Carlo simulation has been used for these measurements. A log-normal distribution-based process has been simulated for the price of the CEWE share so as to map the performance target in the form of an increase in the average closing price on the underlying price on ten consecutive trading days.\n\nThe simulations also included the possibility of early exercise – with due consideration of the respective exercise windows – and also the beneficiaries' early exercise behaviour, in line with a modified version of the approach proposed by Hull and White. The simulation assumed that, upon expiry of the lockup period, every year through a 3.00 % exit rate stock options are exercised immediately upon this becoming possible due to the beneficiary leaving the company. A risk-free interest rate was assumed for the period up to the key date of December 30 of the relevant year. The calculation used discrete dividends; publicly available estimates were used as the basis for calculation. Finally, the historical level of volatility was considered and recognised for December 30 of the current year. The Group did not make any direct support payments.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\ntments\n\nO Particle\n\n→ Notes: C.

The scheduled depreciations indicated here and the non-scheduled depreciations of fixed assets are shown in the profit and loss account under amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. On the basis of impairment tests, non-scheduled depreciation on equipment with limited usability for technical reasons has been recognised in the amount of 1,209 thousand euros (previous year: 45 thousand euros).\n\nThe book value of property, plant and equipment used only temporarily is of lesser importance. The same applies for property, plant and equipment which is definitively no longer used. It is assumed that the fair value of property, plant and equipment does not significantly deviate from its book value. The Group does not have any pledged property, plant and equipment. Obligations for the purchase of property, plant and equipment (commitments) amount to 9,532 thousand euros (previous year: 17,943 thousand euros).\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration | 5 Financial Statements | 6 Further

In accordance with IAS 40, these buildings no longer used by the Group are measured at amortised cost. The underlying expected useful lives for scheduled straight-line depreciation are between 25 and 50 years. Additions in the financial year relate to subsequent acquisition costs in the amount of 317 thousand euros (previous year: 2,419 thousand euros). In the financial year, rent income amounted to 2,512 thousand euros (previous year: 2,440 thousand euros). Including depreciation, maintenance and incidental costs, expenses for the leased properties amounted to 2,046 thousand euros (previous year: 1,668 thousand euros).\n\nThe fair value of these investment properties is 26,574 thousand euros (previous year: 30,173 thousand euros).

Within the scope of the impairment test, the recoverable amount is determined by calculating the value in use. Cash flow forecasts are used for this purpose which are based on the approved business planning figures. In the detailed planning period for the main items of goodwill, an average annual rate of turnover growth of approx. 5.5 % (previous year: 5.8 %) is assumed in the Photofinishing business unit and 4.8 % (previous year: 8.2 %) in the Commercial Online Printing business unit. Cash flows are extrapolated beyond a period of five years on the basis of the growth\n\nrates indicated below. The planning is based on past experience, the current performance of the business and the best possible estimates of key trends affecting individual factors such as the development of procurement prices or market growth.\n\nIn the following, the long-term growth rate and discount rate is indicated for the valuein-use calculation for each cash-generating unit with significant goodwill.

Nonetheless, revised assumptions or changed circumstances may necessitate corrections which may lead to additional valuation adjustments or, in case of a reversal in the envisaged trends, reversals in value if this does not involve goodwill.\n\nWithin the scope of a sensitivity analysis for cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been assigned, a 10 % reduction in EBIT margins for the perpetual annuity and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate have been assumed. For the cash-generating unit DeinDesign, an increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 409 thousand euros impairment of the book value for goodwill. For the cash-generating unit Cheerz, an increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 1,761 thousand euros impairment of the book value for goodwill. On this basis, no impairment requirement applies for the cash-generating units or for the group of cash-generating units.\n\n## 39 Intangible assets\n\nSoftware and similar industrial property rights comprise purchased ERP software, various office products for workstations and newly and subsequently capitalised items for proprietary intangible assets, for internal use and to support the market in the areas of production, distribution and Commercial Online Printing. Within the scope of the Group's proprietary software, own work has been capitalised at a value of 596 thousand euros (previous year: 518 thousand euros).\n\nOn the basis of impairment tests, non-scheduled amortisation reflecting new information has been recognised in the amount of 757 thousand euros on acquired software (Photofinishing business unit) and 29 thousand euros (Commercial Online Printing business unit) on internally generated intangible assets (previous year: 14 thousand euros (Commercial Online Printing business unit)).\n\nFor intangible assets, the Group had commitments in the amount of 510 thousand euros (previous year: 936 thousand euros).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Acquisition and production costs**\n\n**Depreciation**\n\n| 1 CEWE at a Glance | 2 To the Shareholders | 3 Combined Management Report | 4 Remuneration | 5 Financial Statements | 6 Further Information |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n\n→ Notes: D.

Direct losses on trade receivables are also shown in the other operating expenses item; in the past financial year, they amounted to 466 thousand euros (previous year: 407 thousand euros).\n\nCEWE applies the simplified approach according to IFRS 9 in order to measure the expected credit losses; accordingly, the credit losses envisaged over the course of the period are taken into consideration for all trade receivables. In order to measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are aggregated on the basis of common credit risk characteristics and the number of days overdue. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles for turnover over a period of 36 months prior to December 31, 2022 and the related historical losses in this period. The historical loss rates are restated in order to reflect current and prospective information which affects customers' capacity to settle claims. In the past financial year, customer receivables of CEWE Norge AS, Oppegård, Norway, with a book value of 138 thousand euros (previous year: 95 thousand euros) were pledged. They will be finally written off once the write-off rules under IFRS 9 are fulfilled.\n\nThis mainly comprises refund claims for tax prepayments made in the current year for the year under review.\n\n## 46 Current financial assets\n\nCurrent financial assets include the following items:\n\n#### **Current financial assets** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Creditors with debit accounts                  | 345           | 283           |\n| Receivables from employees                     | 315           | 355           |\n| Other current financial receivables and assets | 2,462         | 2,536         |\n| Total                                          | 3,122         | 3,174         |\n\n#### 47 Other current receivables and assets\n\n#### **Other current receivables and assets** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                          | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Current prepaid expenses                 | 6,548         | 7,057         |\n| Tax refund claims                        | 5,354         | 5,193         |\n| Current receivables from insurance firms | 0             | 12            |\n| Total                                    | 11,902        | 12,262        |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n5 Financial Statements 6 Further\n\n→ Notes: D.

Comments on the balance sheet\n\nAll of these plans have the same structure. Each of these stock option plans has a term of five years. Upon expiry of a four-term waiting period (lockup period), the options may be exercised in the fifth year of the term. Their exercise is contingent upon achievement of the performance target, i.e. if the closing auction prices of the CEWE share in Deutsche Börse AG's Xetra trading system have at least reached (if not exceeded) the underlying price plus the applicable performance premium on ten consecutive stock exchange trading days.\n\nThe options are only exercisable and shares resulting from the option deal are only subsequently saleable within six four-week exercise periods. These exercise periods will begin as of publication of the earnings for the past financial year, as of the balance sheet The terms of the current stock option plans are as follows: press conference, as of the annual general meeting and as of the date of publication of\n\n#### **Structure of stock option plans**\n\n#### the quarterly figures.

KGaA as well as other Group companies in Germany and other countries, at a premium of 0.50 euros per option. The number of options offered is limited. A maximum of 1,200 options are available for a member of the Board of Management, while for other executives and experts a lower number of options are available, depending on their management level and their proximity to the company's success.\n\nThe terms of the current stock option plans are as follows:\n\n|          |                      | Number of<br>participants | Number of<br>rights issued | Start of<br>waiting period | End of<br>waiting period | End of<br>exercise period | Underlying price<br>euros/option | Performance<br>premium<br>in % | Performance<br>target<br>euros/option |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| SOP 2023 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2024               | Dec. 31, 2027            | Dec. 31, 2028             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 27                        | 20,250                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 34                        | 28,650                     |                            |                          |                           | 87.00                            | 120                            | 104.40                                |\n| SOP 2022 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2023               | Dec. 31, 2026            | Dec. 31, 2027             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 76.00                            | 120                            | 91.20                                 |\n| SOP 2021 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2022               | Dec. 31, 2025            | Dec. 31, 2026             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 121.00                           | 120                            | 145.20                                |\n| SOP 2019 | Board of Management1 | 7                         | 8,400                      | Jan. 1, 2020               | Dec. 31, 2023            | Dec. 31, 2024             |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Other executives     | 26                        | 19,500                     |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n|          | Total                | 33                        | 27,900                     |                            |                          |                           | 81.00                            | 125                            | 101.25                                |\n|          |                      |                           |                            |                            |                          |                           |                                  |                                |                                       |\n\n**1** Board of Management of Neumüller CEWE COLOR Stiftung\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6.

KGaA (415 thousand euros) and the profit from the sale of treasury shares (12,689 thousand euros).\n\nThe capital reserve includes the fair value of the stock options issued for the stock plans which have been added to the capital reserve pro rata between the issue date and the maturity of the stock option plans, plus the withheld premiums.

The company's pension scheme is based on a defined-benefit system and also, to a marginal extent, on a defined-contribution system. Employees are also able to participate in schemes for the conversion of salary entitlements into pension entitlements. Accruals are measured on the basis of the projected unit credit method.\n\nIn the case of the defined-benefit scheme, the company or an external pension provider grants the beneficiaries a defined-benefit commitment; unlike in the case of defined contributions, the expenses incurred by the company are not determined in advance. In Germany, the company's commitments to the Board of Management are structured as final salary plans; in addition, several executives have been granted fixed-benefit commitments. In France, capital commitments in accordance with the employee's period of service are granted. Until 2021, these were in some cases covered by reinsurance policies. Expenses for these commitments are apportioned across the service period of the employees, on the basis of actuarial calculations, and must be broken down into the current service cost and interest expense (the balance of interest on the obligation and income from the cover funds) in accordance with IAS 19. On the respective balance sheet date (December 31 of each year), the interest rate is determined on the basis of current capital market data as well as assumptions regarding long-term trends, in accordance with the principle of the best possible estimate. CEWE has several defined-benefit plans. As a rule, it has provided aggregated details for these plans, since there are no significant deviations in terms of their respective risk exposure. Through its plans in Germany and France, the Group is generally exposed to the following actuarial risks: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.\n\nInvestment risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is calculated by means of a discount rate which is determined on the basis of the yields provided by high-quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds. If the income from the plan assets is less than this interest rate, this will result in shortage of cover for the plan.\n\nInterest rate risk: a decrease in the discount rate will result in an increase in the Group's liability under the plan.\n\nLongevity risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is determined on the basis of the best possible estimate of the probability of death of the beneficiary employees, both during the employment relationship and thereafter. An increase in the life expectancy of beneficiary employees will result in an increase in the liability under the plan.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\nSalary risk: the present value of the defined-benefit obligation under the plan is determined Overall, the Group's financing status is as follows: on the basis of the future salaries of beneficiary employees. An increase in the salaries of beneficiary employees will thus result in an increase in the liability under the plan.\n\nNo other benefits for these employees are envisaged upon termination of their employment relationships.\n\nThe company does not have any plan assets within the meaning of IAS 19 to cover these benefits in any of the countries in question.\n\nOn the other hand, in case of defined contributions firmly defined contributions (e.g. in relation to the applicable level of income) are confirmed and paid.

As of the reporting date, the loans taken up have a term of between one and one and a half years (previous year: between one and two and a half years). At the end of the year, the total credit line of the CEWE Group amounted to 91.0 million euros (previous year: 153.0 million euros); this decrease is attributable to the repayment according to schedule of lines of credit no longer required on a long-term basis. After deducting the total loan volume drawn down (0.87 million euros, previous year: 0.84 million euros) – this does not involve a drawdown which is relevant for liquidity purposes and instead comprises the amount deducted by the credit institutions for the guarantees provided – and allowing for the company's existing liquidity (117.37 million euros, previous year: 73.07 million euros), its liquidity potential totalled 207.50 million euros (previous year: 225.23 million euros). The company has long-term revolving credit lines which have been granted for up to 1.5 years as well as continuously renewed one-year lines and lines of credit made available until further notice whose overall purpose is financing of the company's liquidity requirements, which fluctuate strongly over the course of a given year due to seasonal factors. In principle, no restrictions apply in relation to the use of credit lines. This ensures that CEWE will be able to fulfil its payment obligations.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll long-term credit commitments are subject to normal bank agreements. No financial covenants have been agreed. No significant collateral was provided. The interest terms for current account loans are based on €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany; the interest terms for almost all of the other financing arrangements are based on the one- to three-month EURIBOR as the base interest rate plus a normal margin in Germany.

In particular, these risks comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit risks. The Group's management manages and limits these risks. They are monitored by means of the Group-wide risk management system.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of the Group being unable to fulfil its financial obligations. This risk is dealt with by means of liquidity planning and cash management, through continuous monitoring and management of cash inflows and outflows. The main sources of liquidity are operating business and external financing. Cash outflows are mainly used for financing of working capital and investments.\n\nOf these credit lines, as of the reporting date 90.1 million euros (previous year: 152.2 million euros) have not been drawn down. As well as cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 117.4 million euros (previous year: 73.1 million euros), this amount is available for coverage of future liquidity requirements.

Currency risks result from turnover billed in a currency other than that of the related costs, the foreign-currency assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet whose fair value may be negatively influenced by a change in exchange rates and from pending foreign-currency transactions whose future cash flows may have a negative effect due to exchange rate changes. The risk management system continuously monitors the risk positions resulting from currency risks. To limit these risks, outside the scope of deliveries and services where possible the Group reduces the volume of euro-denominated transactions for companies in non-Eurozone countries. Following a detailed review process, the company enters into non-euro hedging transactions with its house banks on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe key market risk in the foreign-currency segment relates to currency positions which were open as of the reporting date. The Group's Swiss, Czech and British companies have significant foreign-currency items. For the purpose of the sensitivity analysis, the corresponding foreign-currency items are measured at hypothetical exchange rates. If these three foreign currencies were to depreciate against the euro by 20 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Currency sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets      | -40,670 | -80,192 |\n| Financial liabilities | 25,262  | 50,262  |\n\nIf these three foreign currencies were to appreciate against the euro by 20 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:):\n\n#### **Currency sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                       | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets      | -21,725 | -43,171 |\n| Financial liabilities | 31,997  | 63,124  |\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\nFinancial Statements 6 Further Information\n\n→ Notes: D. Comments on the balance sheet\n\nThe CEWE Group does not have any particularly significant exposure to interest rate risks in relation to third parties. Interest-rate-sensitive assets comprise loans to customers and employees as well as current balances held by credit institutions. CEWE does not have any interest-rate-sensitive financial liabilities as of the balance sheet date. No significant risk positions have resulted on account of the current interest rate trend. The goal of CEWE's interest rate hedging strategy is the regular conclusion of new medium- to longterm credit agreements with fixed interest rates. If the interest rates for variable interest-rate financial assets and financial liabilities were in each case to fall by 10 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                  | 2022 | 2023  |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Interest income  | -4.3 | -51.2 |\n| Interest expense | 44.8 | 45.8  |\n\nIf the interest rates for variable interest-rate financial assets and financial liabilities were in each case to increase by 10 %, the following opportunities (positive values) or risks (negative values) would result:\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity** in thousands of euros\n\n|                  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n| Interest income  | 4.3   | 51.2  |\n| Interest expense | -44.8 | -45.8 |\n\nNo hedging transactions have been entered into.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, financial assets measured at amortised cost resulted in net income/losses of 40 thousand euros (previous year: 42 thousand euros). Net income/ losses resulting from the financial instruments held comprise, in particular, valuation adjustments, income from written-down receivables and the results of the fair value measurement. Dividend income and interest are not included. Net income/losses resulting from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost amount to 1,946 thousand euros in the financial year 2023 (previous year: 1,544 thousand euros).\n\nInterest income associated with financial instruments not measured in profit and loss at fair value amounts to 512 thousand euros (previous year: 43 thousand euros), while corresponding interest expenses amount to 79 thousand euros (previous year: 39 thousand euros). Impairment of financial instruments measured at amortised cost amounted to 466 thousand euros in the past financial year (previous year: 407 thousand euros); this was recognised due to depreciation of receivables.\n\nInterest expense from lease liabilities is also included in the financial year, in the amount of 1,488 thousand euros (previous year: 1,094 thousand euros) (item C33, **[page 143](#page-144-0)**).\n\nThe reconciliation of the balance sheet items with these types of financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 is as

amortised cost; FVTOCI: at fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: at fair value through profit or loss\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets not measured in accordance with IFRS 9 comprise reinsurance policies. They are recognised at their actuarial present value. The book values of the other financial assets, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and the book values of current account liabilities, trade payables and other current financial liabilities each serve as a reasonable approximation of the respective fair values. This is mainly due to the short terms of these instruments. Risk-related valuation adjustments are considered for the calculation of book values. The Group does not have any financial receivables or liabilities held for trading purposes.\n\nCEWE measures fixed-interest and variable-interest receivables with a remaining term of more than one year on the basis of various parameters, e.g. the interest rate and the borrower's credit rating. On the basis of this measurement, any necessary valuation adjustments are included in the calculation of the book value. A fixed-interest agreement applies for current and non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities (with the exception of current account liabilities), so that here too the book value corresponds to the fair value.\n\nBook values are determined by means of normal bank methods.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations, resulting in a bad debt loss. In some cases and to a not insignificant degree, factoring is used as an instrument to minimise the credit risk. Within the scope of the Group's receivables management system, as a component of its risk management system, receivables at the level of the individual companies are subject to comprehensive monthly analysis and are notified to the Group's central management, at the level of its headquarters, as part of its del credere reporting. Loan security agreements are concluded for medium-size and major customers. If the Group does not have any insurance cover or if a deductible is applicable, individual valuation adjustments are recognised on receivables in case of objective indications that it is overwhelmingly probable that this receivable is uncollectable, either in whole or in part. The general default risk is dealt with by means of individual valuation adjustments on the basis of past experience. On December 31, 2023, the maximum credit risk resulting from debtors' potential insolvency in relation to loans and receivables amounted to 95,137 thousand euros (previous year: 102,248 thousand euros) and has the following makeup:\n\n#### **Credit risk** in thousands of euros\n\nD.

Comments on the balance sheet\n\nThese items are very closely monitored within the scope of the Group's receivables management system. On the basis of an assessment of the individual risks, partial valuation adjustments in the amounts indicated above are sufficient. Non-impaired financial assets are considered to be recoverable. Default risks are reduced by means of continuous monitoring of customers' credit ratings and payment behaviour, in close coordination with the company's market-oriented departments, and are covered by means of insurance, where possible. Moreover, in case of irregularities in customer relationships the volume of business is managed on the basis of individual decisions. Impairment of consumer receivables is minimised by means of a professional debt collection management system as well as risk avoidance and information-gathering parameters. These automatic system settings and the additional qualitative information serves as information which is used for calculation of individual valuation allowances.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, the BEPS Pillar 2 rules (German Act Transposing the Minimum Tax Directive, Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – MinBestRL-UmsG) were transposed into German law (German Act on Minimum Taxation, Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG) and entered into force upon publication in the German Federal Law Gazette on December 27, 2023. The provisions of the Act on Minimum Taxation apply for the first time for financial years beginning after December 30, 2023 and are therefore not yet applicable for the year under review. Even if these provisions had already been applicable, the CEWE Group would not have fallen under the scope of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation either in the year under review or in the financial year 2024, since the turnover threshold of 750 million euros in the consolidated financial statements for application of these provisions was exceeded for the first time in the year under review. This notwithstanding, CEWE expects to once again exceed the relevant turnover threshold in the financial year 2024 and thus assumes that the provisions of the MinStG will apply for the first time for the financial year 2025.\n\nIn the financial year 2024, the CEWE Group will therefore commence a project reviewing the impact in terms of the effects associated with a Pillar 2 top-up tax. It is not currently possible to quantity the potential additional tax burden. However, application of the MinStG or foreign acts on minimum taxation are not currently expected to lead to a significant additional tax burden, since the CEWE Group operates almost exclusively in countries whose nominal income tax burden exceeds 15 % and for which no tax burden at all, or only an insignificant tax burden, is therefore expected to arise.\n\nThe CEWE Group is closely monitoring the progress of the legislative process in every country where it operates. It will adapt its current reporting and compliance processes with a view to future local and central determination of the top-up tax burden as well as the future submission of a minimum tax report and filing of related tax returns in Germany and other countries.\n\nThe key equity items are presented below. Net interest-bearing financial liabilities have resulted from netting of gross interest-bearing financial liabilities against the Group's cash and cash equivalents as of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Key equity items** in thousands of euros\n\n|                                                    | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total assets                                       | 632,706       | 665,963       |\n| Equity                                             | 362,763       | 389,239       |\n| Equity ratio (as %)                                | 57.3          | 58.4          |\n| Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | 116           | 0             |\n| Non-current liabilities from leasing               | 40,536        | 37,103        |\n| Current interest-bearing financial liabilities     | 214           | 77            |\n| Current liabilities from leasing                   | 9,717         | 9,468         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 73,067        | 117,369       |\n| Net interest-bearing financial liabilities         | -22,484       | -70,721       |\n\nThe primary goal of the CEWE Group's capital management system is to ensure that the Group remains capable of repaying its debts and maintains its financial resources. As well as safeguarding the long-term liquidity supply, the interest rate risk has been limited and a flexible credit structure has once again been maintained, to cover the seasonal nature of the Group's business performance over the course of the year.

Other disclosures\n\nThe cash flow statement shows how the Group's cash and cash equivalents have developed during the financial years 2023 and 2022. In accordance with IAS 7, this statement distinguishes between cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents shown comprise the balance sheet items bank balances with a remaining term of up to three months and cash in hand including fixed deposit balances. This corresponds to the cash and cash equivalents item presented in the balance sheet.\n\nThe potential effects of the continued inflation and the related impact on CEWE's course of business have been factored into the forecast, opportunities and risk report on the basis of the information currently available.\n\nIn order to further increase its depth of added value, at the start of the financial year 2024 CEWE's subsidiary SAXOPRINT acquired assets of Eastprint GmbH, Dresden, via an asset deal. SAXOPRINT had previously outsourced large-format printing to Eastprint. This has now been brought in house through this acquisition. No other events of particular significance have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n## 70 Events of particular significance after the balance sheet date\n\n71 Comments on the cash flow statement\n\nThe inflows and outflows resulting from the change in financial liabilities are attributable to repayments, reclassifications due to maturity periods and loans taken up as follows:\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2023** in thousands of euros\n\n|               | Current interest- bearing<br>financial liabilities | Non-current interest-<br>bearing financial liabilities | Gross financial<br>liabilities |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| As of Jan. 1  | 214                                                | 116                                                    | 330                            |\n| Repayment     | -137                                               | -116                                                   | -253                           |\n| As of Dec. 31 | 77                                                 | -0                                                     | 77                             |\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2022** in thousands of euros\n\n|               | Current interest-bearing financial liabilities | Non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities | Gross financial liabilities |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| As of Jan. 1  | 276                                            | 407                                                | 683                         |\n| Repayment     | -62                                            | -291                                               | -353                        |\n| As of Dec. 31 | 214                                            | 116                                                | 330                         |\n\n#### 72 Other financial obligations under lease agreements\n\nLeases and tenancies exist which constitute operating lease arrangements in terms of their economic content, so that the leasing assets are attributable to the lessor rather than CEWE Stiftung & Co.

In accordance with the internal reporting, revenues are reported according to consolidation effects.\n\nTurnover corresponds to the breakdown by geographical region shown in section C27, **[pages 138 f](#page-139-0)**.\n\nThese turnover categories are Photofinishing revenue, Retail revenue and revenue from Commercial Online Printing. A breakdown of these categories is provided in the segment reporting by business unit.

KGaA, Oldenburg\n\n### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\n#### **Audit Opinions**\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, and its subsidiaries (the group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2023, the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn addition, we have audited the combined management report (report on the position of the company and the group) of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the combined management report listed in section \"Other information\".\n\nThe combined management report includes references not required by law which have been marked as unaudited. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited these references or the information to which these references relate.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the group as at December 31, 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and\n\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of those parts of the Combined management report listed in section \"Other information\". The combined management report includes references not required by law which have been marked as unaudited. Our audit opinion does not include these references or the information to which these references relate.\n\nPursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nl Statements 6 Further\n\n6 Further Information\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have identified the following matters as key audit matters which must be mentioned in our auditor's report:\n\n- 1. REALISATION OF TURNOVER IN THE PHOTOFINISHING SEGMENT\n- 2. FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IN THE COMMERCIAL ONLINE PRINTING AND PHOTOFINISHING BUSINESS UNITS\n\n#### Realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment\n\n#### **Specific issue**\n\nIn its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, the company has reported revenues in its Photofinishing segment in the amount of 659 million euros (84.4 % of total revenues). Due to the highly automated procedure through which these revenues are realised, the very large volume of data processed and the variety of IT systems due to the diverse product range, in our view particularly stringent requirements apply for the IT systems in terms of correct recognition of and accrual accounting for revenues. In view of this situation, the IT systems were particularly significant for us within the scope of our audit, in relation to the realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment.\n\nThe disclosures made by CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA concerning revenues in the Photofinishing segment may be found in section \"C27\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Audit response**\n\nTo address the risk associated with the realisation of turnover in the Photofinishing segment, we have performed uniform audit procedures for all of the segments. We have assessed implementation of the Group rules on the realisation of turnover in the IT\n\nsystems in terms of whether the software in question is suitable to appropriately map the business transactions. As well as a basic audit, our audit approach includes functionbased testing of relevant check mechanisms as well as ad hoc and analytical audit procedures. In particular, we have evaluated whether the IT control system has been appropriately designed for the IT systems used throughout the Group for invoicing and their interfaces in relation to the relevant general ledger. To review the effectiveness of this IT control system, we have implemented control tests for the control activities implemented within the scope of these processes. We have consulted internal specialists in relation to these audit activities. We have also established on a sample basis that the accrual accounting for revenues has been correctly implemented.\n\n#### Fair value of goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing and Photofinishing business units\n\n#### **Specific issue**\n\nIn its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, the company has reported goodwill in the amount of 22.16 million euros in its Commercial Online Printing business unit and 59.62 million euros in its Photofinishing business unit.\n\nThe company tests goodwill for impairment once a year or on an ad hoc basis in order to determine a possible write-down requirement. In the financial year 2023 the company performed the annual impairment test.\n\nThis impairment test is carried out at the level of cash-generating units to which the respective goodwill is allocated. Within the scope of this impairment test, the book value of the respective cash-generating unit is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount. In principle, the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use. As a rule, the valuation is implemented on the basis of the present value of future cash flows for the respective cash-generating unit. The values in use are determined by means of the discounted cash flow method, in line with the Group's approved planning. Future cash flows beyond the detailed planning period are carried forward on the basis of long-term growth rates. Expectations regarding the future market trend and assumptions relating to the development of macroeconomic factors are taken into consideration here. Discounting is implemented by means of the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating unit.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nanalyses.\n\ntion and have checked the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and the model used. We have discussed with the Board of Management the Group's approved planning and the current forecast as well as the assumed long-term growth rates. We have developed an understanding of the underlying planning assumptions and the related growth rate assumptions by comparing them with past trends and current industry-specific market expectations. We have also critically examined the discount rates applied on the basis of the average cost of capital of a peer group. Our audit included the company's sensitivity\n\nWithin the scope of our audit, we have obtained an understanding of the planning process and have assessed its appropriateness. We have carried out an analysis of past planning and compared the planning of the past few years with the actual results and analysed any discrepancies. Moreover, with the assistance of our valuation specialists we have developed an understanding of the impairment testing method applied as well as the calcula-\n\n**Audit response**\n\nDisclosures from CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA on goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing business unit may be found in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: A4 Consolidation principles, B6 General disclosures, B11 Goodwill, B13 Impairment, D. Comments on the balance sheet (development of the fixed assets) and D38 Goodwill.\n\nunit, the discount rates applied, the growth rates as well as further assumptions and is thus subject to considerable uncertainty. In this context and, in particular, in view of the uncertainty relating to course of business and the earnings trend in the light of the coronavirus pandemic, the fair value of goodwill in the Commercial Online Printing business unit was a particularly significant issue for our audit.\n\nThe calculation of the respective value in use is highly dependent on the company's legal representatives' assessment of the future cash inflows for the respective cash-generating\n\nThe executive directors or the supervisory board are responsible for the other\n\nreport\n\n**Other Information**\n\n• the separate consolidated non-financial report, published on the company's website,\n\n- to which reference is made in the \"Reports on the company's management\" section of the combined management report\n- the declaration on corporate governance contained in the \"Reports on the company's management\" section of the combined management report\n- the remaining parts of the annual report, with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and combined management report and our auditor's report.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and thereby acknowledge whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## <sup>1</sup> **[CEWE at a Glance](#page-1-0)** <sup>2</sup> **[To the Shareholders](#page-12-0)** <sup>3</sup> **[Combined Management Report](#page-52-0)** <sup>4</sup> **[Remuneration](#page-98-0)** <sup>5</sup> **[Financial Statements](#page-118-0)** <sup>6</sup> **[Further Information](#page-197-0)** <sup>190</sup>\n\n→ Independent auditor's\n\ninformation. The other information comprises:\n\n1 CEWE at a Glance\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined management report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i. e. manipulations of the accounting and asset damage) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined management report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nlders 3 Combined Management Report\n\nReport 4 Remuneration\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards implemented to address any threats to independence. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinions.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i. e. whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documentation meets the require-ments of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the technical specification for this electronic file applicable at the reporting date.\n- Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n#### **Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the consolidated general meeting on June 7, 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on November 9, 2023. We have been the group auditor of the CEWE Stiftung & Co.

KGaA business group (hereinafter CEWE) complies with the duty to disclose non-financial information for the financial year 2023 in accordance with Secs. 315b and 315c HGB in conjunction with Secs. 289c to 289e HGB. The separate consolidated non-financial report has been consolidated with the separate consolidated non-financial report of the parent company in accordance with Sec. 289b HGB. It is incorporated into the annual report and refers to the GRI Standards (Sec. 289d HGB) as its framework. The separate consolidated nonfinancial report was reviewed and released by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board assessed the separate consolidated non-financial report for its legality, reliability and appropriateness.\n\n#### **Business model**\n\nCEWE is active in three strategic business units: Photofinishing, Commercial Online Printing and Retail. The locations and distribution offices are spread to 26 countries across Europe. Buyers and recipients include retail stores, consumers and trade professionals. The mandatory information pertaining to the business model are detailed in this annual report from **[page 52 f.](#page-53-0)** onwards.\n\n#### **Relevance of sustainability**\n\nSustainability has been enshrined within the Board of Management since 2008 and has been governed by Thomas Mehls since 2016, who oversees Sustainability, Marketing and New Business Units on the Board of Management. He governs sustainability together with two area managers and in co-ordination with the Sustainability Task Force **[Sustainability](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [Report 2023, page 17](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. CEWE greatly values sustainable governance across all sectors and has included all areas in its sustainability activities **[Sustainability Report 2023, pages 17 and](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [21 f.](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)** Sustainability management thus forms an integral part of corporate governance within the organisation. The strategy is rooted in five dimensions: honest and fair conduct, economic viability, environmental protection and resource conservation, responsibility for employees and social commitment **[Sustainability Report 2023, page 17](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**.\n\n#### **Process to establish material non-financial topics according to the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)**\n\nWhen assessing aspects that concern the separate consolidated non-financial report, CEWE was guided by the material topics of sustainability in accordance with the 2020 version of the materiality analysis. **[Sustainability Report 2023 pages 21 f.](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)** CEWE conducted a comprehensive stakeholder survey in 2020 for this, which once again serves as the basis for this year's separate consolidated non-financial report **[Sustainability Report 2023 page 21](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. The aspects were reviewed once again in preparation of this report with regard to the materiality requirements under the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). Comments from the auditing process of the previous reporting year were consulted. It was explored whether the details are necessary to understand the business performance, the business result, the company's position as well as the understanding of the impact of the company's activities on non-financial aspects.\n\nAn internal review has established that the current material topics continue to be relevant for CEWE. These are currently being further specified as part of the adjustments to the double materiality in accordance with the future requirements of the ESRS. In conclusion, the strategic priorities from the materiality matrix were attributed to concerns according to CSR-RUG, notably Climate Protection as well as Materials and Waste (Environmental), Responsible Use of Technology (Social) and Sustainable Products (Products). Moreover, the following topics from the materiality matrix were attributed to concerns which the CSR-RUG rates as material: Good Employer (Employee Rights), Sustainable Supply Chain (Human Rights), Fair Working Practices (Anti-Corruption and Bribery). Other topics from the materiality matrix were not deemed to be material according to CSR-RUG.\n\nCEWE plans to conduct new stakeholder surveys at regular intervals to establish if the defined topics remain relevant. A new stakeholder survey was originally planned for 2023. However, due to the changed legal situation for the 2024 report, this was postponed in order to implement the adjustment to the double materiality analysis in accordance with the CSRD.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe outcome from the risk assessment is summarised on **[pages 37 and 38 of the Sustainability](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)  [Report](https://company.cewe.de/en/sustainability/sustainability-reports.html)**. In line with Secs. 289c (3), 3 and 4 and 315c (2) HGB, no material risks were identified, neither in relation to its own business activities or its business relationships, nor for products and services in terms of non-financial aspects under review, which most likely have or would have serious negative impacts on these aspects.\n\n#### **Reporting in accordance with EU taxonomy**\n\nThe European Green Deal is a concept developed by the European Commission with the overarching aim of transitioning towards a competitive, resource-efficient and climate-neutral European economy. To achieve this goal, different actions have been defined for such areas as energy supply, traffic, trade, industry, agriculture and forestry as well as financial market regulation.\n\nOne element of the European Green Deal includes the objective of the EU taxonomy, which furthers sustainable investments by designing a common classification system on what environmentally sustainable economic activities across all sectors are. The respective mandatory reporting which was launched for capital market-guided enterprises is to give users the transparent and uniform possibility to compare the sustainability of business models.\n\nArticle 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation specifies six environmental objectives of the European Union:\n\n- Climate change mitigation\n- Climate change adaptation\n- The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- The transition to a circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control\n- The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nFor the financial year 2021, the disclosure focused initially on the first two objectives only due to the facilitation granted by the EU, i.e., Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation, regarding the proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the overall turnover as well as in capital expenditures and operational expenses. Since this facilitation option has been dropped for the financial year 2022, the reporting covered not only taxonomy eligibility, but also examined taxonomy alignment. Due to the Environmental Delegated Act, reporting for the 2023 financial year is required on all six environmental objectives. In accordance with the facilitation granted for the 2021 financial year, the disclosure obligations for the 2023 financial year with regard to the four new environmental objectives \"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\", \"Transition to a circular economy\", \"Pollution prevention and control\" and \"Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\" also only include the assessments of possible taxonomy eligibility in each case.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities include those established and described in the Climate/Environmental Delegated Act as they are relevant for the environmental objectives named. Moreover, identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities are considered to be taxonomy aligned if they meet the so-called technical screening criteria, which are fundamentally composed of two components: (1) substantial contribution towards one of the named environmental objectives; and (2) do no harm to other environmental objectives.\n\nFurthermore, it must be ensured that minimum social safeguards are met (in accordance with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO core labour standards and the International Bill of Human Rights).\n\ncewe group\n\nements 6 Fur\n\n→ Separate consolidated non-financial report\n\n**Risk assessment**\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\nnon-financial report\n\nThe individual key indicators are established by applying the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are used for the consolidated financial statements and take all fully consolidated Group companies into consideration. The overall turnover concurs with the value shown in the profit and loss account for the financial year concerned. Overall capital expenditures are defined as the sum of gross additions to the tangible and intangible fixed assets during the year under review without goodwill acquired. Overall operational expenses encompass all direct, non-capitalised costs connected to research & development, renovation measures, short-term leases as well as upkeep and maintenance or repair. For calculation of the figures, the financial indicators turnover, operational expenses (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX) were analysed regarding their taxonomy eligibility. Data from the annual report and the consolidation system were evaluated in order to identify the proportion of turnover, as well as capital expenditures and operational expenses, that can be attributable to taxonomy-eligible economic activities. The individual items are clearly allocated to the respective category and environmental objectives so that nothing was counted twice.\n\nThe following information reflects CEWE's own assessment. The legislative acts published so far on the Taxonomy Regulation only contain activities of particular relevance to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, and no activities for the other four environmental objectives. For the CEWE Group, no turnover-relevant economic activities have been classified according to the current status of the regulations and no turnover could be established that is eligible under the taxonomy. Depending on the specific content of the Regulation, however, taxonomy-compliant revenues could be determined for the CEWE Group for the next financial years.\n\nThe analysis of economic activities regarding capital expenditure has shown that investments are being made in taxonomy-eligible economic activities relating to the purchase of products and services named under Annex I (Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation) of the delegated act. This refers mainly to bicycle traffic and the vehicle fleet (Activities 6.4 and 6.5) as well as measures for renewable energy (Activity 7.6).\n\nFurthermore, operational expenses have been identified that relate to the purchase of products and services from taxonomy-eligible economic activity as named under Annex I (Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation) of the delegated regulation.

Assurance Engagement of the Combined Non-Financial Report **1**\n\n### To CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined non-financial report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA, Oldenburg, (hereinafter referred to as CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA or the Company), including the parts qualified by references as components for the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the \"combined non-financial report\") to obtain limited assurance.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Executive Directors**\n\nThe executive directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the combined non-financial report in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB [\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report.\n\nThis responsibility of the executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### **Independence and Quality Management of the Assurance Practitioner's Firm**\n\nWe have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements in particular the By-laws Regulating the Rights and Duties of Wirtschaftsprüfer and vereidigte Buchprüfer in the exercise of their Profession as well as the IDW Quality Management Standards issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW), and\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined non-financial report and issued an Independent Practitioner's Report in German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the original German Independent Practitioner's Report.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n4 Remuneration\n\n→ Independent auditor's report\n\naccordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n#### **Practitioner's Responsibility**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial report based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the group's combined non-financial financial report of the Company for the period of January 1st to December 31st, 2023 with the exception of the external sources of documentation or expert opinions in the combined non-financial financial report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report. This does not mean that a separate audit opinion is expressed on each of the disclosures.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities, particularly:\n\n- Obtainment of an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the employees responsible for the materiality analysis in order to gain an understanding of the procedure for identifying material topics and corresponding reporting boundaries of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA\n- A risk assessment, including a media analysis, of relevant information about CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA's sustainability performance during the reporting period\n- Assessment of the suitability of internally developed definitions\n- Analytical assessment of selected quantitative data\n- Inquiries of personnel responsible for determining the disclosures relating to concepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control procedures and consolidating the disclosures\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents\n- Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-aligned activities and the corresponding disclosures in the combined non-financial report\n- Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n206\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### **Assurance Opinion**\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the combined non-financial report of CEWE Stiftung & Co. KGaA for the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors as disclosed in section \"Reporting according to EU Taxonomy\" of the combined non-financial report.\n\n#### **Restriction of Use**\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the parent company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the parent company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.\n\n## **General Engagement Terms**\n\nThis engagement is based on the \"Special Engagement Terms and Conditions of BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\" of March 1st, 2021, agreed with the Company as well as the \"General Engagement Terms and Conditions for Auditors and Auditing Firms\" of January 1st, 2017, issued by the IDW ( **[www.bdo.de/de-de/auftragsbedingungen](https://www.bdo.de/en-gb/engagement-terms-conditions)**).\n\nMunich, March 19th, 2024\n\nBDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nThorben Kunze Carmen Auer Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\ncewe group\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nt 4 Remuneration\n\n5 Financial Statements\n\n6 Further Information\n\n→ Financial statements of CEWE Stiftung & Co.
